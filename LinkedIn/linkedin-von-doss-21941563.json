It keeps you moving and makes you get up everyday trying to do better then you did yesterday. The great thing is I've been blessed to work for a company that has that same drive from the top to the bottom.One of my new favorite quotes (yes I'm a quote guy) is from JJ Watt:\"Success isn't owned, it's leased.
