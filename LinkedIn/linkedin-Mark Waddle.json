She has a wealth of knowledge, picks up new subjects with ease, and is a pleasure to work with.One outstanding contribution of many during our two years working together consisted of a novel approach to content relevance ranking. She developed the prototype independently, and her design intentionally enabled the system to be implemented with low engineering effort, while maintaining user privacy and prediction accuracy.I highly recommend Claire for any team in search of a needle moving data scientist!"
