        "summary": "    The not-so-fascinating truth:I'm an Art History major who accidentally discovered an obsession with cool tech stuff. From that point on, I knew I belonged with data-driven companies who recognize that predictive analytics is the future of HR and Talent Acquisition.  My major interests are Spock (don't tell my Star Wars-oriented family), NY-style pizza and baking. At Carvana, I focus on Technical Recruitment, which seems to be the closest I can get to The Matrix. Still waiting for Morpheus to offer me the red or blue pills; it would be a tough decision considering how much fun we have on Carvana's IT & Engineering teams. In addition to recruitment, I act as Carvana's ATS Admin (Greenhouse) and assist with vendor management.My goals for the next few years are:- to help Carvana reach its full potential as a car buying experience that doesn't suck- to assist in making our HR and Recruitment software as efficient and streamlined as possible- to finally master my interview poker face- to build the smartest, most curious team of IT, analytics and engineering professionals this side of the Mississippi. You know what I mean?\n  \n  \n",
