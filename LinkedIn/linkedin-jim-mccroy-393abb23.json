It has been especially strong here in Phoenix. I believe now is the time to take advantage of this momentum—particularly by the people who call these communities home. As an experienced business consultant and licensed real estate agent, I am focused on helping businesses and individuals solve their real estate needs.I am not your normal Business Consultant or Realtor. I provide a high level service to my clients, founded on the principal that everyone should be treated with respect. This, accompanied with my diverse business experience, allows me to find solutions others can’t and help make positive changes in a community I am proud to call home. In this line of business, I am always looking for contacts. I hope to develop partnerships with investors who not only want an attractive return, but also desire to be a part of a positive redevelopment in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area; architects, engineers, and contractors who manage projects with a keen sensitivity to the urban setting of each property; and business entrepreneurs who strive to capitalize on unique community needs. Together, we will collaborate to create successful business initiatives."
