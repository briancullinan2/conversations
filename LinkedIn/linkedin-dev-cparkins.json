I enjoy exploring the ever-changing fields of technology and love to tackle software-related problems with modern solutions.I have a solid history of various software technologies including: PHP, JavaEE, Spring, CodeIgniter, VB.NET, C#, C/C++, MySQL, MSSQL, Sybase, and more!I also have experience with customizing Drupal and WordPress CMS. Many of the time, I would have to integrate these systems with external systems such as ApplicationXtender (document management), Zendesk, and Salesforce (CRM).Lastly, I've had the opportunity to build a working and practical Agile SDLC process from the ground up. I very much love to build these processes because they often have the opportunity to impact all departments in an organization.\n  \n  \n",
