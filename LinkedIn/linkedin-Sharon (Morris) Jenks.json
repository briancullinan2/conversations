                "It’s my pleasure to provide this letter of recommendation for Kathleen, who has worked as an Event Manager for our networking organization for the past 6 months. As her direct manager who worked closely with her throughout her time here, I was impressed with her work ethic, friendly personality, and ability to work well under pressure. As an Event Manager at 6 Degrees Business Networking, Kathleen demonstrated outstanding customer service. Our community is a mix of young professionals, mid- level career professionals and business owners and Kathleen was personable and professional toward all. Even when things got hectic during event set-up, Kathleen kept up her energy level and attention to detail. Kathleen is thorough, friendly, and helpful, all qualities that makes her an excellent addition to our staff.Finding venues and vendors for over 30 events a year is no small task. It requires phone calls, follow-up emails and site visits. Reminders to everyone including food and beverage vendors, non-profits, and AV has to be at top of mind so that everyone shows up early to set-up before our guests arrive.Our events include evening networking mixers, Cigar Society mixers, Breakfast Speakers Series and educational events. Each of these require a specific attention to detail.

                "It’s my pleasure to provide this letter of recommendation for Kathleen, who has worked as an Event Manager for our networking organization for the past 6 months. As her direct manager who worked closely with her throughout her time here, I was impressed with her work ethic, friendly personality, and ability to work well under pressure. As an Event Manager at 6 Degrees Business Networking, Kathleen demonstrated outstanding customer service. Our community is a mix of young professionals, mid- level career professionals and business owners and Kathleen was personable and professional toward all. Even when things got hectic during event set-up, Kathleen kept up her energy level and attention to detail. Kathleen is thorough, friendly, and helpful, all qualities that makes her an excellent addition to our staff.Finding venues and vendors for over 30 events a year is no small task. It requires phone calls, follow-up emails and site visits.

Without the \"why\" how can we know something is important? Without the \"why\" how can I know what's important to you? As a high theoretical, Dr. Covey's 5th Habit resonated with me...\"Seek to first understand then to be understood\".  This has served my clients well and I attribute it to my success.My fascination with executive behavior culminated with the founding of Performance Solutions, an organization dedicated to the training and behavioral development of senior executives which today is knows as The Jenks Group, Inc. I am a well-known executive coach having helped some of the country’s top business professionals in the Silicon Valley to reach their goals. A survivor of cancer, I am passionate about helping others who need  someone who understands. I am a past Chairman of the Fremont Chamber of Commerce, and the Humane Society Truckee Tahoe. I am the proud owner of three rescue dogs currently, who have always found me. My goal is to one day own and operate an \"Old Dog Sanctuary\" for those senior rescues that often get looked over for a puppy.•I am an extremely creative, organized, detail-obsessed, self-starter with the the ability to juggle multiple projects yet stay calm under pressure •Enthusiastic, entrepreneurial, a problem solver, a go-getter and above all, a team player •Experience preserving margin and have implemented strategies to improve •Efficient in all social media outlets •Certified Professional Behavioral Analyst•Expert in Strategic Planning \n  \n  \n",
