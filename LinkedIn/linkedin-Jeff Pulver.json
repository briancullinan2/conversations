                "Back in 1996, our first gathering about Voice and Video on the Internet helped seed the Internet Communications revolution. Looking back, many of the people who attended that first summit became the movers and the shakers behind more than 200 startups. In 1997 our gathering morphed into VON / Voice on the Net and thru 2008 these conferences became the meeting place where the future of communications evolved and where VoIP became the standard of the global telecommunications industry. Our conversations explored the state of the technology, the gaps in the markets of the then current products and public policy as we looked into the future. From the opportunity presented, we collectively raised billions of dollars and many delegates became competitors, players and positive disruptors in the telecommunications space. What resulted was the largest boom of innovation in communications in the past 50 years. During the days of VON over 120 of our exhibitors were acquired by 7 of our other exhibitors. Quite a number of startups went public and at times we hosted delegations from 40 to 65 different countries at the US events. MoNage: Messaging is the New Voice is a new event series started to bring together the leading thinkers, end users, and companies in the Internet Communications, Blockchain, Computing, and AI Industries and. The power, and potential, of Messaging in all its forms, is what MoNage is all about. Our goal is to build a community of people and companies to help grow the technology, usage, and business of Messaging. Messaging is a big and exciting field, with many areas of interest, including Chatbots, Enterprise-level messaging systems, blockchain messaging, security and encryption, interoperability among messaging platforms, new and exiting user conversational interfaces (think Amazon Alexa and other voice interfaces), and rich content capability.  Fall 2017 MoNage will be taking place October 24-26 in Boston. More information a http://monage.io"

This landmark decision was the first decision it made on IP communications. Now referred to as \"the Pulver Order\", the ruling provides important clarification that computer-to-computer VoIP service is not a telecommunications service. By doing this, the FCC delivered a strong signal to consumers and capital markets that the FCC is not interested in subjecting end-to-end IP Communications services to traditional voice telecommunications regulation under the Communications Act.\n  \n  \n",
