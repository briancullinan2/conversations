                "I teach people how to properly protect themselves with insurance products. With only 3% of all people carrying great coverage, I see almost everyone can use a little help. I love giving advice. Most agents quote on price, I quote on \"how much money do you want if you will never walk?\"I teach people how to get free renters insurance or free life insurance when they combine their auto insurance with renters insurance. Full coverage covers the vehicle, not the injuries past $15k. How far will $15k go if you are going to spend your life in a wheelchair? How far will it go if you have a shattered hip?  I teach people how to protect themselves. Insurance is for the big accidents not the small claims. If you hit someone: rates can go up, carfax value could drop car value by thousandscould get sued personallyI ask my clients and friends to call me back to back to back in an emergency.Jayson Hoffer480-518-0747 8am-10pmjhoffer@farmersagent.comSpecialties:  Auto InsuranceCar Insurance Homeowners Insurance Business Insurance General Liability Insurance Term Life Insurance Cash Value Permanent Life Insurance Key Man Life Insurance Whole Life Insurance ( we have better products today, but this is available) Health Insurance Realtor Insurance CPA & Accountant Insurance Commercial Real Estate Insurance Commercial Habitational Insurance Commercial Auto Insurance Commercial Wholesale Distr Insurance Retirement Planning, 401k, SIMPLE, SEP, IRA, Roth, Traditional, Mutual Funds Restaurant Insurance Hotel Insurance Umbrella Insurance Workers Compensation Insurance Insurance Risk MedicareHigh Risk InsuranceBusiness owner Life InsuranceAfter 13 years of being an agent I can guide you through your claims.
