                "July 5, 2010, Michael worked with Mark in the same group",
                "I have been in sales and sales management for over 30 years – and, I have honestly never been more impressed with anyone than Michael Fulcher.  The best way to describe Michael is with four words “Michael is a leader.”  From the moment I met Michael (working as a colleague of his at OdysseyWare in Arizona) I knew he was a person “in charge” (even before he spoke).   Growing up the son of a Marine he walks and moves like someone you want on your side during battle.  When he walks into a room it’s as if his presence precedes him.  He always exudes great respect wherever he goes.  And yet, beneath his military carriage is a great warmth, kindness and desire to make things better for all he befriends. I sincerely never learned more about managing people than I have by just watching Michael work.  I think the best endorsement I could give to anyone is … if ever I were in a position to hire Michael, I would do so in less than a heartbeat."
