        "summary": "    Executive Producer / Director /  Cinematographer / Trash Taker Outter  I decided to tie my ability as a film maker, graphic designer, & web marketing strategist to launch So-Cal Video Productions. Teaching myself through experimentation and trial & error; I soon found himself creating original works for my employer. Creating dozens of Training Videos, Web Marketing & Development; even Television and Web Spots. It then occurred to me that I could branch out on my own; doing what I loved. So.... I did!

Story-telling by way of collaboration with other talented individuals, from all walks of life, can bring a very powerful perspective to an audience.
