You would be part of the planning team to redesign while maintaining current product. \nThey are looking for Full Stack and Java developers. Full Stack Developers who are both proficient in .Net and Java are preferred. Also previous experience working in an agile environment would be an asset.\n\nDescription: Looking for Backend and Full Stack Java Developers as a base line. Which project the software engineers end up working on will depend on their experience. The main focus is split into 2:\n1. Providing infrastructure for analytics, with the majority of the work on projects that are updating/enhancing and maintaining legacy systems. \n2. Assisting in a parallel effort of designing, architecting the front end and back end of the next version product.\nRequired Skills: \n• Java\n• SQL\n• Spring\n• Javascript\n• JQuery\n• XML\n• jMock and jUnit for unit testing\n• Agile / Scrum environment experience\n\nDesired Skills: \n• Legacy Software update experience is Highly preferred\n• Struts\n• Time series databases, Relational Databases\n• Windows\n• Linux\n• Thread safe\n• jBoss\n• High performance / fault tolerance\n• Multiple forms of testing such as black/white box, load, regression, etc. \n\nWhat's in it for you? :)\n\nThey currently offer benefits after 60 days of employment \n401K match after 30 days of employment. (matching 4% to the first 5% invested)\nYearly Reviews \nMonthly Team Building Activities: Kayaking, potlucks, breakfasts, Team luncheons, Bowling..etc..\nMonthly Lunch and Learns\nSalary is competitive\n\nDoes this give you a good enough idea of the role? I realize Phoenix is a BIG city so location (and commutability!) might be of interest to you and your colleagues. The client has said that some of this work can be done from home. So their preference is that new employees spend the first 2 weeks in the office working with the team before telecommuting is possible. It sounds like a fun team. You might also want to work in the office. If this role sounds of interest to you we should schedule a phone conversation this week. Looking forward to your feedback.\n\nthank you and kind regards,\n\nMichelle Walsh\nTeam Lead",
