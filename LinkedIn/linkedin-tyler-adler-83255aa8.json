Introduced an architectural strategy that saved hundreds of thousands in licensing costs for the company.•\tAssisted InfoSec team in moving to a new security platform on each system, both Windows and Linux.  Wrote a PowerShell script from scratch to automate the deployment of the new security software, saving weeks in employee time.•\tSpearheaded the migration of our backup platform.  Architected and build the platform per vendor specifications and recommendations, yielding a 20-fold increase in backup/restore performance on the physical systems, virtual machines, and databases.  Created automated tasks via scripts to perform weekly test restores on each backup environment, which in turn automatically send email reports for validation of good backups.•\tWas assigned a project that involved standing up 16 systems and configure a vendor application within a 1-week period.  Through the use of PowerShell scripts and other means of automation, I was able to build the environment with the required software in 2 days, beating expectations.•\tAssigned a project to migrate a reporting platform from old physical systems to our virtual environment.  Working closely with the application vendor, we successfully migrated the data and infrastructure.  However, the owner of the platform (a manager) was spending hours every single morning manually cleaning up old reports from the platform as he had done for years.  After doing some research on the platform, I was able to create a script which performed the cleanup operation automatically, saving thousands of dollars in employee time."

His abilities exuberate confidence and continuously produce the best solution quickly and efficiently.  Tyler executes and strategically plans with superiority and with his client's interests and needs as priority one.  Organized is another word that would accurately describe Tyler; he's got that down too!  No ticket, big or small, goes unanswered, forgotten, or pushed aside.  Tyler always acts and performs out of best practice.  In addition, and importantly, Tyler never geek speaks my team and is able to quickly establish one's level of knowledge to elect best language to be spoken.

Tyler is incredibly and abundantly skilled in the vast areas of the technology industry.  We haven't been able to stump him with our tech needs here at Climate Pro.  He's got script and cmd syntax memorized and ready to execute haha.  We had an issue that went months without resolve with our prior tech company, and Tyler had it resolved within his first 5 minutes of being onsite at Climate Pro for the first time; talk about making a great first impression!  His abilities exuberate confidence and continuously produce the best solution quickly and efficiently.  Tyler executes and strategically plans with superiority and with his client's interests and needs as priority one.  Organized is another word that would accurately describe Tyler; he's got that down too!  No ticket, big or small, goes unanswered, forgotten, or pushed aside.  Tyler always acts and performs out of best practice.  In addition, and importantly, Tyler never geek speaks my team and is able to quickly establish one's level of knowledge to elect best language to be spoken.  Ultimately, as the Sr IT Technician at AZ Tech Works, Tyler's team truly serve proof as to what kind of leader he is, as their actions, demeanor, and results are a direct and measurable outcome and reflection of his leadership!"
