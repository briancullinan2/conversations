The community surrounding it still awes me in how supportive and giving they are.  There's no shortage of meetups, events, conferences, or things to learn.  I've tried to help out where I can, volunteering for events such as Desert Code Camp, IoT DevFest, and acting as Sponsorship Coordinator for CSSDay.io.Last year was full of learning C# .NET, using Kentico for a larger project.  This year I've come full circle and am becoming more involved with WordPress, improving security for client sites, creating plugins for some interesting use cases, and fixing some 3rd party plugin conflicts so we can increase security without losing functionality.Most recently I've been working on migrating sites to AWS and automating our deployment process along with the usual work in both C# .NET and PHP.\n  \n  \n",
