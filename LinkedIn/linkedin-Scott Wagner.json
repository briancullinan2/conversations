        "summary": "    “There are only two options regarding commitment.  You’re in or out. There is no such thing as life in-between.” Pat Riley. Great quote, even though the 90's Knicks were painful to watchI’ve been described as an all-on and all-in leader, committed to operational excellence, growth mindset and 100% involvement. I enjoy helping people realize their potential and companies maximize their value -- both of which are usually higher than what ‘conventional wisdom’ expects. There’s nothing more rewarding than creating something distinctive and meaningful, particularly when others think or say you can’t do it. I value integrity, hard work, grit, talent, competitive fire and great comedy movies. As COO of GoDaddy I provide leadership for our domain business, website and customer care operations as well as our strategy and finance functions. At GoDaddy, we serve >13mm customers, helping them build a great online presence powered by elegant technology products and personalized customer care. I’m inspired by our customers who are all ‘do’ers’ following their ideas or passions, and by my fellow GoDaddy’ers, who are action oriented, outcome driven, and genuine. I thrive in fast paced, build/fix it environments and learned much of my craft at the global private equity firm KKR, where I was a Partner co-leading the NA portfolio operations team.   At KKR, I learned the value of a) identifying the ~3-4 things that matter to customers and to a business b) driving those 3 things at a detailed level c) building a great team(s) with vibrant, talented people and d) that speed and simplicity win in both business and life.   I live in the Bay Area with my brilliant wife Julianne and my three kids. I love California, but am a Midwestern guy who also believes New York City is the greatest city in the world and nothing else is close. When I’m not working, you can find me involved with one my of kid’s numerous sports & activities.\n  \n  \n",
