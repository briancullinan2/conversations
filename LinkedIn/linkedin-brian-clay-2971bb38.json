        "summary": "    Hai!My name is Brian and you probably know that cause it's in bold size 18 font above. What you didn't know though is that I've been in the IT field now for over 9 years and have had a very profound exposure to many different facets and technologies. Currently, I'm a hired gun doing some BA work for a large healthcare provider and we're coming up with some great technology solutions to tackle the challenges of a growing and changing healthcare landscape. Prior to this though, I was working on a software release team in Denver, Colorado. One of the best companies I've ever had the pleasure to be a part of. A true agile shop that is making their name for themselves in a big way in the Web Conferencing sphere. I've also done quite a bit of the QA and automated testing for a few large companies, and even dabbled in some front-end design and product ownership roles. Each new challenge has brought on new rewards and increased my knowledge and my passion for the IT field.I try to bring everything I have to the table. Over my tenure I've been able to interact with a vast array of technologies and methodologies, I'll include just a snapshot of buzzwords that apply to my skill set: Agile, Lean, Kanban, ,NET, Java, JS, Bootstrap, WebStorm, HTLM5, Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Stash, Selenium, Term2 and then of course my enterprise level (Waterfall) experience using  LoadRunner, Quality Center, Salesforce, MS Visio (and the rest of the MS Office Suite), and Visual Studio. In a nutshell, I'm passionate about technology and how it can create solutions to existing problems. I love working with teams and collaborating together to come up with innovative ideas. And in the interest of full disclosure, I hate the word \"Synergy\". And that is pretty much me in a nutshell. Cheers.\n  \n  \n",
