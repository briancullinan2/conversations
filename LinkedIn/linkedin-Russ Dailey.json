        "summary": "    Excited to be blending all of my skills at my dream job. My father owned, operated, manufactured fireplaces in the Pacific Northwest.  He was successful in patenting a new fireplace technology based on an innovative airflow process that became his award-winning Fireplace Xtrordinair. I spent thousands of hours working alongside him in my youth, absorbing knowledge and his energy.  I loved to work with my hands, but I happened to shine in IT as well.  I went to school and graduated with a degree in Computer Science & Business Administration MIS.  I went to work in San Francisco for a financial market data provider where I learned a lot about the financial markets and high-frequency data providers.  I then moved to the internet powerhouse, GoDaddy.com where I became educated on the entirety of the web, plus how to work with Fortune 500 companies.  From there I was one of 3 innovators who started Avisolve, an Arizona Technology Broker as VP of Business Development. There I successfully cultivated many of the large and small vendor relationships.  Now I am CTO at Instant Data Centers, LLC (IDC).  We design & manufacture edge infrastructure solutions for the data center.   The Edge Infrastructures are Micro Data Centers at the rack level which includes cooling and all features you'd see in a traditional large-scale data center.  In a significant step, IDC has purchased Elliptical Mobile Systems (EMS), and I am excited that we at IDC have already integrated the entire product line, patents, and manufacturing process.  IDC has come to market now with innovative new designs and now proven products from EMS.  The Micro Data Center space is a very exciting place to be right now, and with my leadership, IDC will be a major player.  Today our most prominent market are Natural Resources (Mining, Construction & Oil & Gas), Government & Telecommunications. \n  \n  \n",
