Then I met Josh and his wife at WordCamp San Francisco. They were charming and personable. Page.ly offered to sponsor the East Bay WordPress Meetup and we have had our website there since 2010. The service has been solid, secure, and reliable. I pester Josh personally via Twitter whenever I have a problem. He sends me to support, but they always respond quickly and get whatever it is sorted out in record time. Josh is good at communicating with his customers and works steadily to improve the service that Page.ly offers. I look forward to working more with Josh and with Page.ly in the future."

        "summary": "    Joshua Strebel is the Co-Founder and CEO of Pagely, the first-to-market and leading premium Managed WordPress Hosting provider. Throughout Joshua’s career he has only known the path of an entrepreneur, leading teams in creative web services, and Web hosting at the companies he has founded. Never having a 'real job' after college Joshua is a self taught professional in design, development, marketing, and business. Beginning in 2003, Joshua and his and wife Sally co-founded and grew a boutique web design agency to a modest level of success in Scottsdale, Arizona. From 2008 on he transitioned that company away from web design and development services to the hosting space focusing exclusively on WordPress. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, Pagely has grown into a successful operation supporting such brands as Visa, Disney, and Time Inc. to deploy, manage, and scale their WordPress applications.Joshua has never been listed on a \"Top X of Y\" or a \"# under #\" or been honored as \"Top X of the Valley\". However, he has successfully bootstrapped an innovative, culture first, 100% remote, web application hosting company generating several million in annual revenue fueled by the simple philosophy that \"business is personal\".Off the clock Joshua is a husband and father, automobile enthusiast, aging snow sports participant, and connoisseur of single malt scotch.\n  \n  \n",
