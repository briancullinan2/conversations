No matter what the circumstances are, no matter what the setting is, even if you are the one leading a workshop or a talk, be in the mindset to learn.  As I continue to meet so many amazing people this year, I am blown away by the ideas, stories and drive coming out of others.  I go to events and I meet someone and I always seem to learn something new. I do workshops and I pay attention to how others respond and I listen to their feedback, input and questions, and I learn.  I recently did a guest talk for a group of Seniors in the Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University.  Thru their answers, questions and curiosity about how to approach their career, I learned from them.  I'll be better the next time I do a workshop because of what I learned from that audience of students last night.  CALL TO ACTION:  Be mindful of listening and learning in every single interaction and conversation you have.  It benefits you, and it benefits others.",

He has personality and persuasive power. How may he accomplish transformation? First he has theory. He understands why the transformation would bring gain to his organization and to all the people that his organization deals with, the customers, suppliers, environment. Second, he feels compelled to accomplish the transformation as an obligation to himself and to his organization. Third, he is a practical man. He has a plan, step by step.” - W.
