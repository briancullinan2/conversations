As we look at pioneers Alwun House — Kim Moody (Founder 1971) and Dana Johnson (Foundation Board President). You were here first, and everything else we’ve done is on your shoulders.”"

For more than 40 years, the Alwun House foundation has created opportunities for artists and served as a pivotal beacon in the Garfield community and as a foundation for the downtown Phoenix arts scene. Their work extends across artistic and cultural boundaries, and brings diverse audiences, community members and artists together. Without the pioneering work of Alwun House, much of what is taken for granted in the vibrancy and success of downtown’s flourishing arts community would not have been possible.”\n  \n  \n",
