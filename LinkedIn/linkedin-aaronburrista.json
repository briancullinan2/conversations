                "Matt was an excellent hire. He was able to go on to our client site and really hit the ground running. His work was excellent and BlueKC was happy with his attention to detail and reliability in doing his job right the first time. As a person that recruited Matt he was very punctual and has an honest personality that makes him very easy to work with. I would recommend Matt for nearly every Project Management opening as he has the ability to see high level projects to completion and bring them in on time, on budget, and within the project scope. He focuses on managing not only the project itself but the people within that project to ensure all technical and business needs are being met."
