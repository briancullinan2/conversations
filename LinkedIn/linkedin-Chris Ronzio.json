There comes a point in your business growth where you need to drop your ego and ask for help. One of my businesses recently scaled up faster than we were ready for and left us with more clients than we knew what to do with, unorganized (although we are all OCD), and running at full speed just to put out fires and maintain our work load.I hired Chris for 2 full days of consulting and he has helped my business do a complete 180. He helped on the following topics: systems, procedures, on-boarding, management, process flow, organization, automation, and so much more.Within 45 days of completing my consulting with Chris, we have doubled our monthly revenue and increased productivity by 30% within our core team and workflow.I recommend Chris to any business who is starting out, at their revenue cap and needs to move past its plateau or simply just wants to streamline their business which in turn lowers expenses and increases profits."

Had I known how much an impact he would have on my business and even my mindset, I would've done it sooner. Every meeting was extremely productive. We actually took care of things right then and there rather than me leaving with a laundry list of things to do. He helped remove a number roadblocks on our path to growth. Chris is extremely efficient, with an uncanny ability to quickly get to the root of the problem. On top of it all, he's deeply empathetic and understands the unique struggles entrepreneurs go through – personally and professionally – because he is one.  I highly recommend working with Chris."
