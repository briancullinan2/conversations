        "summary": "    My fight with breast cancer 8 years ago led me to start the non-profit Don't be a Chump! Check for a Lump! My passion had led this grassroots organization to becoming a prominent figure in the breast cancer community in the greater metropolitan Phoenix area.  Since the inception of our non-profit I have helped to inspire and educate thousands of women with the facts and tips to lowering their risk of breast cancer. We have assisted over 800 breast cancer patients with a free wig, 222 of the women in 2016. We have hosted free mammogram events providing 45 free mammograms including any diagnostic testing necessary.  I'm honored and blessed to be making a difference in the breast cancer community. Speaking Testimony“Holly Rose combines the science of breast cancer with personal stories to connect with her audience. Listening to her is like listening to a close friend and by the end of her presentation you are moved to make a difference.”Testimony for a client receiving a free mammogram.“I am 37 yrs old I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. I owe it all to Holly Rose because I had no medical insurance and had found a lump in September. I needed to get this lump checked out. I was actually her first client on a program she wanted to kick off by helping women without insurance. I am a single mother with 3 children and I couldn't tell you how happy I am to be a part of such a wonderful organization. Love ya Holly Rose and I am forever grateful.” Contact Holly Rose (Toner) at hollyrose@checkforlump.org 602-688-5232\n  \n  \n",
