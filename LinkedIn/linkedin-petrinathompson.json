She amazes me with her ability to understand all areas of the business, both high and detailed level, paired with an intuitiveness to quickly know at what level her team needs her. Working with Trina has simply been fun. She brings her mind and energy to every encounter to drive her team to do their best, think strategically and address all the details. She has helped me solve countless problems in the IT department, as we transformed the company to follow best practices and repeatable processes. The most impressive trait of Trina’s is her humanness. She sincerely cares about the individuals on her team and works to understand how to engage them to grow in their role. I left every meeting with Trina equipped with new creative ideas and inspiration to move our initiatives forward.  Status quo and stagnation are not options with her leadership."
