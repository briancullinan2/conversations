I met amazing people there, many of whom I still consider friends, and the expertise and passion I was exposed to has helped me pivot my career in recent years, better identify organizations and people who are worth working with and investing in, and develop the grit needed to maintain innovative thinking and habits in a very inflexible business world. It's also ingrained in me a deep appreciation for serendipity in both personal and professional endeavors. Thank you, Derek!"
