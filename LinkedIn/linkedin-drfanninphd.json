        "summary": "    I have been involved in the field of neuroscience for two decades and have been regarded as one of the foremost Brain Performance Experts in the country. My Ph.D. in Psychology, an MBA and a Bachelor of Science degree in Mass Communications led me to the idea and creation of the Center for Cognitive Enhancement that later transformed into Thought Genius, LLC where my team of experts and I have been brainmapping and training the brain for over 17 years. I work with the complex practice of mapping and analyzing the brain, then training the brain for brain health and brain fitness.I have used my training to work with traumatic brain injury, stroke, chronic pain, Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, depression, as well as personal performance related to academics, sports and executive leadership training to  enhance mental and emotional dexterity. My cutting edge research, co-authored with Rob Williams and published in a variety of peer-reviewed science journals presenting accurate measures in creating balanced brainwave energy. For the past four years my team and I have been doing international research with Dr. Joe Dispenza regarding personal transformation. I was part of a research team at Arizona State University researching neuroscience and leadership. Our studies have involved work at the United States Military Academy at West Point; my work related to neuroscience and leadership allowed  me to teach it at Arizona State University and this work has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, on Fox News, Business Week, London Financial Times, in Singapore’s Weekend Edition, BBC radio and many more.I am completing a book for publication: Thought Genius: Commanding The Power of Thought. Recognizing that thought is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. This book teaches you how to harness your thoughts, connecting them with universal principles to be, do or have anything you desire.\n  \n  \n",
