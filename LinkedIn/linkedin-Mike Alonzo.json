Don’t let the baby face fool you, I first cut my teeth in tech startups in the late 90’s, when the internet was delivered on CD-Rom and “getting mail” was the highlight of your day.My background is in digital product development, user experience, and visual design. I love challenging entrepreneurs to apply purpose to their actions to maximize execution.I’m a unique hybrid of creative and analytical thinking, giving me the pixel perfection of a designer, problem solving of a developer, and strategic foresight of an executive. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to experience the highs and lows of start-up life, the perks and monotony of the corporate grind, and the exhilaration and terror of entrepreneurship.\n  \n  \n",
