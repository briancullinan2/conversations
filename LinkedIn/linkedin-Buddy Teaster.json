Buddy Teaster joined YPO as Chief Networks Officer about one year after I had joined the organization's Senior Management Team. He built the Networks Team from the bottom up, worked amazingly well with member volunteers as well as his peers and 3 - 4 years later had between 60 - 70 fully functioning personal and business networks in YPO-WPO - a feat that was recognized publicly by the Board of Directors. I would not hesitate to recommend Buddy for leadership roles and would be proud to work with him again."

Buddy has worked with CEOs, as the demanding constituents they are, in structured and unstructured circumstances for more than a decade.Starting with his personal traits – were fundamental leadership is rooted – Buddy is centered; intelligent; generous in his acceptance of diverse points of view; and yet he is a subtle focused driver who gets the job done through having others buy-in to supporting his vision.Buddy works effectively in complete environments with for instance CEOs on a global basis and understands how to draw out unspoken needs and expectations. He is current on technologies and programs that help connect people around their interests and passions.  Buddy is humble and will tell you that he runs once in awhile – and you will then learn he ran a 100 mile race the previous weekend.  He will tell you that the team did a great job – and then you will learn he did it himself over the weekend as no one quite understood was what required.Working with Buddy is a pleasure given his great sense of humor, and his propensity to enjoy life – even when things are difficult, Buddy keeps the team going with an objective comment that keeps everyone smiling and the team moving forward.  Above all, Buddy has a deep sense of integrity that comes through in his work and strength of character that inspires all that work with him.Whatever position Buddy ends up deciding to accept, my hope is to continue to work closely with him and to continue to create value together.Feel free to call me on any questions in regards to Buddy Teaster.Sincerely,Rob FollowsFounding Partner, STS Capital PartnersChair, YPO Social Enterprise NetworksWorldwide Cell:  (314) 330-5899"
