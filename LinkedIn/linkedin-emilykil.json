He leads with understanding and compassion while at the same time setting proper boundaries when necessary.

His designs are beautiful and when I look back at his work from that time period his designs still look relevant to today's design standards.  His design aesthetic is timeless.  Jose's job was to manage all of the web design and logo projects, review work for completion to the clients' specifications, and mentor the staff.  He is awesome.  He leads with understanding and compassion while at the same time setting proper boundaries when necessary.  He is particularly adept at motivating and training junior level designers to the next level of their skill set.  Supremely organized and a hard worker.  Mature and kind.  It was a pleasure working with him and I hope to have the opportunity to work with him again in the future."
