I've studied the brain for over 15 years and is the author of The Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time. At UCLA my research focuses on neuroimaging of mood and anxiety disorders, as well as the development of a novel focused ultrasound neuromodulation technique. Outside of the lab I am a scientific consultant who assists companies with design, operation and analysis of neuroimaging studies. I have also coached the UCLA women's ultimate frisbee team for 12 seasons.
