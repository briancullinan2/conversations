He is honest, hard working and will find a way to make something work when all hope is lost. He is a recommendation I give with the highest merit."

During the course of our 3 years working together, we have done some pretty significant architecturally challenging projects within PayPal.  We worked together to virtualize 90% of the PayPal site on converged VBLOCK technology on VMWARE.  We worked together to make sure that the workloads that we had virtualized, would port over to KVM under OpenStack, and we worked together to consolidate, and re-consolidate a couple of data-centers, ensuring that no outages were taken during the project.  One incident stands out the most with me when working with Matt.  During the time where we were virtualizing ~5,000 machines on VMWARE 5.x, Matt took the time to dig deep down into the weeds of how the I/O performance was going to impact the workloads when moving from Physical mirrored disks to Raid-10 disk environments, how over-subscribing would help or impact us, and if specint translated directly to VMark or not.  These aspects of having him on the team led us to make some architectural changes to the project that lead to much better results by the time we were done.  I'd work with Matt anytime."

My primary focus areas include information security, data centers, virtualization, and systems architecture. I share industry thought leadership with real-world ways to solve problems, but can directly roll up my sleeves as the lead problem solver during a crisis. I’m adept with drawing and presenting to executives, leading technical reviews, have a high-rated speaking tag at conferences, and can communicate effectively at all levels of the organization.  I challenge status quo, have strong provable opinions, and believe that every challenge can be met with a solution.  I thrive in environments that are large and complex, speak waterfall, and agile at use-case development.  I believe that embracing and driving change is important and I look to always put myself in a position where I can be the \"go to\" guy by my expertise, presence, and ability to deliver within infrastructure  and information security\n  \n  \n",
