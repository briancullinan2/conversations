I really like Axosoft (and the GitKraken team in particular); are you thinking of applying there?\nSorry to hear about StudySauce.... I was worried when I resigned from Dynamynd that I wouldn't find another position right away, but a programmer I met at a meetup (Functional First Phoenix) recommended me for an internship, and I'm so much happier there. So, I'm sure something even better will come along for you too!\nI'm really enjoying being able to do what I love all day and learning from other programmers (and I'm learning a tremendous amount about the real world), so I agree that it's been a really great experience. Also, this way I'll be the same age as all the other freshmen when I start college....\nThe cover letter and text analysis idea sounds great, and I hope you get some cool offers (it does seem like a definite advantage being able to apply to a much larger number of companies than if you were to do it all manually).\nJust out of curiosity, do you ever go to meetups? Functional First Phoenix is a good one if you're interested in learning about functional programming... Also, in case it's not already on your radar, Desert Code Camp is coming up soon; maybe I'll see you there?\nB",
