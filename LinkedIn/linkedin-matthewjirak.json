                "\"I had the great pleasure to have Matt Jirak join and enhance the output of our GGB Purchasing Team for his 2015 Summer Internship assignment. I am a Senior Buyer working for a leading Global Bearing Manufacturer. At the end of this assignment, our Purchasing Team, two GGB manufacturing plants, all the suppliers Matt interacted with and GGB personnel are very thankful for the significant contributions Matt afforded us. I was impressed with how comfortably and effectively Matt collaborated with a wide range of GGB colleagues, manufacturing personnel and managers, including Supply Chain Manager, Plant Managers, Marketing Director, Project Manager, approximately 100 in all. . Matt productively accomplished a varied and vast number of Purchasing duties; filing, one daily job PO, communicated a daily SAP On Time Delivery report, co-created a Kanban Plant Process, sourced/visited a new outside Warehouse and much more. I listened to many calls with suppliers and found Matt to conduct each call with great respect and professionalism. No training, coaching or encouragement required. I witnessed Matt’s professionalism, interpersonal skills, negotiation skills, productivity, collaborative skills and so much more. I strongly recommend Matt to any similar role. \""

Andrew consistently demonstrates a strong drive to succeed and an enthusiasm to give back to his university, community, and fraternity. He has been elected as the Academic Standards Chair within our fraternity and it is his responsibility to oversee the academic development of our entire chapter. He works well with the members of our fraternity through his ability to implement flexibility into the scheduling of our study hours and other meetings. He has done an outstanding job in his commitment to creating groups that facilitate and encourage professional development including his sponsorship of our fraternity LinkedIn page. I believe Andrew has an impeccable work ethic and always comes to meetings well prepared to inform his peers about his responsibilities. He never overburdens himself and has set clear priorities. His ability to respond to critical feedback is also highly admirable because he has demonstrated a skill in adaptability to the suggestions and ideas of our fraternity.

I had the pleasure of working with Andrew in coordinating the logistics behind a dodgeball tournament and barbecue for over seventy five people in the spring of 2014. He quickly assumed a leadership role among our team and profusely engaged his peers with ideas about our event. Andrew consistently demonstrates a strong drive to succeed and an enthusiasm to give back to his university, community, and fraternity. He has been elected as the Academic Standards Chair within our fraternity and it is his responsibility to oversee the academic development of our entire chapter. He works well with the members of our fraternity through his ability to implement flexibility into the scheduling of our study hours and other meetings. He has done an outstanding job in his commitment to creating groups that facilitate and encourage professional development including his sponsorship of our fraternity LinkedIn page. I believe Andrew has an impeccable work ethic and always comes to meetings well prepared to inform his peers about his responsibilities. He never overburdens himself and has set clear priorities. His ability to respond to critical feedback is also highly admirable because he has demonstrated a skill in adaptability to the suggestions and ideas of our fraternity. Andrew Hickey would undoubtedly be an asset to any team in the future and I recommend him enthusiastically and without reservation. Please contact me (610) 883-1444 or mjirak@asu.edu if you have any further questions."
