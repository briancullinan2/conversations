                "Working with Tracy has been a real pleasure.  Our growth targets have been significantly higher than what either she or I had experienced prior to joining Zenefits, and her ability to deliver in a high pressure, high volume environment has been remarkable.  She's easily been my \"right hand man\" while managing our Engineering growth, and has naturally taken on the lead role in training and ramping all of our new team members.  She works very well with our executive team and they trust her as much as I do to get things done well.  I've rarely come across a recruiter like Tracy and feel fortunate to have managed her and had her help in tackling this amazing growth.  I don't think we could have been nearly as successful without her."

I believe in biting off a little more than you can chew and then figuring out how to make it work. I believe in doing the right thing. I believe in “being the change you seek.”  I believe that the smartest people share, collaborate, and elevate themselves and those around them. I believe in high fives and honest conversations and community building.  HR and Recruiting should be about creating and implementing optimal processes and solutions that make it possible and rewarding for people to do the greatest work of their lives; about creating environments that remind people why they chose their careers and what they love about their work.   It should be about hiring the right people, and leveraging the right data, to take a company from “great” to “off-the-charts amazing,\" and finding that perfect balance between the “human element” and a successfully run business.\n  \n  \n",
