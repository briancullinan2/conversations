Chris has an innate ability to rally the troops like no other by sharing his vision while it becomes yours as well.  Chris creates a fun, productive environment for those on his team to push themselves in new ways that collectively produce truly outstanding results, which is how the team at XOOM.COM rose to the occasion to pioneer user generated content and direct marketing on the Web.  I'll never forget the victory laps we'd run at the end of each week celebrating the successes we all achieved at XOOM.COM.  I've always enjoyed working with Chris, and look forward to the next time we work together again."
