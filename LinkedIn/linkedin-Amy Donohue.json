        "summary": "    I've always been the social butterfly, even back in elementary school. It's exactly why I got into doing Social Media. It started when I joined Myspace as a comedian and radio DJ, and helped a small business with their profile there. That was in 2005, and I have been helping others on Social Media ever since.I started my own company, The Fab Social, in 2012. I spend a lot of time reading up on the latest trends in Social Media and attending workshops and conferences to keep learning.As a Social Media Consultant, helping small businesses is the greatest reward. They don't understand Social Media. As a former high school teacher, I've got the patience and creativity to teach Social Media to anyone. In the cannabis industry, I teach compliant social media, so brands don't lose their accounts on social networks for not following the rules.Six years ago, I donated my kidney after seeing a tweet. In May 2013, I embarked on a cross-country trip to interview and film other kidney donors, for the documentary \"Social Media Stole My Kidney.\"​ It was funded largely through Indiegogo, by my social media following.I also have a sister who found me on Facebook. I hadn't seen her in over 20 years! So, when people say Social Media is stupid, I have evidence otherwise.One of my favorite things to do is lead workshops to show business owners the correct ways to build their followers and fanbases and how to engage with their audiences.Social media is probably the best tool out there for someone with my experience using it. I've met the coolest & smartest people in my life through social media!  It's also how my friend found someone to donate their kidney to her mom - me!  When people use the phrase \"think outside the box,\"​ they're pretty much talking about me.Specialties: I'm fearless, so I'm always willing to try & learn new things.  I'm great at earning confidence from my clients, because I never speak TO them, I speak WITH them. Email me amy@gethybridsocial.com\n  \n  \n",
