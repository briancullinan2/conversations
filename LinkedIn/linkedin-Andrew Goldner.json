As a CFO I have very high expectations on what it means to be a fully-fledged member of a senior management team driving value creation for a business. Andrew was able to use his previous experiences combined with an incredible intellect and passion for learning new business models in order to spotlight those areas that would require investment and drive long-term value for the Company.  During his tenure we enjoyed not only substantial growth in our Audience business but also a shift from one-time events to more SaaS based recurring revenues.  His reach went beyond his own team and he connected with all functional areas in order to fully understand and help craft our Audience value proposition. He is a consummate professional dedicated to making his mark in whatever he pursues and I look forward to our paths crossing again in the future."
