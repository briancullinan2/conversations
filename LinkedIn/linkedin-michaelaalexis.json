My most recent LinkedIn video campaign, #letsgethonest, reached over 26 million users!***When I was in kindergarten, I ran home excitedly one day, brimming with glitter and pride, as I announced that I was \"The ONLY TOOTH FAIRY at Career Day, and everybody else in my class was just dressed up as doctors and dentists!\"​ My imaginative spirit has not changed much since that day.My name is Michaela and I'm a Marketing Specialist accidentally turned Linkedin Viral Content Creator living in Ottawa, Canada. I had my first viral hit article on Linkedin back in March 2016, and have been writing ever since. I've gone from a few hundred to 85,000+ followers in a year, garnering multiple millions of views, comments, shares, and general love from this community along the way. My articles and advice have since been published on CNBC, Success.com, Shopify, NDC News, Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, PR Daily, The Muse, Job.com, Thought Catalog, and more! When I'm not writing or brainstorming, I spend my time volunteering with The Boys and Girls Club, ONFE, and teaching Canadian newcomers how to network and maintain confidence during their job search. I love serving others, helping my connections reach their potential, and sprinkling smiles wherever and whenever I can. Oh, and coffee...drinking loads and loads of coffee!
