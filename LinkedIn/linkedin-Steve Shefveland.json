At the end of the day, outsourcing is all about the labor you are tapping into (hiring) to deliver a service, solve a problem, sell a product, or improve a service.  Outsourcing is NOT about the technology, industry verticals.  It all about the people.  Therefore, I approach outsourcing from a labor/people approach first, ensuring we have very low employee attrition (currently 15% a year) that exceeds customer expectations from markets that are not saturated with other contact centers.Deep background in Travel, Telecom (Wireless, Cable, Satellite, Broadband, IT, Consumer Services, Healthcare, Medical, Insurance and Energy (including utilities).\n  \n  \n",
