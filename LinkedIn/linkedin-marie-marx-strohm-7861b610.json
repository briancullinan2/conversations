                "Honestly, does it get any better than Debbe Hirata? I hired her to voice my precious documentary film on Canada's environmental debacle---the Alberta Tar Sands and the proposed Enbridge pipeline and subsequent tanker traffic down British Columbia's pristine, environmentally fragile coast to the sea. She studied the issue and made it her own so that when it came time to narrate the film--she just got it. Debbe is beyond my wildest dream as a writer---my words came alive and their weight and meaning were at once illuminated by this incredibly gifted voice talent and enlightened human being. Hire her. That's all I can say."
