                "Bandwango is a software company providing the travel industry with tools to increase revenue per visitor. Our software is capable of creating customized visitor passes where a customer can purchase a single pass valid at a variety of attractions (including lift tickets, on-site attractions and experiences, food/bev, lessons, rentals, etc) for a fixed price and a specified duration. This provides a customized experience for the diverse demographic of customers that destination serves. Additionally, our software allows for the sale of tickets, packages, and products using revenue management principles, including lead-time based pricing where customers willing to purchase date-specific tickets receive discounts based on when the purchase is made. Also, add-ons and spending incentives can easily be added onto these passes encouraging visitors to pre-purchase additional items and incentivize them to spend more when they arrive.Our system is built upon an API framework, which allows the software to be easily integrated into our customer's website, mobile application, or any other channel that they use to reach their target audience. This allows them to maintain their brand integrity and keep full control over the sale of their products.Finally, our passes are fully digital and mobile friendly. Customers can browse, purchase, redeem, and even share their passes via their mobile devices - iOS or Android."
