When I first met him, he was an Oracle DBA at our company, and so I assumed that his technical background was mostly in Oracle. Over time I discovered that his technology interests and competencies are much broader. He does a lot, such as leading architectural discussions on the cloud, establishing private cloud solutions, creating and presenting designs for data HA, vendor evaluation, and even weighing in on the relative merits of RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. Later I found out that he's even a math and physics geek.I mentioned vendor evaluation. One of Christian's strengths is that he is on top of what's happening in industry--technology trends, vendor offerings, and that sort of thing. He does a great job bringing that information into the company.Something that everybody likes about Christian is that he creates an environment of camaraderie. I won't try to explain it here, but everybody who knows him knows exactly what I mean. It is very pleasant to work with him. He is a very knowledgeable and yet humble leader."
