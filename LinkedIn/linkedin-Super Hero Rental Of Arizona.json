It also has a secret elevator that leads to a matching Batcave in a secret sub-basement under the building.Through the Wayne Foundation and the organizations underneath, Dark Knight not only addresses social problems encouraging crime and assists victims in a way that his Batman persona cannot, but the arrangement also provides a large network of connections in the world of charities. He finds out about the newest trends and newest arts, and at the same time maintains connections to the streets through the soup kitchens and social services groups, which augments his crime fighting efforts."
