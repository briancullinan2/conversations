                "A lot of people are talking about the #LVMPD timeline 6 minute issue .I believe the real issue with the timeline is related to MGM. The Casinos do not like to call the police department for assistance, ever! They usually handle everything internally and I would not doubt that the first calls to 911 wasn't made from the hotel. It was probably reported over the radio by police officers below and attendees of the concert far before MGM called 911 (if they ever did). So the security guard was shot, he radios Casino security, they send more security up, don't call police, guy starts breaking out windows and starts shooting the crowd, and reports to police department start occurring 6 minutes later. The exterior hotel glass isn't easy to break out. even with bullets. So it could have easily taken 6 minutes before he began shooting into the crown. Easy to explain the 6 minutes. Although make no mistake, MGM is covering their asses first and foremost!",
