A good recruiter really has to understand the personality of the hiring manager, as well as the group dynamic of the team that they're hiring into.  Lindsay is great at both.  In fact, she'll sometimes tell me that she's not sending me a candidate based solely on a lack of group fit, which is fantastic, because it means that the candidates she does send are very good matches all around.  Highly recommended her as an excellent recruiting partner!"
