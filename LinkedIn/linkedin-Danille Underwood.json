        "summary": "    I started Raise the Bar Bartending with one thing in mind. To deliver top notch customer service in an industry where it is hard to find. A bartender plays a vital role in how smoothly an event will be. Each of my bartenders go above and beyond to make sure your event goes smoothly and you are able to actually enjoy your own party! They are personable, highly trained, and tons of fun! Our bartending packages start at only $25/hr. We also carry a two million dollar liquor liability policy, and you should never serve alcohol at an event without it. You can call me anytime to book an event, learn more information, or to get a quote. :) 480-521-0449\n  \n  \n",
