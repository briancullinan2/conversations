Plus, he always has several options on how to create the magic you are looking for that will make it all work.He is also my favorite friend to run down all the latest geeky new Internet developments so I can keep up with what’s constantly changing out there in the worlds of media and technology. The breadth of his tech knowledge is so huge a lot of the time I can’t even keep up and I learn from him. Aside from all his professional skill sets, what I value most is his loyalty. Chris is very pro-active and thrives on contributing to whatever you need, and always goes more than the distance you ask him to go.It’s also really nice to work with somebody who cares more about his son than his pocketbook.

Chris is well known for taking many companies Internet and social media networking presence to amazing heights with a brilliant track record of simple and effective SEO options and strategies.  Now at first I knew nothing about such things as SEO (Search Engine Optimizations) but with lots of patience and some enthusiastic helpful coaching from Christopher I managed to come to grips with a whole new IT language, embracing marketing concepts, that I’m happy to report work a treat. True to his name and IT fame, Christopher is an expert at all things related to setting yourself up for maximisation on the Internet. He is fast and efficient with a quirky sense of humour, making me laugh at myself and the Internet at large on a regular basis, putting me at ease. With his broad knowledge, wonderful attitude and happy disposition, Christopher made my journey into the techno side of my business and the world of social media cyber space, simple. I still engage Christopher's skills as a contractor and am enjoying the outcomes he has helped deliver to my business so far.  A true professional and real team player, uplifting, patient and friendly, he listened to what my business needs really were, gently guiding me to understand a whole new world of possibilities and options with relative ease, which, I must say was no mean feat, let me tell you....  I’m so grateful for our business connection, as I love knowing that I have someone I trust to takes care of my IT end of things and who doesn’t charge unreasonable rates. I highly recommend Christopher as an IT expert to anyone who needs a professional, to help grow their Internet and social media presence. I’m currently enjoying constant growth in my social media SEO aspect of my businesses with regular ongoing support. I can now move forward confidently while Chris and I are happy working together strategizing for the rest of my business growth requirements.

I cut my teeth on LAMP with AXIS Open Source's training and learned even more just by being fortunate enough to worth with John on a variety of projects.   But beyond his incredible ability to see things in code, his abilities to take complex problems and simplify them into fast moving systems, and his insight in to consumer behavior is his personal character.   If you've known John for any period of time you quickly come to realize this is a man who gives of himself and his time to help others.  He is incredibly patient and generous.  He's the real deal.  If you're lucky enough to do business with him, leap at the opportunity."
