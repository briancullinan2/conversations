                "Rich has an uncanny sense for how to find a simple solution to complex technical problems. One of my favorite projects I've worked on at Digg is building a redundant sharded Redis cluster, and Rich turned building that complex system into a tractable and straightforward project. Rich has since moved on to leading the technical side of our Ads platform, but I still go to him frequently to run ideas past him, and for his insight when hard problems have me stumped."
