Starting first as an intern and swiftly becoming a full time employee, we were happy to facilitate his growth in the video and film production business.  Richard grew like a weed, gaining knowledge and high accolades as a P.A., climbing into the position of a graphic and 3d designer, and doing a little bit of everything from dubbing TV spots to digital file management to managing our fleet of interns.  Goal motivated, both a good leader and follower, and an overall fantastic team member, Richard gets 2 thumbs up from Spectrum Video and Film!  We look forward to seeing where he goes in the future."
