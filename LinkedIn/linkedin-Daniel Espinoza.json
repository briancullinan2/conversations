I've spent the last 10 years honing those skills at a large technology company and have participated in several leadership training courses such as Richardson Training, Dale Carnegie and certification from the Center for Leadership Studies. I have seen success in many leadership roles because I genuinely care about others and work hard to help them see the potential they have within themselves. Outside of the business world I enjoy traveling, sports, craft beer and spending time with my little pug. \n  \n  \n",
