                "It is exciting working with Micah because he thinks outside the box..  He has created numerous forward thinking inventions and is interested in making a difference. He has an extremely large toolbox of skills in mathematics and several disciplines of science and ever since I have met Micah he has focused on expanding his knowledge base.  Anyone on Micah’s team will benefit because I am certain that he is going to be associated with the development of the next generation of marketable technologies in the fields of large scale non-thermal laser ablation and geothermal power technologies."

Jon is the type of guy who is always ready to apply innovative out-of-the-box thinking to persistent problems, to break the mold, to try something new - and he has the determination and personal fortitude to see the task through to completion. He is one of the most enthusiastic personalities you will ever meet. Do you need a problem solved or an analysis performed? Jon will be the first person to offer help, and he will most certainly be the most excited to get underway. He leads, inspires and drives from this place to achieve results.I could go on about Jon, but honestly, words are paltry substitutes compared with meeting him in person. If you were thinking about talking to him or engaging with him, forget the hesitation. You'll find that Jon's drive, enthusiasm, excitement and passion are infectious."
