At the age of 22, I decided to embark on a journey to find my passion in life and leave the restaurant industry behind. I wanted to do this so that I wouldn't be 40 years old, burnt out, and drained from working jobs I simply didn't love. After doing a ton of research into career opportunities, I found myself wanting to be part of the tech industry. It's booming and always changing the world, so I explored the option of development by enrolling in a basics of web development course. I was hooked. I began spending every possible hour I could writing code. In my first week, I was creating sites from scratch. Over the next couple of months, I began building web apps and learning new languages. Once I built up my confidence, I refined my skill-set by dedicating my education and practice to JavaScript, primarily focusing on ReactJS. I am a self taught developer learning is my passion, I am extremely adaptable, and eager to break into the industry.Skills of note: React, React-Native, Angular, Redux, Javascript, CSS3, Sass\n  \n  \n",
