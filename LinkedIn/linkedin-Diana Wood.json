Diana Wood is one such person.  I worked as a professional puppeteer for Diana at the Red Cross as part of that organization's Health and Safety programming.  She single-handedly created programming which furthered the Red Cross outreach mission in ways not seen at other branches of the American Red Cross.  Instead of average in-school programming that many school children are used to, Diana worked with artists in the region to create fun and unforgettable puppet shows that embodied the crucial safety and prevention messages inherent to the Red Cross mission.  It was a pleasure to work with and for Diana Wood.  Her constant good nature and capacity to wear many hats in her job made my job that much easier.  She is capable of talking numbers (programming budgets, employee hours, insurance, mileage) one moment and crafting innovative ideas (new show ideas, creative ways to improve current shows) the next.  Employees such as Diana are key to success in the way businesses will operate in the future.  Creative, innovative thinking and problem solving combined with an inherent business sense will be key to a successful business practice.  If your company is thinking of hiring Diana Wood, DO SO!

She single-handedly created programming which furthered the Red Cross outreach mission in ways not seen at other branches of the American Red Cross.  Instead of average in-school programming that many school children are used to, Diana worked with artists in the region to create fun and unforgettable puppet shows that embodied the crucial safety and prevention messages inherent to the Red Cross mission.  It was a pleasure to work with and for Diana Wood.  Her constant good nature and capacity to wear many hats in her job made my job that much easier.  She is capable of talking numbers (programming budgets, employee hours, insurance, mileage) one moment and crafting innovative ideas (new show ideas, creative ways to improve current shows) the next.  Employees such as Diana are key to success in the way businesses will operate in the future.  Creative, innovative thinking and problem solving combined with an inherent business sense will be key to a successful business practice.  If your company is thinking of hiring Diana Wood, DO SO!  She is wonderful to work with and I have learned so much from her in my years of working with her.  Thank you,Amy BogardCincinnati, Ohio"
