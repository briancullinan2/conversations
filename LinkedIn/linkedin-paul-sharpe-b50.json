In particular, my focus was on the metrics backend services (Cuckoo, Nuthatch), the Lucene-based distributed log indexing service (LogLens), the tracing service (Zipkin), the service that tracks deployed SHAs (DeployDB), and Twitter’s artifact storage service (Packer).Responsibilities included service architecture, roadmap planning, mentorship, as well as day-to-day operations and development work. Previous to Service Diagnostics, I was the tech lead for the Continuous Integration team in Twitter's Engineering Effectiveness org. Responsible for the Jenkins infrastructure, as well as the existing distributed unit test execution service. Designed and prototyped multiple versions of its replacement, including a Jenkins-on-Mesos solution, and a Go-based distributed service capable of running unit tests and other build tasks.Previous to EE, I was in the SRE organization where I lead a cross-team group working on a custom, Ansible-based automation framework for handling complex workflows (such as kernel upgrades) across the fleet. I was also a founding member of the Tools & Automation team, responsible for the direction of software projects as well as development standards within the SRE org."
