One of his strengths is his attention to detail for systems as a whole. He has an affinity for application performance, coding standards, best practices, and efficiency. I consider him to be one of the greatest allies on projects we've worked together on, as well as an incredible mind to pique while working through difficult problems. Moe's biggest draw is that he's platform, framework, and language agnostic. He has a true analytical mindset, and can work well with any project requirements.

I was studying English, and decided a lifetime of working in the food service industry wasn't what I wanted. So I cracked books, Good Will Hunting style, and here I am now. How do you like them apples? #NoStudentLoansI think the biggest mistake I ever made was thinking I absolutely needed a degree. If this statement bothers you, kindly move on.I spend a lot of time in the gym, and I'm also into cooking food (and eating it), going hiking, taking dance classes, working, reading books, and listening to audiobooks. I tend to love everything I do and I'm never bored.Personal growth and ambition are both important to me. This decade, my thirties, is dedicated to both of those, as well as gratitude, mindfulness, professional development, and physical fitness.I've heard that there are only two problems: 1) you know what you want but you don't know how to get it, and 2) you don't know what you want.I know what I want.\n  \n  \n",
