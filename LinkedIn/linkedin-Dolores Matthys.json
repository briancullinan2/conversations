Sandy had our back, we ran rogue and we made great shit. The OG Stefan Janoski shoe would never have happened but we had a small team and made the change (after a sample being in a catalog.) That was the seed necessary to begin a franchise that's rolling to this day. Also, happy Wu Wednesday.",

The nursery required vigilant attention to detail and the care of as many as 100 kittens at any given time. Her work was immaculate, records were always strictly kept which was imperative in our work. Her love for the animals most certainly cannot be questioned as every decision she made, it was based on what was best for the animal. Dolores worked the overnight shift with minimal supervision, showing great self motivation and problem solving skills. Since our time at the Nursery together, I have watched and supported Dolores in her rescue efforts, focusing on holistic care and senior shelter dogs. Dolores is a great employee with a great heart!"

The nursery required vigilant attention to detail and the care of as many as 100 kittens at any given time. Her work was immaculate, records were always strictly kept which was imperative in our work. Her love for the animals most certainly cannot be questioned as every decision she made, it was based on what was best for the animal. Dolores worked the overnight shift with minimal supervision, showing great self motivation and problem solving skills. Since our time at the Nursery together, I have watched and supported Dolores in her rescue efforts, focusing on holistic care and senior shelter dogs. Dolores is a great employee with a great heart!"

        "summary": "    “Where your talents and the needs of the world cross; there lies your vocation.” ― AristotleAlways ready and looking for meaningful, creative and stimulating employment in the Portland, Willamette Valley, Bend area or a remote opportunity.  Main areas of interest: Sustainability/ organics, craft brewing (beer/ cider), design, and animal welfare.What I learned about me over the years...I draw outside the lines, stray off the beaten path, ask questions, challenge the labeled boxes, think spatially, re-invent and create processes, analyze and re-analyze, find the needle in the haystack, get awestruck by up-cycled & recycled design, am a hopeful home-brewer, photographer of homeless pets, recipe bending chef for my pampered pets,...and passionate about what I respect and value in life.I grew  and learned from wonderful mentors during my corporate Nike career, but then came a time where those close to me needed my focus and time. This allowed me to change gears and pursue my passion for animals. As I learn what makes me tick, I explore what skills to develop and ways to enhance my purpose on this journey, wherever it may lead next.\n  \n  \n",
