He was able to facilitate new processes, invest in and empower his people, and make the difficult decisions to get us back on track for success. He truly knows what it takes to create new exciting products and stay ahead of the curve in such a challenging field. It's been a privilege to work for Anthony, and I hope to again in the future."
