Jim is the facilitator of this group.  His style is relaxed but focused.   He has the uncanny ability to understand all of us as individuals while still keeping us a cohesive group.  Leaving these meetings I don’t come back with ‘notes’ on concepts, but rather action items that I can put into place immediately impacting my performance.  Jim’s influence on our group helps us all to improve, see our short comings and know how to address them.  While this is going on, Jim never loses focus the roll our personal life plays in our business performance.
