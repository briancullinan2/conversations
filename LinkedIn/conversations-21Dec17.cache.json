I felt the same way about various fields of science, but I couldn't pick just one and dive deep into it, I felt like I'd be missing out in other areas, and going back to school wasn't an option. That's how my side project was born. Now, I am working on changing the way scientific research is funded and the way the public is informed about where their donations go when they give to large charity organizations. There is a lot of money falling through the cracks that could be used to launch new research projects. I'm working with a team at TGen in Phoenix to test viability of the model before I start building a platform to scale it. I get to work with the scientist to understand what they're working on. I even got a tour of the lab! It's fascinating. \n\nSOS Method looks interesting, and what a great application of VR technology- using it for meditation. Makes perfect sense. I've been trying to launch a mixed reality project for Alliance (the company I currently work for full time) for roughly a year, but Alliance is a real estate development and management company, so everything is very traditional and slow moving. Drives me crazy.\n\nWhat side of town are you on? Maybe we could meet for coffee and talk in more detail?",

It also plays well with Martini's and Belvedere happens to be my vodka of choice so we are now best of friends and you can tell your wife :) I do not have a CTO for my business as I am in the funding stages with an investor I have worked with in the past. I would be curious to know if you are listed on Angel.co and if you have worked on other startups and what your role was. What are you doing now? Happy that you found me on LinkedIn and it appears we are both in AZ. So, perhaps we will have to do a quick zoom video call to intro with each other and see if we might be a fit in the near future. This is a timely opportunity as I am meeting with the investor next week. Let me know if you care to set up a 30 min virtual zoom call.",

Might reduce theft from an executive's perspective, but from the bartender perspective it gives them creative freedom to pour however they want without being confined to ounces. Drinking alcohol could be more interactive than just ordering a generic lemon drop and handing out shots. The bar could act like a stock market where after a certain amount is consumed it crashes and drinks are really cheap. I am on angel.co call me anytime 4804660856.",

All of these have places they excel in. Unity3D is well supported and easy to build in, but can't handle large worlds well; a phone based VR system is very portable and easy to bring with you for ease of jus hopping in, but lack the comfort of something like the Vive; releasing on Steam gives. So I would try to limit the scope of reach for your prototype. The lowest common denominator for easy of testing is Unity3D and a Google Cardboard viewer. You can work with the atmosphere and get the feel right before diving into interface design.",

My perm team works quite a bit with Java roles, but on the contract/C2H side I see more .NET stuff.\n\nI enjoy the bleeding edge JS technology stuff -- Angular, React, Redux - functional programming, etc. Now THAT stuff is fun!",
