                "My Son-in-law TJ received his Bachelors Degree and I feel compelled to mention it. He is a Veteran, father of 6, worked full time, and farmed to get through college.  He used his veteran benefits and a lot of hard work to make it happen. But he is too humble to mention it or even walk down the isle. Over the weekend he just pulled out his diploma from the mailing tube to show me. He laughed that I was so excited. He didn't know others would understand the importance and struggle it takes to get a degree as a returning adult veteran. (I do).  Please feel free to like this post so I can show him others appreciate what he accomplished.  Way to go TJ!",
