        "summary": "    Dedicated to success, with 15 years experience in business development, training, customer service, marketing and sales. Since graduating with a bachelors in International Affairs and a AA in Business studies, I accepted a year contract with commercial director Michael Sugrue to assist with sales and business development. I then decided to lean towards marketing and took a position which allowed me to travel all over the US, working for a marketing firm where I assisted in executing national campaigns for a fortune 100 companies. I was then approached by an emerging medical aesthetic device company. I started in Inside Sales and was promoted within a year to Miami as a Advanced SkinCare and Pharmaceutical Territory Manager. After many quick successes, I became the acting Regional Business Manager for Suneva's 5 Yr Dermal Filler for the Southern Florida and Puerto Rico Territory. I had the pleasure of working with some of the top Plastic Surgeons and Cosmetic Derms in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Puerto Rico and loved almost every minute of it. Wanting to move closer to Family, I then accepted a position as the Practice Manager at Synergy Medical Aesthetics & Wellness. I love working one on one with patients and finding ways to work with our local community, however I once had completed that contract, I knew that Houston wasn’t the right fit. Now that I am back home (California), I am excited to announce that I accepted a position as the Southern California Director of Provider Solutions for PatientPoint! Please reach out if you are interested in award winning patient education that makes the Doc-Patient engagement experience better. - Shaura714-317-0920\n  \n  \n",
