                "Naomi took a chance hiring me as the copy editor at VitalWare, and I am so glad she did. Being a part of her team was truly an incredible experience. She allowed me to hone my skills every day, and pushed me to be the best I could be in my job. Naomi is a great leader. Her team doubled in size in only six months, and she handled the transition incredibly well. There was never a day that went by that she didn't reach out to me to help with my work or make sure things were going alright. I started my time at VitalWare with little experience in anything other than copy editing, and in less than a year, Naomi helped me expand my skill set exponentially. I can't stress enough how much she improved VitalWare's marketing in just a year, and I know she will continue to do amazing things in the future."
