        "summary": "    Let's connect: jeff@jeffmagill.netTechnology is in my blood. I've been around it since I was a young child. My first computer was a TI-99/4A connected to a black and white tube television. That was the first computer I ever wrote code on. As a young teen, I worked on IBM mainframes fixing hardware and installing operating systems and configuring applications. The same goes for AT&T PBX systems and then the early PC-based telephony systems.Ultimately I went into finance for my first career, but in every position I've gravitated towards technology, from working on hardware to implementing systems. As such, my move into software development is a natural transition.To me, software development is an intellectual and creative endeavor. It's problem solving on many levels, from application architecture, to solving the business problem at hand, to UI/UX. And the solutions for every layer of the application are simultaneously creative in their own ways. It gets my brain going.But I also have soft skills. I can work with management teams at any level. I can help clients think through their business needs and develop solutions. I can handle difficult situations, manage projects, and talk in front of hundreds of people and keep their attention.I guess you could say I'm a problem solver, a solution finder. My tool of choice just happens to be software.LANGUAGES: C# • JavaScript • TypeScript • JSON • jQuery • HTML • CSSDATABASES: MS SQL Server • MySQLFRAMEWORKS: ASP.NET Core • Angular • Windows MobileTOOLS: Visual Studio • VS Code • Git/GitHub • TFSOTHER: Object Oriented Programming • Design Patterns and Principles • Data Structures • Agile/Scrum •  SDLCCODE SAMPLEShttps://github.com/jeffmagilldotnet\n  \n  \n",
