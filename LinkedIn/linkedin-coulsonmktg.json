He can be discreet and can blend in with delegates at larger conferences, or switch to create a fun and relaxed environment when taking portraits.  We recently used Mike for brochure portrait shots prior to our European Conference.  He put his subjects at ease, made an ordinary office environment eye catching, and managed to use the available light to turn a dull winter morning into what appeared, in the final shots, to be a bright sunny day. Most importantly he’s very handy with the Photoshop. Crows feet, bags under the eyes and grey hairs removed on request.  Highly recommended and good graphic designer to boot."

I worked closely with Simon for three years at Swiftpage as he progressed into several product and commercial roles. Simon is effective, measured and logical. He has a commercial mind-set, combined with technical knowledge and an output driven focus that resulted in the delivery of effective projects that progressed our business and made us more competitive.Whilst I headed up the marketing operations function, Simon seamlessly transitioned into several product and commercial roles to fit the businesses evolving needs. Each role retained close ties with the marketing operations team, who relied and valued Simon as a standout performer.  He is a careful listener and a quick learner. He is a concise communicator, has a calm head and dry wit and builds strong relationships with colleagues and channel partners. He can turn theory and considered planning into action and results.
