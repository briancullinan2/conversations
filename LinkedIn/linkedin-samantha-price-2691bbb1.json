        "summary": "    Recent Graduate from Arizona State University with a B.S. in Supply Chain Management from the W.P. Carey School of Business.From my experience as a production planner I learned the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system SAP. Within SAP I placed purchase orders and resupply orders, this also required communicating directly with the co-manufacturers. I also gained the tools to recognize ambiguous data to generate a forecast bias for SKU’s with high demand variability. I was exposed into the cross functional nature of supply chain and team collaboration across the whole value chain. As an operations excellence leader I got to learn another side of supply chain.  I worked directly in the manufacturing facility and main distribution center, participating in lean manufacturing, strategic planning, and overall equipment efficiency. My main focus was on continuous improvement with new and updated standardized operation procedures and the 5’s methodology. I believe in using the skills and experience I have gained throughout my studies and internships to grow with a company and become a great supply chain leader. As an employee, I strive to be a team contributor and an independent worker in order to communicate effectively, make a difference in the workplace around me, and become a great asset to any company.\n  \n  \n",
