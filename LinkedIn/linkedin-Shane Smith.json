While looking for online resources to further develop my IT skills and explore new technologies, I found A Cloud Guru and Linux Academy. What a great discovery! I've learned a lot in the past weeks, and more importantly, having heaps of fun! Today AWS is just a hobby, however, I'm excited to follow my journey, I'm very hungry to learn more.",
