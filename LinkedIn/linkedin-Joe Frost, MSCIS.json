The project entailed the move of over 300 users from one location to a new location, and involved coordinating all activities as it relates to IT (servers, Desktops), Telecommunications (Voice, LAN, Wireless, WAN), Facilities (power, construction, cabling)  as well as managing the multiple vendors involved in the move. Prior to Joe coming on-board,the project was at a stand-still. Within a week of coming on-board Joe's passion and dedication quickly put the project back on-track and actually completed the project ahead of schedule.  He was particularly focused on his customers' strategic needs, ensuring all services provided by vendors met each of their respective needs, while maintaining an enthusiastic approach that ensured team participation and collaborative decisions.
