Chase made it his mission to absorb and learn as much information as he possibly could. I saw Chase quickly develop into a strong, analytic, thought driven engineer in a short amount of time. I'm very happy Chase has moved on the bigger and better things and truly do believe the sky is the limit for him.  If an employer is looking for a hardworking, dedicated,  individual with the ability to learn new skills, Chase is your guy."

Zac was always extremely professional to work with and always made the clients feel at ease. He has an amazing ability to bridge the gap between technology and client management. When I eventually made the career change into CRM and joined his team, Zac went out of his way to make sure that I was trained properly. Zac has the uncanny ability to see big picture, even when the people around him do not. His experience with Business Development is almost unrivaled in the current market. While acting as my mentor, I was constantly blown away by his ability to remember the small personal details of everyone he encountered, making it easy for him to call anyone a friend. I would recommend Zac for any management, business development, sales, or client management position."
