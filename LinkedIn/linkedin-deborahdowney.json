        "summary": "    I enjoy working for organizations that promote values I am deeply committed to--Civic Responsibility, Quality Learning Opportunities, Personal and Professional Growth, and Excellence in Community Achievement. I am passionate about sharing my knowledge to help others succeed, whether training employees, students, or community outreach. I have had the ability to display my ability in the classroom as an instructor at Metropolitan Community college teaching; Human Relation, Multicultural Issues, Marriage and the Family, and Introduction to Sociology. I believe in intelligent, common sense management, and I look forward to having the ability to educate with enthusiasm and fervor to serve an organization, and help them grow their business from the inside out. Excellent employees can make a business great.  In my spare time  I adore carpentry, and finishing work. You'd be amazed at the beauty these two hands can create. Artistry is truly intelligence on display!\n  \n  \n",
