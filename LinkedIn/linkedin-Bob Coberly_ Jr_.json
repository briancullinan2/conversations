        "summary": "    Through the years as a real estate professional and later as an investor, I developed a strong sense of how to add value and increase revenue on assets that have a cash flow component to their description.  To take that cash flow and put a simple capitalization rate multiple in order to determine the valuation of the asset, does a disservice to the portfolio.  I believe in building investment models that take into account external factors that enhance an assets value or in creating such an external factor for the same result.  This knowledge is not something that can be taught in school, learned through advising clients as a broker and/or consultant, this knowledge comes from being a principle in a company, personally guaranteeing equity and debt.  In today's world, we need to minimize risk exposure and maximize income potential.  This risk/reward paradigm is something that I believe can be hedged in all facets of business.\n  \n  \n",
