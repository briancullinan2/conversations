The simultaneous opening of BASIS Independent Silicon Valley, and BASIS Independent Brooklyn is unprecedented in American private k - 12 education.

These new independent schools will offer a world quality learning experience at an exceptional value to families in high-cost metropolitan cities.These schools offer a STEM-focused liberal arts curriculum, giving students the tools they need to excel in the 21st century. Passionate subject experts challenge their students with high expectations whilst providing the highest levels of support. The school culture is entirely focused on student learning, above all on educating students so that by graduation they have come to a deep understanding of their passions and are able to make choices that might otherwise, in a traditional private school or public magnet school, be closed to them. Our commitment  to our parents is that their children will be inspired to become the best version of themselves."
