Hit me up if you want a one pager of the strains, pricing and terms.¬† Cheers, Matt",

        "summary": "    The show is based on Life! My life and the Unique people and places I find in my weekly travels. The idea behind the show is to get people of all walks of life to tell their inspiring stories. How do we get these people to open up you might ask? We take them along for a Glamping trip and adventure of a lifetime! Ever seen those huge trailers on the freeway? Yep we have one! A huge 40 foot triple slide out 5th wheel! So back to the show... So imagine we are all set up sitting around the camp fire... Everyone is enjoying their nights ( some may have a beer... myself I am a cannabis patient) talking about life (Here are chances to review products. I plan on having natural conversations about the products that we give to everyone beginning of the trip). We film 24/7. The next morning everyone wakes to the KAOS of the race car flying thru camp! ENGINE REVING! Time to have some fun! I then take our guest for a ride along in Cockeyed the race car ( He is a class 5 off-road race car with a huge engine 300hp Chevy v6! with huge shocks. Oh and he is a 1969 bug and street legal!). We use open face helmets to ensure we can see the faces of our guests and driver alike. We will get video of the shocks and tires working like crazy as we go over every bump at 100mph. That's not enough! We will get chase footage from above  with a drone. Footage from ground with stationary cameras and people placed along the path with cameras ready to catch all the action. WELCOME TO COCKEYED!!!!!\n  \n  \n",
