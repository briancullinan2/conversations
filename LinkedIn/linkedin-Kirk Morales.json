His ambition and drive for not just good but great software design was evident, which helped set the tone for how the development process would go.  The tools and internal-testing/process-control Kirk put in place carried through after he left, as stable and logical methods of managing the software development life cycle.Kirk is absolutely in innovator in software technology and is able to solve complex situations using any number of programming languages.  I have learned a lot from him and he has inspired me in the software design and development area."

He is clearly very skilled at technology where he quickly understands and then solves the problem with programming wizardry but after talking through business strategy an entrepreneurial and creative spirit is clearly in his DNA. Take a second and look at his photography work and you can clearly see he is not your typical technology person. He has taken exciting risks over the past year with the launch of his new business intrakr that I am honored to now be an advisor in. I am very excited to watch his evolution!"
