Recently (2008) we had the opportunity to work on a data management project together for the college. The project required his understanding of Microsoft Excel and Raiser's Edge as well as the actual data itself. He understood all three competently. He was very easy to work with, could understand the \"bigger\" picture when it came to the tasks necessary to perform, and was very accurate when working with the data. Never a bad word was uttered from any of my fellow colleagues about him. He engaged with the college's employees with professionalism and a sense of reverent human dignity that, even in informal settings like luncheons and off campus celebrations, made one feel good about one's self after conversing with him. His native intelligence and gentle, calculated demeanor make for a highly desirable employee; one who will strengthen and improve not only the professional operations, but also the social dynamic of any company, for profit or not."
