        "summary": "    I'm an ecommerce entrepreneur and am currently building a network of \"Product Specific\" Keyword eCatalogs selling promotional logo corporate gifts and event giveaways.  LOGOpremiums.com is my first eCatalog selling all kinds of discount logo gifts, promotional products and trade show event giveaways.  LogoFlashlights.com is my newest eCatalog.  LOGOpremiums.com has become a successful e-business rating high in many organic keyword Google searches.  I feel combining Keyword Domains with relevant content and consumer friendly website design will help our Keyword eCatalog rate organically on the first page of searches for the products we sell.  \"Product Specific\" eCatalogs will separate us from our competition.I own many keyword specific domain names including LogoTshirts.com, LogoPolo.com, LogoSweatShirt.com, LogoBaseballCaps.com, LogoCups.com, and more.   My goal is to build these individual product specific website eCatalogs and link to LOGOpremiums.com creating an organic network of over ten \"Product Specific\" eCatalogs selling discount promotional marketing logo products and corporate business gifts.  I look forward to becoming a significant player in the multi-billion dollar promotional marketing industry through the development of my micro-marketing eCatalog network.Specialties:- Internet Entrepreneur- New e-business development- SEO management- Promotional marketing- Custom product design and manufacturing in USA and overseas.- Direct importer and exporter of standard promotional products and logo gifts.- Exclusive 3D hologram design and manufacturing (made in USA).- Creating eye catching interactive 3-D direct marketing mailers & packaging.- Project management and client service.- Creative Director.- Creative Inventor.- Creative Problem Solver\n  \n  \n",
