Building a computer repair software to help both IT professionals and consumers save hours of time repairing malware infected computers by automating the process. www.pctechmate.com is the first of several products to leave our stables.I am a small business owner,  a civic leader and a board member of the Habitat for Humanity. Connecting the dots, making order out of chaos, and finding a way forward to succeed (direct from James Colgan)Short version: Serial startup guy (3 so far). Live in the greatest place in the world!. Long Version: Was a yacht captain in the Eastern Caribbean for several years and moved back stateside to be closer to my son. There weren't very many yachts to drive up here so I opened a computer repair store. During the first 18 months we created a checklist of what we would do to repair our customers' virus ridden computers. We then built a software that would automate that process. It really worked, and www.pctechmate.com was born. We are modernizing computer repair.\n  \n  \n",
