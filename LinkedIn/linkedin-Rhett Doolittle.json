She had less experience than the other people interviewing for the position, but I had a feeling about her. That turned out to be one of the best decisions of my career. Over the next 7 years she was consistently a top performer and was promoted several times. Every time she took on a new unfamiliar role, she attacked it with a vengeance. She was a critical piece to the results of my first company, which reached as high as #18 on the Inc 500's Fastest Growing Companies in the United States with a 3-year growth rate of 8,417%. It was an easy decision for us to offer her a position at our next company and she moved to Austin, TX for us. Again, that was a new role for her, new technology for the company and a new sales strategy fro the entire organization. She excelled again. We sold those companies in 2014 and I offered her a position at my new company Bluume (www.bluume.com). She was key in helping me launch my new company and it was a sad day when we lost her. I would hire her again if she wanted to move back to Arizona, so it's easy to recommend her to any company looking for a top performer. In the 7 years I worked with her she excelled in sales, sales management, sales support, customer support and different operational roles. Even if she's taking on a completely new industry or role, she'll be a top performer by her hard work, determination and ability to get better quickly from being extremely coachable."
