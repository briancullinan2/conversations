He always fights for the user and is sure to make metrics informed decisions on any designs he creates. His user journeys are very well thought out and created with attention to detail. As far as working with Jordan on a day to day basis I can't say enough good things. Jordan works very well with anyone, no matter level, title, or disposition. Jordan knows how to speak and guide developers to a final vison for a design and can incorporate feedback flawlessly. Jordan is also amazing at thinking of the angles and edge cases that comes with creating a wonderful user experience that delights and is tailored to individual users. Jordan is a knowledgable and wonderful addition to any team and if I could always work with him in any job I went to I would."

                "For more than 4.5 years working with Jordan, I have witnessed how he has developed into a skilled designer and problem-solver. He started off with a strong foundation in design and has continually improved in that area by learning new skills, software, and prototyping tools. Additionally, he has learned to code, which has elevated his prototyping skills to a serious professional level.  In addition to designing and developing, Jordan has improved his interpersonal skills to engage in the problem-solving process and effectively communicate his ideas with colleagues, managers, and executives. He collaborates effectively and is an excellent teammate. Jordan is committed to the providing superior user experiences, mainly by adhering to established best practices in design, as well as championing UX Research to inform the iterative design process. My team and I have conducted nearly a hundred UX research activities with the products for which Jordan is responsible. Jordan is so adept with UX Research methodologies that the study design planning is expedited when he participates. Jordan values seeing how users interact with the designs because he is able to recognize the trends where the design could be improve and starts generating solutions before all the sessions are completed. Furthermore, Jordan is a valued member of his team as well as extended product and research teams within the organization. In addition to being a consummate professional, Jordan is personable in an understated way and has an excellent sense of humor. Jordan is a tremendous asset to our organization. I thoroughly enjoy working with him and immensely respect his work."
