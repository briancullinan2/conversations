Curiously I clicked on the link he provided with his email which took me to his portfolio of work, and what a portfolio it is.Rarely to do you come across someone with the deep experience and incredible talent of Zo, and when  you do, you reach out and grab it with both hands and that is what we did.Zo became a consulting creative director on MotoGP - Championship Quest. This is a mobile game based on the pinnacle of motorcycle racing and our abilities to nail the look and feel of the UI had been stretched, we hoped Zo would be able to bring some magic to the game.His process of iteration, collaboration and inclusion were the panacea we had been looking for. He absolutely nailed it. He listened, he questioned and he pushed back where he felt we were off track. The result we think is some of the best work we will publish and Zo has left his stamp on another game which we hope will make it to the top charts.I could not recommend Zo more highly and I know we will be working with him again.If you are contemplating working with Zo, do yourself a favor and pull the trigger."
