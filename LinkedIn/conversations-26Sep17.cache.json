I love Axosoft... it's a great place to spend my time before I apply to college next year (I decided to take 3 gap years, which would make me 18 when I attend).\nNowadays, they cater Mondays and Wednesdays; just out of curiosity, how'd you know about Free Lunch Fridays (did you use to work there)?\nWhat are you up to these days (how's StudySauce)?\nBy the way, sorry for the delayed reply; I was out of town until last night.",

Everything at dynamynd look accurate and not too padded? ;) I use to go to FLF, heard about from another CEO friend. Got laid off from study sauce. Schools move too slow for startups so he's putting it on the back burner. No hard feelings, just a little annoyed I have to apply for jobs now. 3 gaps years sounds amazing. If this is what you want to do it is just as good as a high school experience. You're ahead of your time! I am trying not to rush in to any jobs. Interviews would be fun though. I had this idea to write a script and form a few different versions of a cover letter and manage my network on linked in using automation and IBM LanguageAlchemy. I would probably apply to 1000 places. We'll see. Glad you like axosoft, the chief there is awesome.",

IT administration setting up computers, servers, domains, etc. And finally computer security, I'm aware of a lot of the tools that are used, nmap, PCI compliance, etc. I love to do little IoT tasks, and would love to work on robots. I would do contracts, I'd prefer probably 6 months or longer. Compensation would be around mid to senior level developer since I've been at this so long. Thank you for taking the time!

Without sounding too unfocused I have 3 main areas I have really honed my skills (pending certifications). Software development in mobile and web, front end user experience. IT administration setting up computers, servers, domains, etc. And finally computer security, I'm aware of a lot of the tools that are used, nmap, PCI compliance, etc. I love to do little IoT tasks, and would love to work on robots. I would do contracts, I'd prefer probably 6 months or longer. Compensation would be around mid to senior level developer since I've been at this so long. Thank you for taking the time! Hope to hear back soon :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView in Recruiter<https://www.linkedin.com/e/v2?e=tq3iw-itkb3x5f-y6&a=cap-comm-display-inbox-item&midToken=AQEJ-d3BaS29Zw&ek=inmail_reply&id=I6186219329042862080_1000>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are receiving InMail/Open Profile notification emails.
