        "summary": "    26 years' Management of Design/Build, Construction, Building Materials Engineering and Leadership of many high-profile projects.  With formal education in Construction Technology & Engineering/Construction Management, my project experience includes being Director of Infrastructure for $300 million of the total $637 million \"New Soldier Field\" for the NFL's Chicago Bears, more than $85 million of additions and renovations to Chicago's renowned John G. Shedd Aquarium, Co-Management of Construction for the $20 million 'The Living Coast' exhibits, shop, restaurants, and banquet hall at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo.  Within a more than $200 million Program Management contract, managed new construction and modernizations/renovations of nine (9) schools in the Chicago Public School System.  As one of three Individuals selected to a team, was sent to perform, develop and present a complete \"Best use of $200 million\" 'Architectural/Engineering/Construction Needs Study' for the entire 90210 Beverly Hills, CA School District.  On the front end of AECOM's dual-government contract with the United States' and Great Britain's respective \"National Science Foundations\", developed the Master Project Schedule for our Design/Build of a super-futuristic structure in Antarctica from which both countries now work together and continue long-running research programs of the climate in Antarctica, as well as Solar System/Astronomy studies more easily done from the near-constant darkness and ideally-clear skies of Antarctica.  The building is occupied by American and British scientists who work in collaboration.  Managed design and construction of a $24 million movie theater in Chicago for Sony/Loews Cinemas, a YMCA for almost $7 million, and was Project Director on a massive and highly complex corporate campus-wide project for pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc.
