He has essentially developed our entire quality system from scratch to a point where our system is now FDA Compliant. Scott did a masterful job learning our business and tailoring the quality system to meet our specific needs. He trained our staff and continues to help us improve our system as we grow and learn.  Scott is knowledgeable, efficient, and responsive. He is a pleasure to work with and always willing to help.  We are fortunate to have Scott as part of our Quality Control team. I highly recommend Scott Pletzer to anyone that needs Quality System related support."
