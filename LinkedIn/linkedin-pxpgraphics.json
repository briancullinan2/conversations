Designed a framework for displaying and producing a myriad of styles and variants for each of our content types.• Architected an internal UI components SDK to allow for our team to quickly produce our high quality content defined by our branding style guide. Including, but not limited to, immutable and efficient control, image, font and color APIs. • Methodically pairing our Core Data models with Swift structs to allow for performant, immutable, thread-safe mirroring.• Implemented caching patterns to handle efficient Objc-Swift interoperability, which allows for models to be shared a between an innovative and legacy code base. • Designed an analytics API which incorporates a factory and strategy pattern to provide an abstract interface to be utilized throughout our code, by allowing each concrete instance to define its own implementation according to business constraints."

We accomplish this with skills in both technical and creative fields, we approach design as artists who have the ability to develop high quality, well-functioning projects. Our passion for design is behind our philosophy: \"Design is beautiful, elegant, and attractive. Most great companies have at least one thing in common: a great understanding of design and utilizing it to its capacity. The styles of the recent years are constantly updating and evolving. Companies need to adapt fast to the trends that are forming around them. The tradition methods of advertising and design are outdated and inefficient, and companies should have an option to progress; and that's what we're here for.\""
