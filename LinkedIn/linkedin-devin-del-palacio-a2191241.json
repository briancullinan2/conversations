Because of the success of the original Galileo Ambassadors program, JPL missions exploring Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Asteroids, Comets, Earth, the Sun and the Universe now come together to expand the program's scope to the Solar System and beyond.The Solar System Ambassadors Program is sponsored by the JET PROPULSION LABORATORY in Pasadena, CA, an operating division of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and a lead research and development center for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."

That success continued in 2013 as Devin served as a community organizer throughout South Phoenix & West Phoenix working to increase civic engagement in communities of color. In 2014, Devin ran for a seat on the Tolleson Union High School District Governing Board. In which Devin won his election and was voted Vice President by his fellow board members. In his first 120 days of being in office, Devin championed President Obama’s My Brothers Keeper initiative which focused on changing the life outcomes for males of color.

The Males of Color Pledge works to increase graduation rates, reduce suspension rates, and decreases high school drop out rates among Latino and African American boys. In addition to serving as a school board member; Devin was also elected in 2015 to serve as the Regional Pacific Director for the National Black Council of school board members.
