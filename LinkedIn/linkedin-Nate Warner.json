        "summary": "    Over time I have become more familiar with where my passions really are. I love writing code, solving complex problems that push my abilities, and making things work in amazing ways. My trouble has been finding where I'd like to focus those passions. I've had tremendous opportunities to develop my skills and explore what I would like to do for a career. At this point, I am using my existing development skill set with a focus towards application and end-user security.The security of our internet, our devices, and our privacy is at risk from many directions. We, as a society, need bright minds working on this frontier. I feel personally impacted and invested in solving the issues that we face. If you are directly involved with solving these problems, I would be interested in having a cup of coffee and a conversation.\n  \n  \n",
