The founders of 33 North Partners have extensive experience with early stage companies, and have been operators, investors, and board members, with multiple successful exits between them. They are not simply consultants, but through launching their own companies have directly experienced the successes and pitfalls of building a going concern.Ms. Holmes founded 33 North Partners on the principal that young technology companies often don’t have access to experienced advisors or mentors who have successfully started and exited a company, or direct access to capital sources. Ms. Holmes brings her strong ability to distill a strategic vision for young companies and her broad range of marketing experience to 33 North Partners. In combination with her co-founders, 33 North Partners solves these issues by guiding companies through areas such as their exit strategy, fundable company strategy, and capitalization strategy.  She brings a unique combination of creativity and experience to this role that is highly effective in helping early companies to becoming going concerns, and has personally engaged in raising over $3m in private capital for her partner companies."
