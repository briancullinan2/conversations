We worked together closely on several occasions and he was always eager to help.  I have only ever known Taras to go above and beyond, from the simplest request up to highly complex projects.  It was a pleasure working with someone with such deep knowledge of things like database quirks and query optimization, but who could also see the business value of data, make good recommendations, balance tradeoffs, and consider the big picture.I'd hire or work with Taras again anywhere, at any time."
