                "I had the pleasure of working with Nate during my time as a manager with University of Phoenix. Nate and I were promoted to management around the same time and we managed teams who worked together. When we started, our teams struggled to work together and even struggled to like each other - which seriously impeded their work. Due to his creativity, his positive outlook and excellent example, his team began to come around and proactively work with mine. It was so refreshing to work with someone who is such a great team player and all around enjoyable person to be around! I highly recommend Nate for any leadership position as is he is an asset to any organization."

As a colleague, Shila was always willing to assist students and my staff - regardless of whether or not she was busy. As a Supervisor, I recognized Shila's desire for knowledge and her proactive approach to professional development. It is rare to find an individual with a concrete understanding and care for her company as well as a strong commitment to her clients/students. She is a genuine, kind and intelligent woman - an asset to any organization and I am proud to recommend Shila Tavakkol."
