It is the oldest and largest wild horse and burro organization in the United States. As a volunteer I helped maintain and run a working stable that adopted wild and abused Mustangs and Burros. I learned proper techniques of horse care, with an emphasis on creating a safe environment for the animals. Was trained in aspects of all components of ecosystem management, wild horse and burro behavior, biological needs, impact derived from the range ecosystem, and transformation from range habitat to domestic care. Participated in various excursions relocating wild horses from government land to the I.S.P.M.B. stables. I took part in one of the largest relocation efforts the organization has had to date, in which a large herd of mustangs was moved from the White Sands Missile Base in New Mexico to the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota."
