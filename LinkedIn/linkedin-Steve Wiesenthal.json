I observed him progressively move up in both knowledge and responsibility from technical writing, to analyst, to being the product owner of the company's flagship product.Reflecting on his successes there from a 3rd-party point-of-view, while I can expand upon his command of Product Management as a discipline, successful buy-in and implementation of agile methodologies, or certifications/achievements earned - I would say that these only played a small role in his success. It really comes down to the fact that he possesses the right mix of characteristics and personality traits that are not only invaluable to the world of Product Management, but is often desired of candidates for any career path.Domain Knowledge (no pun intended) - When first promoted to the flagship product, Steve mentioned that he can't be successful if he does not wholly understand the product from soup to nuts. Talking abstractly about \"domains\" didn't make him a good product manager - but investing the time in learning it from the business level all the way down to the code stack is what not only made him an SME, but earn the respect of the development team. Adaptable - When one is given a directive to make order out of chaos, they must be adaptable. Steve has an innate ability to understand the \"lay of the land\", read people, and cut through ambiguity to deliver (which he did on a fairly frequent basis).Team Player - this is a huge attribute of Steve's. He worked hard to gain the respect of the development team, peers, other departments, executives, etc. He has a great ability to coalesce what different teams / individuals are seeking and formulate that into a plan.Vision - Steve also has a great ability to take the strategic vision of his product and turn that into a real, tangible roadmap to work toward.Dependability - Steve does a great job of self-managing. He is reliable and dependenable. He does not veer off on tangential items and he can always be counted on. Whenever I had a question of the state of something or requesting something - I never once had to follow-up with Steve.Communication Skills - Steve is distinctly adept at communications being capable of conversing or writing at the level of individual developers all the way to executive staff. I am certain much of this skill has grown out of his brief stint in technical writing. Moreover, his oral communication skills are fantastic and he always swung by to keep me abreast of the state of projects - even when meetings weren't called for.To summarize, Steve has a solid understanding of product management and its lesser disciplines which alone make him a viable asset for seeking companies, but I cannot stress enough that it is the set of personal characteristics he possesses that make him stand out to me above so many others."

He demonstrated a unique ability to maximize the value of each program by exhibiting a high degree of ownership, integrity, and technical ability. Jeffrey consistently leveraged his technical skills, creative and fresh thinking, and high-level of commitment, when developing and executing training programs. He has a remarkable ability to deliver both, exceptionally high-quality online learning and traditional conference-style training programs.  Jeff is highly respected by his peers and deeply valued by the organizations he works with. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work with, and learn from, such a true professional."
