We wouldn't have made this investment without Lars' involvement. His to-the-point style coupled with a bright analytical mind adds real value when you have to create internal business cases. He worked hard in getting us the most out of our investment on all levels, from training our sales force and supporting specific opportunities, to getting FRs pushed into a release. I'll work with Lars again in a heartbeat."

Add to that his experience in building out a hybrid endpoint-cloud managed solution, and you have the template for the PM of the future.I would not hesitate in hiring Miroslav again.
