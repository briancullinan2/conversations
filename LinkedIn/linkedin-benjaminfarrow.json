                "I was able to work alongside Dmitri in our newly created design team. He brought his existing knowledge of the product to good use and was a great mentor to the other designers. He was always humble and willing to learn, but never shied away with sharing the knowledge on topics that he knew. He was instrumental in the corporate and product re-branding projects. He also showed his versatility as he gained greater competence in interaction design to complement his great graphic design skills. He demonstrated his resourcefulness with sharing insights on articles he researched with other team members and instigated discussions around the principles and how we could apply them better as a team. I would gladly recommend him as a team player who will help improve the user experience."
