With a wide variety of tasks on her plate each day, Nicole always found the time to help me out when ever I needed assistance with anything. She is very knowledgeable in all aspects of recruiting, HR and employee relations.  Her approachable demeanor instantly made Nicole everyone’s “go to girl” in the office. Her strong work ethic, dedication, and outgoing personality prove that she would be a valuable asset to any organization."
