NCSA can help make sure that you do every little thing that you can to separate yourself from other recruits, which can help you earn an athletic scholarship.  We're a team of 450+ former college and professional athletes and coaches. Since 2000, we've dedicated ourselves to making the college recruiting process simpler through free recruiting tools for your sport. Beyond simply finding college athletic scholarships for students, NCSA specializes in matching college coaches with qualified student athletes, as well as proactively guiding each student-athlete and family through the recruiting process. We take the full measure of a student-athlete's potential by highlighting their athletic and academic achievements and attributes so to effectively market them to college coaches throughout the country.The recruiting process can be complicated, frustrating and completely overwhelming. It takes hard work and dedication on and off the field or court to earn an athletic scholarship. So, why in the world does NCSA want to be involved?  The simple answer is that we don’t want to see high school athletes miss out on their dreams of playing sports in college."
