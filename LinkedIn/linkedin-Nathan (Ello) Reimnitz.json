        "summary": "    Hi, I'm Nathan... I'll Provide The Solutions To Your First-World-Problems.Let’s make this as simple as possible, imagine having one dedicated consultant for everything web related. No more questioning where to go or who to talk to. No more random overseas support or stressful confusion about your website. Sound good? Well then you're in luck, I've got your back... Are you looking for help with design, development, social networking, hosting, or email setup? Let's get it done!I’ve been in the web world for 8 years and have shared successes with companies of all sizes. Throughout these years I've worked both freelance and a 'real job'​ building websites from a desk, nine-to-five... I've designed, developed, and deployed customized web-based solutions for mom-and-pop shops all the way up to multi-million dollar corporations. I've helped many small businesses grow their organic search traffic and helped corporations maintain websites with 500,000+ annual page views. No project is too big, or too small.Don't Just Take My Word For It, Listen To What My Clients Have To Say.\"Nate has been critical in the success of my website, FourLogicCars.com. Being fairly savvy with computers I thought I'd try and build a website myself when I started FourLogic. My site got 2,500 hits the first year with minimal organic traffic. Nate rebuilt my site and within the first month drove over 10,000 hits to it.My old site used to get about 10 organic hits in a good month, I'm now consistently seeing 300+ organic hits which have turned into profitable business on several occasions. The increased organic business wouldn’t have been possible without Nate’s work and SEO. In addition to this, I get numerous compliments on the layout of my new site and how easy it is to use. I would highly recommend his services to anyone looking to further develop their business or simply improve the look and feel of their website.\"  - Jared Jensen\n  \n  \n",
