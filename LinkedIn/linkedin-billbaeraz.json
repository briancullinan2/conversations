        "summary": "    After spending more than a decade as an award-winning television anchor and reporter at network affiliates around the country, including my last stop at KPHO-TV here in Phoenix, I decided in 1997 to start Baerclaw Productions, a full-service video production company in Phoenix, Arizona. The thing that I loved the most about working in television was the opportunity to share the amazing stories that are all around us. The passion to find creative ways to share these stories has only been strengthened since going out on my own, and it's what gets me up in the morning.While I still fill in at Channel 5 and Channel 3 here in Phoenix, helping my clients share their stories with the world is what makes me the happiest.Over the years, I have been the executive producer on projects for companies of all sizes from small startups to Fortune 500 companies. I have the opportunity to lead a great team made up of highly talented and driven professionals who have more than 100 years of combined video production and television experience.I have worked on every type of video project including corporate videos, web videos, promotional videos, sales and training videos, commercials, public service announcements, video news releases, television programs, infomercials and documentaries.My skillset includes research and planning, script writing, field production and all post production services included editing. I also provide voiceover and on-camera talent services as needed.Since starting my broadcasting career in 1984, there isn't much that I haven't seen, which is why I want to be your resource for ALL things video. If you'd like to see some of my work, please visit the Baerclaw Productions YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/BaerclawProductions/videos.You can learn more about my company by visiting http://www.baerclawproductions.com/.\n  \n  \n",
