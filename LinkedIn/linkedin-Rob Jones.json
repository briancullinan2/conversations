        "summary": "     For over a decade I have utilized my employerâ€™s databases to source, track, and place candidates in permanent and contract roles for engineering, technology, as well as internal positions such as sales and recruiting.  I keep up with the newest methods of recruiting and sales as well as classic methods that just work.  From How to Win Friends and Influence People to every article written by Lou Adler I am in a constant state of learning.  Presently working for myself utilizing my LinkedIn as well as a job boards to fill primarily sales, engineering, and technology roles.  I heavily work referrals, and a variety of job boards such as, Dice, Monster, and CareerBuilder, also relying heavily on social networking and professional sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and BullHorn Reach. I regularly attend userâ€™s groups both on line and on-site meetings.  I have built teams, mentored recruiters, and performed all roles from H.R., including on boarding paperwork, reviews, benefits paperwork, and FMLA.  Beyond the A-Z of recruiting I have performed as the managing recruiter in nearly every position I have held in the last decade.  Working in conjunction with the account managers/sales staff I have been able to help break into new accounts as well as expand existing accounts, by going on client meetings and asking the right questions.  Though a technical generalist, recruiting on all positions from helpdesk to C level and everything in between, I have acquired more than a basic level of technical knowledge.  Always remaining hands on, hardworking, and determined has been the key to my being successful in every company I have worked for.\n  \n  \n",
