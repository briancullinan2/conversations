The important things is learning the skills and concepts and demonstrating your knowledge in your portfolio. You can take them later on if you have the time, but I suggest focusing on learning, doing algorithms daily, and your portfolio. Afterwards you can learn interview  & job search skills and how to write your resume, and put together a plan for how to spend your time.",

I'm new but very curious and passionate. I am a quick learner with good memory and organizational skills, and a knack for seeing the big picture, visualizing concepts, and thinking outside the box. My expertise is in front-end web design and development, but I have a solid grasp of back-end concepts and very much enjoy creating games and interactive graphics with complex logic.I'm ready to transform my life by contributing to innovative technologies that transform others'!\n  \n  \n",
