Things like data structures and algorithms excite me! I'm assuming it's normal for web developers to get excited about that type of thing.... I can't be the only one (granted, I am socially awkward and better at interacting with technology than with people).Typing a few lines of code and seeing it come to life, in the form of a mobile or web application, is a magical thing for me. I spend at least 5 hours a day coding.... with my laptop in one hand and my 2 year old daughter in the other. She needs a lot of attention, but then again so does my daughter!If you have any ideas that you think I could help you with, feel free to get in touch.
