This experience charged me with directing a team of high performers to reach their qualitative potential, while maximizing their quantified sales goals. These experiences required rapid growth in my leadership and listening skills, while depending on quick adaptation to changing requirements. My experiences gave me comfort in the uncomfortable; pushing my self to see success, while communicating confidence to each of my team members. Through extensive opportunities with public speaking, face to face marketing, cold calling and continual feedback, I became comfortable with “no”, while persistantly reaching my goals. Combined with extensive experience traveling and meeting new people, I've leveraged listening, awareness and persistence to achieve several of my goals. These previous experiences give me a unique edge  other developers when creating web applications, because I always have the customer in mind when creating my software. Now, I seek an opportunity to join a strong team that can lead me to a senior role.Technical SkillsLanguages: Javascript, Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, Python, Demandware ScriptA/B Testing: Maxymiser Web-Application Frameworks: Node.js + RailsFront-end frameworks: AngularFront-end libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize, D3, React, FoundationDatabases: PostgreSQL, noSQL, MongoDBObject Relational/Document Mappers: ActiveRecordCSS precompliers: SaSSVersion Control: Git & Github, StashWorkflow: Agile, Atlassion(Jira, Confluence)\n  \n  \n",
