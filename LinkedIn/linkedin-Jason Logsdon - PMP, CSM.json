Jason was the glue to hold everything together.  He has tremendous communication skills and excels at building bridges with teams that help get things done.  He represented the program and WaMu well with his efforts.  I'd love to work with him again."

I (and other line of business stakeholders) continuously relied on her to write [and later recall] detailed business requirements, review marketing materials for accuracy and clarity, provide feedback on priority of defects found in QA, and help identify employee / customer work arounds when a solution wasn't immediately available. Bernie has an amazing memory, is extremely detailed and analytical, and truly cares about the customer / user experience.  As a project manager, you rely on key individuals to get the work done.   Whether at a manager or executive level, you will quickly find Bernie within your group of key contributors."
