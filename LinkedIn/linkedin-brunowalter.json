I focused on exceptional User Support as well as Back-Up and Disaster Recovery for the Enterprise.

During the course of both of these tangents, I also developed my skill at interacting with both vendors and support providers so as to optimize the benefits that Syntellect received from both. I was Administrator for our Sales Force, CommVault Shoretel, Postini, LogMeIn, Sophos services as well as MS Active Directory and System Center and our Support Ticketing System.
