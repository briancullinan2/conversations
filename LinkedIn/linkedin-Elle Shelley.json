Aside from her expertise in the world of strategy and marketing, Elle is a pleasure to work with.  Know that after she pitches her ideas for your project you will be sold and later wonder if you just got taken because it all may seem to good to be true.  From our experience she always delivers what she says and more.  She is so vested in her projects that she will feel more like a business partner than a consultant.  Her best quality is her integrity.  She has seen us through many difficult situations that others would have taken advantage of and assured themselves an undue profit.  In every circumstance, Elle does what is right for the client even at her own expense.  Integrity is almost impossible to find and parred with her creative instinct and understanding of how to speak to potential consumers, a strategist like Elle cannot be found. Our hope would be to offer Elle a permanent position as soon as we can afford her."
