        "summary": "    I am a young business man who is always looking for new opportunities to invest in new projects.  I am always keeping a look out to get in on the ground floor of something I can see becoming huge. I would love to hear and talk through any ideas you may have. I have always loved new innovative ideas that change the world.I want to be a part of something bigger than me, I love doing charity work.  I like working for something that helps others with out anything in return.  I want to find something new to get involved with.  As far as my interests in a career go, I am very open minded and have no paths already set in stone. I want to take each opportunity I am faced with and analyze it with no bars holding me back.  Something I am also passionate about is acting.  I always want to find new parts to audition for. I prefer acting on film more than theatre, although i still do enjoy it and look to perform more in the theatre.Thank you for taking the time to read my summary and I really do hope you will message me so we can get to know each other and share ideas for what might be something to change the world we know.  \n  \n  \n",
