In addition to five days of Community Clinic in Cahuide, Peru where H2H participants worked triage to treat 400 patients from the local area, we:· Took part in indigenous ceremonies,· participated in perma-culture activities,· stayed at and learned about The Paititi Institute for the Preservation for the Amazonian Rainforest and Indigenous Culture,· experienced lectures about healing on many levels and modalities,· and studied indigenous traditions and natural medicine.I also taught yoga at the Paititi Institute.This was an opportunity for me to aid and learn from a population that is un(der)-represented and often marginalized. I also had the chance to learn and deepen my own healing practice and skills, and evolve as a human/spiritual being."

                "Stephanie offers work \"for your graphic or web design pleasures . . . \" - and it truly is a pleasure working with her. From the moment I sit down with her to discuss a graphic concept she is focused, listening, taking notes, and sketching out ideas. She knows exactly what kinds of questions to ask in order to find out what I truly want. The finished product is much more amazing than I could have ever imagined myself; working with Stephanie is truly co-creating. Her work is cutting edge, visually appealing, and (for me) fun. She created my business cards two years ago, and recently, my meditation cd cover, and is currently working on my web site. I will hire Stephanie every time I need graphic help; I couldn't recommend her enough!"

        "summary": "    Creativity and viewing the world from a variety of perspectives is essential to sustainability. I like altering my reality through imagination, playing with color, movement, and breath — and I help others do the same through yoga and the workshop Writing the Energetic Body, a practice of “exploring writing through the lens of the chakra system.\"My work is a physical response to my relationship with Nature and how I move through it. I’m not satisfied with skittering along the surface, with looking at the world from a distance—I have to dive in, get dirty. Whether I’m mountain biking, meditating, writing or painting, I explore the edges, the places of shift and change, where the thin quiver of constant movement along boundaries is almost unseen. Pushing the edge requires being in the moment; it can be prickly, sharp, and jagged—it can also be fun, expansive, and sublime. My work often begins as a meditation in agitation. Pressing the surface of discomfort, moving with the medium, creates a shift. The result is playful and raw. I know a piece is done when I step back and find myself dancing.\n  \n  \n",
