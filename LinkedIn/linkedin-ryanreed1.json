He was successful in this new role and as a consequence, was recently assigned a larger scope of work reporting directly to our General Manager to deliver additional customer value. He is a detail focused, consistently solid performer that can be relied upon to manage differing priorities and a heavy, semi-ambiguous workload. He is effective in developing relationships and managing across his peers and partners, as well as interacting with senior leadership. I very much enjoyed working with Ryan and I would recommend him for similar roles without reservation."
