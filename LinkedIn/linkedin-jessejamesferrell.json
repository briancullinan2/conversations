The signature treatment, since dubbed the Jesse James Method™, unerringly releases past patterns of tension. Moving beyond routines and recipes, Jesse James Method™ is a creative, dynamic, problem-solving approach that challenges therapists to feel with their hands, think with their brain and listen with their heart. Clients consistently report relief from pain and trauma stored for years—sometimes decades—in their muscle tissue. When a client’s body releases those past patterns, their health, vitality and freedom of movement is restored in a way they never thought possible!\"When you tap into the power of your mind, body and spirit through the Jesse James Method™, you give yourself the gift of a lifetime,\" says Jesse. \"It’s a gift we are profoundly honored to deliver at Jesse James Body Wellness. My greatest desire in life is seeing you return to living in your bodies’ natural synergy, with freedom and harmony.\""
