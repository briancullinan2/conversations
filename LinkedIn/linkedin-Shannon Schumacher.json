While we weren't on the same team, we collaborated on a regular basis to support corporate initiatives and drive customer excellence through optimization and analysis.  Lary has the most humble demeanor though he is one of the most brilliant database engineers I've ever worked with.  He always has a friendly smile on his face and is willing to go above and beyond to solve a challenge, even when the challenge does not directly impact him or his team. Lary has a customer-first mindset and was such a pleasure to work with and a truly participative/democratic, down-to-earth leader whom I hope to collaborate with again in the future."
