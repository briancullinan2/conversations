They argue that they and their team have it all under control and shouldn't ever need a guy like me. One guy said, \"if I used you I'd be failing\". This is just bad business. I work with multiple Fortune 100 clients on a consistent basis; companies with hundreds of internal recruiters. They understand that what I do, the service I provide, is very different from what an internal recruiting  team does. In fact, we complement one another. Using a headhunter isn't a failure, it's an investment. And like any other investment, when done properly you'll see increased returns.",

I learned a lot from Sean about operations, but most importantly, I learned how to drive great results while maintaining high morale and low attrition during a difficult chapter in the business cycle at eBay/PayPal.  Sean is a great people manager who knows how to build high performing teams; any company would be lucky to have him in a senior executive role."

Understanding those needs and priorities comes through continual communication, education and collaboration.  The needs of the business are changing more and more rapidly, which means a technology leader who can build a responsive and agile IT organization, prompting the building of a responsive and agile enterprise architecture upon which the business runs is invaluablehttp://hellophello.net/hi/seanharding\n  \n  \n",
