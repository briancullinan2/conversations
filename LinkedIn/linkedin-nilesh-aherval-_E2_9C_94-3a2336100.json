After trying other jobs I decided I should explore my love of computers and tried programming on my own. I loved every minute of it.I'm excited to continue learning everything I can. I like to watch Udemy videos and try new things all the time.I really enjoy every aspect of web development, the front-end with HTML, Angular, and CSS . Also the back-end with Node, Express, and all of things. I enjoy writing code then re-writing it until it's as efficient and lean as it can possibly be, supporting all edge cases I can think of.\n  \n  \n",
