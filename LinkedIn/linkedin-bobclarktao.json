                "TAO is an effective treatment for anxiety and other mental health problems that allows the patient or client to proactively work on behavioral change and the clinician to monitor progress on treatment tasks and symptom change over time. The result is effective treatment with one-third the counselor time and half the overall cost of traditional face-to-face individual treatment. College and university counseling centers, employee assistance programs, outpatient mental health clinics, VA medical centers, community mental health centers, and private practitioners will purchase a license for TAO, receive training in providing the treatment, and pay a small fee per patient per module. TAO Connect’s technology is licensed, exclusively, from the University of Florida."
