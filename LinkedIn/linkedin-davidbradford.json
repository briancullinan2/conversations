                "Imagine a learning environment where instead of having video games interfering with classroom instruction, video game technology is at the core of your instructional paradigm. Video games are a dominant form of entertainment today because they immersive and exciting. On planet earth, we spend 3 Billion hours a week playing video games; There are nearly 2 Billion smart phones in the world; 1 Billion people are currently learning English as a second language; And Virtual Reality was just featured on the cover of Time Magazine. Our company, FluentWorlds, has taken advantage of this confluence of industry trends and built an App for your smartphone or tablet specifically designed to teach English as a Second language while playing a serious game. Learning a foreign language is always easiest when you are IMMERSED in an environment. FluentWorlds allows language learners to immerse themselves in a Video Game just like you would be if playing Candy Crush without the cost of actually going to New York, Las Vegas, or London.  Users travel through through a series of 3d Virtual environments from the comfort of their smart phone or tablet. Our first language App is written for native Spanish speakers who are interested in learning English as a Second Language. The Ability to speak English is no longer a \"nice to have\"​ it is a \"Must have.  The PhD studies of the Founder of FluentWorlds, Dr. Linda Bradford, showed that student learning outcomes are higher when playing a virtual game than in a physical classroom. Users enter a series of 3d virtual world games allowing avatars to learn and interact in a simulated game situation. While in the 3D adventures, they will learn social language skills - those one would use in a hotel, airport, home or restaurant, etc. It is Magical! Fluentworlds changes the world of eLearning forever."
