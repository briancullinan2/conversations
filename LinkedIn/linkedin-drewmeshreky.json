From the moment I met Drew I was impressed with his openness towards people and his sincere willingness to listen.  These qualities are what make him excel as a manager, along with, his impeccable communication skills and ability to adapt to situations.  In his initial meetings as a new manager there was constant praise from the project team about how he immediately added value to the product.  Also, his technical skills are excellent.
