She is very versatile, working with our design firm at one point in the project to assist with every detail in designing several features, contributing to internal review sessions, and the implementing the features with onshore and offshore development groups.  I totally trust her because I know she is highly invested in her work, it shows with her attention to detail and her understanding of what she is doing.
