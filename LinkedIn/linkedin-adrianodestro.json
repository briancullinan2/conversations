                "Inspiring mentor. Hana has been my teacher for the 'entrepreneuring workshop' at IE Business School.She brought us to another reasoning level that our class didn't immediately perceived, but her ability consisted in giving us the right tools and hints to finally understand it.Last question she asked us was about the feeling we were having at the end of the workshop, and the first thing that came to my mind was \"provoked\". Something happened, like a change of perspectives, she displayed us a new way to approach issues and different situations by giving us the opportunity to be open to learn and to do an hands-on experience.Sharp, patient, always smiling, traits that makes her the teacher you wish you had."

        "summary": "    Your vision of where or who you want to be is the greatest asset you have. Without having a goal it's difficult to score. - Paul ArdenThe one quote inspiring my everyday life and my career's management.Proud Italian by birth and citizen of the world by choice. As I lived and studied in 4 different countries, Italy, England, Spain and Holland I ended up enlarging my network, broadening my horizons andbecoming a better version of myself. Resilience, tolerance and self-awareness are the personal traits, I feel I refined the most during these years, always on the go, constantly changing environment and adapting to different realities. I am inspired by great visions, leaders as makers and human capital development, I believe in actions that count and in a visible impact of my future contribution.My areas of expertise cover digital business, marketing & advertising management, businessdevelopment, digital marketing, social media strategy, startups, small & medium businesses (SMBs).About my role as team member, after 50+ projects, run with 40+ nationalities, all the constructive conflicts and discussions I have been through, encouraged me to be open to criticism, to compromise when the situation calls for it and to be assertive when necessary. I discovered a natural instinct to take responsibility and initiative and all the good and bad that comes with them.My continue quest for feedbacks, helped me in this learning process. If you were to ask my colleagues, I‚Äôm confident they‚Äôd describe me as a skilful networker, empathetic motivator, powerful communicator and good friend; at the same time, being Italian I turn out to be talkative, straightforward and a bit demanding, so still a lot to work on there!Where do I imagine myself in 5 years? I might confess it's a bit hard to envision, or maybe it's just the neapolitan superstition that comes into play. I can only anticipate that who I will be working with, will be as much as important as what I will do.\n  \n  \n",
