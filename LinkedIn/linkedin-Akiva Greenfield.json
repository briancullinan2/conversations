        "summary": "    As a thought leader, I believe in simplifying laborious tasks for physicians and their staff to keep patient care as the primary focus, not billing and insurance nonsense. Being raised in a family of physicians, I'm well-acquainted with pesky day-to-day chores that create a bottleneck in most practices. To help alleviate this constant obstacle, I've successfully spearheaded healthcare-oriented ventures that provide a reliable and efficient outsourcing platform to relieve medical practices of administrative burdens.  At LUX Health Network, our vision is to reinvent the way consumers access healthcare. We open our unprecedented network of elite primary and specialty care physicians to our clients for a truly exclusive, highly coordinated concierge experience. We've created a unique model that complements your lifestyle and medical needs. We do the work so you won’t have to.  At Nexus Healthcare Solutions, we implement processes that help medical practices take care of all back-end operations. From billing to consulting, we take pride in our prompt, comprehensive, and professional delivery. Treating patients is your business, running a practice is ours.    The Right Choice Caregiving, The Doctor’s Choice Home Health, and The Comfort Choice Hospice were established to care not only for patients but also their families. Our experienced team and skilled nurses and therapists create a comforting, safe, and supportive environment to help you acclimatize to the changes brought on by life-threatening maladies.
