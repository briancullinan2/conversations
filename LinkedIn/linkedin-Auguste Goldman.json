        "summary": "    Technology has changed how people create, communicate, and work—helping all of us to optimize our own talents and reach previously unobtainable heights.  My passion throughout my career has been to build tech that makes life better—and to make life better for those who build tech.  Back in the day, before I joined GoDaddy, I served as Managing Director of Integralis Security Services in Stockholm, Sweden and CTO of Linde AG, the world’s largest Natural Gas Company based in Munich, Germany.  That experience led me to GoDaddy—initially as CIO (including Product Development, IT Operations, Information Security and R&D) and now as the Chief People Officer.Making the jump from technical operations to “human resources” is virtually unheard of in tech, but it shouldn’t be.  The perspective and skills gained from leading engineering and development can’t be taught in a book and, I find, is essential to recruiting and rewarding the best technologists in the world.  GoDaddy is a technology company—built from great engineers, brilliant data scientists and innovative product development teams.  We are also, of course, an incredible sales and marketing company and our ever-growing care and consulting team (now almost 4,000 strong) is a secret weapon for us in the quest to serve small business better than any other enterprise on the planet.GoDaddy is a company that values, celebrates and welcomes the diverse marketplace of ideas from employees at every level.  It’s a killer place to start your careers in tech and it’s equally great to bring your years of experience.  Our vision is “to radically shift the global economy toward small business by empowering people to easily start, confidentially grow and successfully run their own ventures.”  That’s big, it’s potentially world changing and could use your help.  If you’re passionate about making the world a better place, exceptional in your drive and talent and considering the next step in your carrier, drop me a note or a line.\n  \n  \n",
