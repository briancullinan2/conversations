        "summary": "    I'm a collection of three billion, billion, billion intricately arranged atoms that has grown conscious and able to ponder its existence. Truly think about that; we are atoms arranged in such a way that we know we are atoms. I am interested in various technologies a multitude of languages and more sciences than any one person could possibly learn in a single lifetime. So I learn as much as I can, about everything I can, taking advantage of every opportunity whenever I can. That being said, it should go without saying, I love to take on projects that require me to learn new and interesting things as well as projects or clients that challenge me to be better. To be better at that which I already know and to be better at understanding that which I do not know.  If you said I was addicted to learning you would not be lying.lying at the highest levels of my professional experience and interest are Internet Marketing and Web Development (in all their many amazing facets). While I have a general passion for programming and building things, web-based technologies, languages, and support are where I prefer to spend most of my time, energy, and focus. That being said, I am always open to new technologies, opportunities to learn and make new connections and build new relationships. I believe myself to be one of a lucky few that have the luxury of loving their job. I quote loosely: \"If you love what you do you will never truly work a day in your life.\"To know more about me, my availability, or have any other professional or personal inquiries, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to answer any replies!Regards,Daniel M\n  \n  \n",
