Started with a classroom at the School District and developed the organization to serve 4 diverse communities and over 2,500 youth annually.  Merged the Ramona organization with the Escondido organization in 2000 creating Boys & Girls Clubs United. In 2002 Boys & Girls Clubs United merged with Boys & Girls Clubs of San Diego and created Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater San Diego. Served as Senior Vice President for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Scottsdale in the area of resource development and marketing raising nearly $5,000,000 annually from individuals, corporations and foundations. As CEO for the Alameda Boys & Girls Club I have provided leadership that has seen the annual budget double in size, our foundation increase over 400%, operating reserves increase over 500% and the Board of Directors more than double its size. Through staff development the Alameda Club is serving nearly twice the number of kids it did just 5 years ago. I would eventually like to run a foundation where I can touch several non-profits, providing resources as well as connections to help them sustain programs and operations.Specialties: Resource Development, Planned Giving, Annual Campaigns, Capital Campaigns, Board Development, Direct Mail Campaigns, Major Gifts, Marketing, Program Development\n  \n  \n",
