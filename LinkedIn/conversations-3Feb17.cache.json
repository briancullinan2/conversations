Visionaries are not always great leaders (i.e., Steve Jobs). They need to know how to inspire their team, not how to motivate it. They also need to be looking good for talent that can answer their questions, allow the team to follow their curiosity (it may move away from the core vision, but provide something that is tangent to or supports that vision down the road). And the biggest step in developing a solution is changing the view from \"Why hasn't some one done something about this?\" To\"Why haven't I done something about this?\" Show your passion, and like minded and sometimes smarter people will be inspired and rally to your cause.",
