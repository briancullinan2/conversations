He's hard on himself, but he writes really clean, understandable code, has a great work ethic, is self motivated , disciplined, and has a high standard of personal excellence. In addition to all of those things, his quarter 1, 2, and 3 projects and his capstone project all reflected a great attention to visual detail.  He also chose projects that required a good deal of logic / programming skill on the back end. Lastly, Satoshi's ability to present and his sense of humor in a group setting was unparalleled in his class.  Some of the humor and satire in his presentations are things that I still laugh about in retrospect when reflecting on his presentation.  English being his second language, he has a better sense of humor in English than most people who are native speakers. I highly recommend Satoshi; I would hire him myself if given the opportunity."

I am a permanent resident. **I filled several roles throughout the nine years I spent in the semiconductor industry, adapting to new business needs as they emerged. During this time, I had several opportunities to work on software problems. These experiences made me realize that I wanted to be the one creating code. As a result, I spent six months at Galvanize, a web-development school, learning how to be a full-stack software engineer. I hope to work for an employer who values versatility, learning, and constant growth.\n  \n  \n",
