                "I think the capacity to love and have empathy for people is an essential ingredient for business. The fact human beings exist on these two things is fundamental to existence. And the fact that a company is made of people is often lost on most people. I grew up being told you have to be shrewd and smart with people in business. And then the management guys came and told me a lot of things on strategy, markets and finance. Yet to meet a bloke who talks about passion, love and empathy as fundamental building blocks of a company. People are not \"Resources\". They are human beings first. And the difference between \"good\" and \"great\" is actually a motivated team.",
