In other words, we quietly learn from their behaviour and then \"Augment their Reality\"​ by overlaying information directly onto their natural work environment. Some of the technologies we use to accomplish this, include: ▫ NLP (JVM toolkits) ▫ Machine Learning (JVM toolkits) ▫ Data Engineering and Data Science (Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Azure DataLake/Analytics, Kinesis, Presto) ▫ DevOps (AWS, Azure, Docker, Terraform) ▫ Front-end (EcmaScript 6, Typescript, Aurelia, Foundation) ▫ Back-end (Kotlin with Vert.x 3, ElasticSearch, Apache Ignite, many AWS services) ▫ Plugin development for Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans, VisualStudio▫ Plugin development for Gradle, Maven, Ant, SBT, TeamCity, Jenkins, Bamboo, etc. Everything we do is at scale, there is no \"small\"​ version of our data and definitely no \"we will fix it later.\""
