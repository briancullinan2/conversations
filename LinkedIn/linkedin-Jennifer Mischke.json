                "To all of my Ohio connections, you're well represented with this guy. I love it when a professional athlete is humble, kind and a good example. This is Kyle Rudolph MN Vikings tight-end, 6:55 AM Sunday morning outside Yo-Yo Donuts in Minnetonka. He has a reputation for being a class act. A leader on and off the field, he's active in the community with charity events, gives back constantly and stays out of trouble. My favorite part of this morning is he reminded the kids to work hard in school and on the field...on a side note we both love @Tigerfit and when I mentioned that he looked at me and laughing said that Chris and Stacie wouldn't appreciate this donut run! ðŸ˜³ ðŸ˜‚",
