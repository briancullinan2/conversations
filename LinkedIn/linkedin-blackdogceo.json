Before the drink was bottled and named rivvibe™, it was an unassuming moringa tea that the Rivera family would use to stay hydrated, refreshed, and energized. It was an iced tea on a hot summer day or steeped in a warm mug during the cooler months. We carefully adapted the Rivera family recipe to maintain the original integrity of the drink, along with the 100% all natural ingredient list, so we could bring a new hydration experience to people living active lifestyles."

I would recommend meeting with Scott and attending one of his events if you are looking to make some investments in smaller businesses.  I also was impressed with his business acumen and understanding of an entrepreneur's needs. If an entrepreneur is looking for some advice on how to get your business to the next level Scott would be a valuable resource."
