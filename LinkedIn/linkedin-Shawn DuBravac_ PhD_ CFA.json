                "Yesterday I spoke about the Quiet Revolution at a conference hosted by KPMG at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. I was more nervous than usual, because the audience was overwhelmingly male, senior, and hard-nosed (at least judging by their wardrobes — most wearing suits; and by their professions — most of them leaders in finance). I’ve spoken to plenty of businesspeople before, of course, but this group felt more intimidating than usual. Yet it turned out to be one of the warmest, friendliest and most receptive audiences I’ve ever had the pleasure to address. Thank you to Gary Silberg and John Sadaka from KPMG, and to Mark Lewis at Booth School of Business for hosting me, and thanks to all who were there for engaging so enthusiastically in all things quiet. And special thanks to those who asked during the Q and A about bringing this work to kids and schools, so we can take good care of the next generation.",

                "In Digital Destiny: How the New Age of Data Will Transform the Way We Work, Live, and Communicate, Shawn DuBravac, chief economist and senior director of research at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), argues that the groundswell of digital ownership unfolding in our lives signals the beginning of a new era for humanity. Beyond just hardware acquisition, the next decade will be defined by an all-digital lifestyle and the “Internet of Everything”—where everything, from the dishwasher to the wristwatch, is not only online, but acquiring, analyzing, and utilizing the data that surrounds us. But what does this mean in practice?It means that some of mankind’s most pressing problems, such as hunger, disease, and security, will finally have a solution. It means that the rise of driverless cars could save thousands of American lives each year, and perhaps hundreds of thousands more around the planet. It means a departure from millennia-old practices, such as the need for urban centers. It means that massive inefficiencies, such as the supply chains in Africa allowing food to rot before it can be fed to the hungry, can be overcome. It means that individuals will have more freedom in action, work, health, and pursuits than ever before.See more here: http://amzn.to/1Nl2ukr",
