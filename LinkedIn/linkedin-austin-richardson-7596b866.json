                "I worked with Austin at the Westin Phoenix Downtown and he was always very friendly, very positive and his work was completed in a timely manor without mistakes. All of the hotel rooms were maintained well and in immaculate condition thanks to Austin and Chuck Szilagyi. The meeting and banquet rooms were always ready for the upcoming events without any issues. It was nice to work with you Austin."
