I left the law practice for a career in software sales and marketing several years ago and never looked back.  Since that time I've had the opportunity to be involved in so many great things at SaaS startups, including Appointment-Plus, a leading cloud scheduling provider, Lawlogix, and Axosoft.  Helping to build SaaS startups is a lot of fun.\n  \n  \n",
