As soon as I mentioned someone else working on innovating shipping, he shut me down immediately. \"No one else is doing this, don't tell anyone about it because its such an amazing idea.\" More importantly, how to you put people together to build something \"innovative\" with that attitude? How do you manage your way around it? Everyone thinks their idea is THE GREATEST EVER, but we know that 1000 other people out of 7 billion had the exact same idea. Innovation is just a minor logical progression, but its found by putting effective people together. How do you manage this from my position? He also asked me to help write the software interface, so he literally has nothing but thinks he has everything.",
