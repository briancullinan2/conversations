It has been 2 years now since I first met Gerry and he has helped me in the two jobs I have had in that time.  I am now a producer at an Advertising Agency in Phoenix and Gerry is my go to guy for all my props and set builds.  He is experienced, thorough, and an amazing craftsman. For example one production we had we needed a lemonade stand built in the short time frame of a week.  Gerry not only delivered this prop on time and under budget, but the craftsmanship was so well thought out it made it one of the easiest props that I have ever dealt with.  Gerry made a solid wood structure out of high quality materials that could be disassembled into multiple pieces for easy transport and with adjustable heights for talent of different sizes.Keep Gerry in mind for anything you need built, I guarantee he will meet your budget, quality standards, and time frame for every project!"
