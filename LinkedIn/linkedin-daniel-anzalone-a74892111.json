I've even closed deals on Christmas Day. Some of my highlights include:- closing 7 new customers while taking all the phone calls on Memorial Day 2015. - Pulling off the freeway to close a sale in the parking lot of a gas station, the sale was a $5,000 item.- Closing entire bathroom remodel packages over the phone without having ever met the client in person, or seeing their bathroom. I was able to build enough trust and rapport that they paid a deposit and allowed us to move forward."
