I am still trying to figure out how social networking thing works. I understood what you are expressing from your previous message. But more importantly now I understand how much this weighs on your mind. I will never stop job hunting again. Even though I can make it through the next few months, just by speaking to people hiring I can gain insight in to their ambitions and absorb new information faster. If you detected any hostility it is from the hiring process in general. They are not asking hard enough questions nor do these questions exercise a person's cognitive abilities.
