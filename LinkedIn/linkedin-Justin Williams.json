He is intelligent, extremely well informed not just about the high-tech sectors of Southern Arizona, but about entrepreneurship in general and entrepreneurship within the high-tech sectors.  Justin is loyal, having stepped in as Interim Director when he was sorely needed to come back.  He is excellent in his relationship building skills, he is organized and highly-reliable.
