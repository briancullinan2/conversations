His new book and PBS special, Eat Fat Get Thin, was released in March 2016 to address the global epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular and other related diseases.Dr. Hyman is the world’s leading pioneer and practitioner of a ground-breaking and emerging approach to medicine that treats our system, not our symptoms.Through functional medicine, we come to understand all the influences on our biology which are at the root of illness, and how our lifestyle and environment interact with our genes to create the imbalances or balances that are the real determinants of disease or poorDr. Hyman is the Director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine,  founder and medical director of The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, Massachusetts, where he directs a team of physicians, nutritionists and nurses who utilize this comprehensive, life-changing approach to health, involving diet and lifestyle modifications, in combination with nutritional and specialized testing, nutritional supplementation, and medications to address individual needs, from creating wellness to treating chronic, complex medical problems.He maintains that our grocery store should be our drug store:  “What is at the end of our fork,” he declares, “is more essential and important than what it at the bottom of our pill bottles.” And, “each meal is a chance to heal.”Specialties: Functional Medicine\n  \n  \n",
