During that time she demonstrated a solid knowledge of not only the C programming language, but also programming and software engineering concepts in general.  I canhappily say that her experience was a valuable addition to the programming team.  Perhaps even more importantly, she has repeatedly shown the ability to rapidly grasp new concepts and learn new skills, a valuable trait in today's competitive and dynamic industry.Furthermore, for the entire time I worked with Xiangmiao, I was impressed by the enthusiasm with which she tackled new and challenging problems.  Xiangmiao seems to have a genuine interest and excitement about her field of study, which I believe is something that cannot be underestimated in its value in the workplace, especially in such a technical field.  I think her enthusiasm is contagious, and as such, a valuable asset to any team."
