                "I had the pleasure of working with Peter when the CO+HOOTS Foundation and CO+HOOTS coworking space were seeking the space in Midtown. Most recently I am on the Advisory Board of Hera Hub Phoenix coworking space and he helped them to find the perfect location.  Coworking is a challenging category to find property in but more importantly a commercial realtor who gets that coworking isn't just a big open space-- it's a community designed space.  Peter understands the  unique challenges with tenant improvements, parking, and other open space needs.  He also knows how to explain this business model to  landlords and property owners who don't necessarily fully understand.  My favorite part of working with Peter was that before meetings he would always coach us on what to expect, and during meetings he always made sure things were clear on all sides with next steps outlined so that the project didn't lag.   I am grateful to have worked with him and as a result consider him not just a tremendous realtor, but  a wonderful mentor and friend."
