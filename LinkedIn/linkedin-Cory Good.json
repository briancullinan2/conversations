                "Tasha is one of the best sales reps that I've ever had the pleasure of managing.  She is a detail oriented hunter that really thinks through a deal.  She does a great job of getting to the top to find the key business drivers and leverages those along with excellent relationships to drive a deal top down.  Tasha also does a great job of leading the internal sales team and collaborating closely with them to make sure that everyone is in sync.  She listens to others feedback and effectively integrates that into the strategy."
