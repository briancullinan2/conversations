I want to make sure what people want is aligned with what we can offer. Not many recruiters fill roles with a view to retention and best fit. As a candidate, speaking to a recruiter who cares about your interests is a good way to weed out good recruiters from those focused on just filling roles. Unfortunately good recruiters are hard to find and as a result so many hiring practices in companies are very flawed. We're not perfect either but we're working on it.",
