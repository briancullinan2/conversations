                "Eric is a very talented UI/UX professional. I worked on many projects with Eric and can tell you that he always delivers high quality UI/UX. He works well in a team setting and with clients. He continually refines the design until everyone is happy. I have seem him grow his skills in web development to the point where our teams could leverage his UI/UX prototypes and save a ton of time and effort. He has picked up HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and other technologies to provide lots of value to his teams and clients. He is very accomplished in producing still graphics, motion graphics, video production and many other areas of expertise. He is thoughtful, kind and funny. I'd love to work with Eric again and can say that he'd be a great addition to any team or organization."
