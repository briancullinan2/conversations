                "I have known Kristy for over 15 years and had the pleasure of working with her on several business related projects.  While she was the Vice President of Sales at Talent Tree, she was awarded exclusive partner ship of temporary labor at CSK Auto Inc.  Kristy ensured the most qualified managers were handling our account and the customer service was unbeatable.  Kristy has an eye for detail and addressed any issues immediately.  She is an impressive manager that delivered results in a timely manner.  Kristy has always been reliable and determined to ensure the best customer service was offered.  Her proven track record formed another business relationship at Lakeshore Staffing.  Again, she ensured the best people were in place to adminstrate the CSK account.  One of Kristy's strongest attributes is her relationship building expertise.  Her business decisions are sound and result driven.  I look forward to a continued business relationship with Kristy as she is the person you want on your team when you are looking for talented team members."
