        "summary": "    For the last five years I have created a new, comprehensive process for the resolution of disputes between parties where the on-going relationship matters more than their respective rights. Going beyond the bounds of traditional litigation and the adversarial approaches used in the court system, Solution-Focused Conciliation(TM) is now a reality and is being used by couples, business, and others to resolve their disputes outside of the jurisdiction of the courts. It offers an affordable, fixed fee that is scaled based on income or assets. It combines a variety of coordinated custom-packaged services tailored to the needs of the clients. The services extend for a significant period beyond the resolution of the dispute in order to support the parties in making the relationship work long term. See the website at www.TheResolutionCenterINDY.comHistorically my legal and mediation practice was focused primarily in the areas of divorce and family mediation. I have conducted and settled several thousand family mediations over the last 23 years. My on-going practice of law is limited to the representation of family law clients who are disadvantaged by financial, mental health, or other substantial disabilities in the prosecution or defense of their case. My primary goal in any representation is to educate and support my clients in the legal, financial, social, physical,  psychological, and spiritual issues that affect their particular circumstances for the ultimate purpose of empowering them to make and implement their own decisions.\n  \n  \n",
