        "summary": "    I specialize in working with ambitious leaders to build and refresh strong brands, design effective strategies, and produce enduring creative experiences. I love working at the intersection of creativity, community, and purpose.  Over the last 12 years I have directed multiple arts businesses, built nonprofits from the ground up, and managed numerous national and international creative projects. I studied Art History as an undergraduate, got my Masters Degree in Arts Management from Carnegie Mellon, and am a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). In my free time, you'll find me in the mountains, adventuring (my next big trip is Antarctica!), or volunteering in the community. I sit on the Art Advisory Committee and Monarch Council at the Desert Botanical Garden, helping to build Spaces of Opportunity, an 18-acre community garden in South Phoenix. I also serve on the board of the Arizona Association of Food Banks and is a former Vice President of the Roosevelt Row Community Development Corporation. My Specialties: Producing creative projects, arts curation, brand strategy, organization and planning, project management, exhibition management, strategic planning, facilitation\n  \n  \n",
