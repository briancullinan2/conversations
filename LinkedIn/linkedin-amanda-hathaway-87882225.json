There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them\".For my undergraduate degree I chose to attend Northern Arizona University and pursue a degree in Interior Design with a minor in Visual Communications. Through my education I gained experience with AutoCAD, Revit, Sketch-Up, Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator.  I graduated summa cum laude in May 2015, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Interior Design with a minor in Visual Communications.  Moving on to the next phase of my life I am eager to continue learning and grow within the industry.  I am a detail and goal-oriented associate, as well as a fast learner.  My goals are to eventually pursue a master's degree and become NCIDQ certified.Digital Portfolio:http://a-hathaway.wix.com/ahdesigns \n  \n  \n",
