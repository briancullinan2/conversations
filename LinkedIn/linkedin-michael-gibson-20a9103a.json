Previously, I was a Director of Sales for Medallia and an Enterprise Account Manager for EMC covering accounts in Arizona, Las Vegas and Southern California.  I graduated out of EMC's acclaimed Inside Sales program in Franklin, MA in July of 2013.  I was able to earn a field position due to my accomplishments in the Inside Sales program after only ten months, in a program that normally takes a minimum of two years.  Prior to working in sales, I was a Division I college basketball coach for seven years at Michigan State University, Arizona State University, and Drake University.  At one point, I was the youngest Division I college basketball assistant coach in the country.I earned a 3.97 GPA in Business Administration at Carnegie Mellon University\n  \n  \n",
