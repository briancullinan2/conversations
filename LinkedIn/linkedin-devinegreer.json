With direct analytics a business will be able to record and track just how well their investment is performing. A business cannot receive efficient stats and customer satisfaction through a billboard and rarely do you have customers that want to be pestered with a \"How did you find us?\" survey. Corporations already noticing the impact, rushed the process, leaving one crucial puzzle piece behind. Tweet T.V. takes the business to customer relationship one step further, a crucial step that a business will not find else where. It is not a one size fits all, it is a true personal plan for each individual business; strategically analyzing long term objectives, building a bridge to connect the gaps, making each vision a reality."
