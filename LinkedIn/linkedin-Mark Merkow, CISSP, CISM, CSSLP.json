Leveraged effective media and tools to create culturally- and geographically -appropriate Security Awareness and Training campaigns to help people understand that “Security is Everyone’s Responsibility.” Led the development and implementation of security awareness campaigns for Lock It When You Leave It, Compliance Jeopardy Game, an Information Security Related Haiku contest and in-person events that bring industry experts to PayPal to share their experiences and knowledge with PayPal software developers, Site Operations Personnel, and Information Security personnel. Our rotating Data Protection Weeks reach thousands of Call Center personnel with security training and security awareness that rapidly reminds them of their responsibilities for handling sensitive customer information and offers them a forum to answer specific questions -- given their limited time for training and contact.Using a variety of measurement tools to gauge the effectiveness of a campaign, we were able to prove that the Lock It When You Leave It campaign alone effected positive behavior changes in 65% of the participants we surveyed."
