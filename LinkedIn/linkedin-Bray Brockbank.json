He collaborates well and never lets ego get in the way of objectives and relationships. Bray unified the team and we mutually worked towards meeting our goals each month. He wanted me to succeed personally and professionally. Bray handled the pressure of being our marketing leader with a calm confidence. He faced lofty goals and managed a split marketing team, where half of the staff worked internationally. He was never openly perplexed or acted reactively to challenging situations. He genuinely sought to do what was best for the situation and congenially defended his position based on experience and expertise. He listened to every suggestion objectively. I would recommend Bray as a marketing leader/executive and hope my path crosses with his again in the future."

He collaborates well and never lets ego get in the way of objectives and relationships. Bray unified the team and we mutually worked towards meeting our goals each month. He wanted me to succeed personally and professionally. Bray handled the pressure of being our marketing leader with a calm confidence. He faced lofty goals and managed a split marketing team, where half of the staff worked internationally. He was never openly perplexed or acted reactively to challenging situations. He genuinely sought to do what was best for the situation and congenially defended his position based on experience and expertise. He listened to every suggestion objectively. I would recommend Bray as a marketing leader/executive and hope my path crosses with his again in the future."
