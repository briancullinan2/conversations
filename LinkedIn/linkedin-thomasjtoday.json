As of today, the articles they wrote still receive the most organic visitors.Thomas is a good guy to work with because he is clear in his thought process. However, as always with anybody make sure you have outlined goals and target objectives. For example, I want to look inside Google Analytics and see decreased Bounce Rates by X percent and increase Time-on-Site by Y seconds, on or before Z month.@KendallMatthews"
