I explained how trust was fundamental to all we did, how we succeed or fail based on how well we establish and maintain our client’s trust (and, by extension, the trust of our partners, vendors, auditors, regulators, and shareholders). After all, our clients would never believe we were there to help them if they didn’t trust what we were doing, and how we were doing it.",
                "What got me excited was how our staff really got it. You could see the spark in their eyes. I would explain that they didn’t have to read the regulations, or the contracts, or the standards. It was my job to do that for them, and translate them into directions that made sense in the context of their roles.  Still, they all understood that these things were essential, and that I would work with them to make this whole mess make sense, and work within the context of what we wanted to do for our clients. It was always about the clients, and doing what was best for them. After all, that was our duty, as a fiduciary.",
