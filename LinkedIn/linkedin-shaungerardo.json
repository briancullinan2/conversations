I am confident that Shaun would be an asset to any company that has the opportunity to hire him. He has personality, a unique presence that exudes confidence and and it in turn, helps the client have confidence in him. Shaun worked well and was adaptable to any and all events we involved him in whether it was with children or adults and he was outgoing and engaging to to all. It was a pleasure to have him work for us and we continue to use him as an example to what others should strive for. We wish him the best of luck in all his future successes!"

        "summary": "    Shaun Gerardo,hailing from a rough neighborhood in Arizona, has worked diligently with his markedly powerful work ethic to harness his talents and bring forth his vision, both to the set and the world.Losing his father at an early age gave him the intrinsic principles of good work and proper application of his talents—talents that Shaun embraced and gave him the drive to start working at the young age of fifteen.Using Basketball as an outlet to gain mental discipline and Zen-esque clarity, Shaun found it within himself to walk the path of the creative man. Writing being one of his passions, his poetry was published at the prodigious age of seventeen for the magazine Creative Communications. When acting, his characteristically vivid smile, compelling charisma, and intense introspection have made him renowned as an actor malleable to any role. Shaun has years of experience in the modeling circuit of Los Angeles; he has worked on campaigns for Curves, Lost Clothing and a myriad of others.Recently, Shaun Gerardo has finished shooting for Criminal—a film directed by Denzel Whitaker, starring Robbie Amell (NBC's 1600 Penn), Kevin Phillips (Red Tails), and Noel Gugliemi (The Fast and the Furious, Training Day), in which he had a cameo and worked as a Co-Producer. Another of Shaun’s films, currently in Post-Production, is Clock Out, featuring actor Bill Oberst Jr., a film that paints a world of gray morality with stunning lucidity.Shaun’s upcoming release is “Alpha and Omega 2” (Lionsgate), which is set to release in September, where he is cast as “Rogue Wolf #1”—this is his first Voice-Over release this year. Production for another project, \"The Dooms Chapel Horror\", has finished, where Shaun plays a Documentary Filmmaker named Tanner..Described as showing “…vulnerability, strength, sincerity and realism few Oscar-winning actors display”, Shaun Gerardo is an artist of striking depth and relentless capacity for progress.\n  \n  \n",
