While there, I tested a wireless node selection algorithm on a large scale wireless test bed called ORBIT as well as parallelized a python script across a cluster that data mined packet capture files from the ORBIT tests. I used Git as version control for iterations of the python script and ORBIT tests. I presented my results at the end of the summer to the faculty, PhD students, and other undergraduate researchers."
