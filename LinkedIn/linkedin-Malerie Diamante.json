While my strengths are in Ideation, Strategy, Analytics, Coaching, Sales, Event Planning, Team Building, Recruiting and Management, I was born with a passion for both math and art and although I'm thankful I didn't follow my one dream to become a math teacher, I'm still on the path to including that and art in every part of my career.  As a Fine Arts major with a concentration in Glass Art: Stained Glass, Neon and Glassblowing, I couldn't figure out how I was going to make a living as a glass blower on the east coast, so I spent some time working at Disney World and fell in love with guest service which prompted me to change my major and graduate with a BS focused in Hospitality Management and Business from The Ohio State University.  Now I am in the desert, living out my dreams, working with the most incredible clients and people in the creative, marketing and advertising industry, while still always pursuing my side hustle as a true artist!\n  \n  \n",
