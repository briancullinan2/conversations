After working her way up the ranks, she left the company to work with other industry pioneers, starting an agency that helped create and grow many of the online marketing capabilities and services many people currently take for granted, until acquisition by Ogilvy. For the past two decades, she has served as CEO of a consulting firm that works with both agencies and brands, in the areas of PR, social media management, compliance services, and other web-related activities, serving clients nationally from five locations, serving clients such as Banana Republic, WebMD, General Mills, Sears, Publicis Groupe, LG, British Airways, Sanofi, and many more. As an expansion of that agency, she also founded 3 Peas Baby Product marketing - a firm that specifically services the juvenile product industry. And most recently 3 Peas Baby Gear Rental which rents high-end baby gear to those traveling to Arizona and connects juvenile brands to affluent parents. Amanda is a published author (she wrote “PR in a Jar” was a contributing author for “The Social Media Bible”), Columbia University MBA grad, and frequently speaks at events. She's a Founding Member of GABERCO - the Global Association for Baby Equipment Rental, and actively involved in many Boards.When she’s not out being a pink Porsche driving Pug owner known for her snark, Amanda is seeking new opportunities for investment or growth. Or awaiting a crazy acquisition or dream job that she just cannot refuse (like being Victor Newman's daughter on the Young & the Restless.)\n  \n  \n",
