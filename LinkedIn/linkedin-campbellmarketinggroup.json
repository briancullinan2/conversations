        "summary": "    One of my passions has always been small business. My goals include assisting small businesses in developing a solid and affordable social media marketing programs - I do so through Campbell Marketing Group. With CMG, my long-term goal is to be able to assist a small business anywhere in US as we've already worked with clients out-of-state. From my experience working as a Social Media Specialist for a major auto manufacturer, I addressed complaints that were posted on Social Media - via Facebook or Twitter - and handled as necessary to re-establish customer satisfaction. Additionally, I addressed any potential sales lead via Social Media - located the prospects and directed them to their local auto dealership. Today, I create content for my clients' social media aimed towards earning likes, comments and shares. At CMG, we \"create conversations about your business\" and, in doing so, expand your reach and influence in your market and industry. And we can customize a program for your business across many social media platforms - including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, YouTube and, of course, LinkedIn. Each day brings a new challenge and learning experience. And if you're not taking care of yourself mentally, physically, financially and emotionally, then you're selling yourself short. Go after your dreams and aspirations and outwork your competition. That's what I intend to do.Visit our social media:Facebook page at Facebook.com/CMGSocialMediaMarketingTwitter at @CMGSocialMedia1Instagram at @cmgsocialmediaGoogle + and YouTube at Campbell Marketing Group And our website at www.cmgsocialmedia.com\n  \n  \n",
