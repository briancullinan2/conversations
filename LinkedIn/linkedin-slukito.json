                "My name is Nmuta Jones; I've served as a technology teacher / professor for a total of over 10 years.  I've taught hundreds of students and I've seen many people come through various programs and climb through various rigorous obstacles in order to graduate and eventually succeed. With that said, I can comfortably say that on behalf of my entire teaching staff at Galvanize, Shu Sia pretty much floored everyone with her performance, overall technical aptitude, grit, determination, and problem solving abilities. Shu Sia's ability to write and understand software is remarkable.  Over the period of six months,  I witnessed her not only get through all of the \"base\" and \"stretch\" goals that we presented the students in the Full Stack web development curriculum, but on top of that Shu Sia put together some of the most breathtaking projects from the very beginning of the program all they way to her final presentation at the end. Shu Sia's final capstone presentation had the strength of 4 capstone presentations rolled into one.  She integrated web sockets, Node js,  React, postgres,  a VUI with voice recognition / language processing,  great design, and several other features that constituted an amazingly robust app having only had 10 days to put the whole thing together. As amazed as I was, I wasn't surprised. This is what it had been like with Shu Sia from day one of her enrollment in the program. I remember the first week looking at student submissions in our learning management system and next to Shu Sia's name was a continual stream of green checkmarks all the way down the row.  Always passing tests, always quietly aggressive and winning, always smiling, joyful and happy , and a joy to work with. This level of achievement and discipline continued steadily over the next six months. As of November 2017, (this month), I HIGHLY recommend Shu Sia for any senior level position in web development or for a Solutions Architect position.  Her ability to ramp up to unfamiliar environments will not disappoint. Shu Sia delivers, is consistent, reliable, steady, and a very positive , team-player kind of person. She's very driven but also collaborative and is always willing to help others which would make her fit really well in either an Agile shop or a shop where she's a lone wolf coder working on her own.  The discipline is there, the accountability is there,  the passion is there... it's difficult to think of anything that she doesn't do well.  Shu Sia is very well rounded and technically strong.
