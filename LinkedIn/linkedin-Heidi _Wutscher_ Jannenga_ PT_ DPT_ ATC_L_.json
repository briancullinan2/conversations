        "summary": "    As the President at WebPT, I lead product vision, branding efforts, and company culture. After recognizing the need for a more sophisticated industry-specific EMR platform, I co-founded WebPT in 2008. Since then, I’ve guided the company through exponential growth, while garnering national recognition. Before launching WebPT, I practiced as a physical therapist for more than 15 years, specializing in extremity post-surgical rehabilitation, ACL prevention programs, and sport-specific training. Eventually, I became a multi-clinic site director for the Tempe, Arizona-based company Physiotherapy Associates, a nationally recognized orthopedic outpatient physical therapy facility with a sports emphasis. I obtained my DPT through Evidence in Motion, completed certifications in manual therapy from the University of St. Augustine, and earned certifications in athletic training from the National Strength and Conditioning Association.Today, I am an active member of the sports and private practice sections of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and an advocate for independent rehab therapy businesses. I was appointed to the PT-PAC Board of Trustees in 2014, and in that position, I advocate on behalf of the APTA and our profession as a whole. Additionally, I speak as a subject-matter expert at industry conferences and events, leveraging my platform to promote the importance of women in leadership, company culture, and overall business acumen for rehab therapy professionals. I also serve as a mentor for physical therapy students and local entrepreneurs as well as a board member for Support My Club and Tallwave, where I have the opportunity to share my experience and passion for healthcare innovation and use my collaborative leadership style to empower others. \n  \n  \n",
