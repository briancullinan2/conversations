At PADT \"We Make Innovation Work\" by helping companies that make physical products by providing them the engineering services and tools they need. Everyday I get to work with smart employees, interesting customers, and fantastic vendors.Those are the basic facts, read on to learn more...The official bio:  Eric Miller is a co-owner of Tempe based PADT, Inc., where he is involved in providing tools and services to companies who design and manufacture physical products.  He holds a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley and has lived in Arizona since 1986.  He started his career focusing on the application of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computer Aided Design (CAD) to simulate turbine engine components.  Over the years he became recognized as an expert user of the ANSYS software tool and in the development of custom software to automate the product simulation and design process. As a co-founder of PADT in 1994, Eric was able to also pursue his interests in IT, graphic design, additive manufacturing, database programming, and small business management.  As both PADT and the use of advanced engineering tools grew, Eric became exposed to dozens of different industries and developed his broad understanding of the application of technology for product development and manufacturing.After over three decades in the industry, Eric is often called upon to write and speak on simulation, design, and 3D Printing as well as on startups and the high-tech sector.  His involvement in the startup community includes angel investing as well as mentoring and serving on steering, screening, and advisory boards of a variety of technical organizations and institutions.  In his spare time Eric enjoys traveling, history, cooking, running, and learning about new things.\n  \n  \n",
