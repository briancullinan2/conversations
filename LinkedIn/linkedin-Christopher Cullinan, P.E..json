Politeness when your neighbor's curt. It's deafness when the scandal flows. And sympathy with other's woes. It's loyalty when duty calls. It's courage when disaster falls. It's patience when the hours are long; It's found in laughter and in song; In the silent time of prayer - In happiness and in despair. In all of life and nothing less, we find the thing we call success.",
