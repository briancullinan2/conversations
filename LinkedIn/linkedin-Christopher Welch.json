The company was founded originally to integrate filmmaking, both as a fun after-school enrichment activity as well as a serious, academic program to engage kids using current technologies.  The goal is ultimately to create linkages between young people throughout the world, using the internet to bridge cultural divides and to provide them tools to collaborate.The company was funded from revenues generated by selling to schools and corporate sponsors and  some outside capital (convertible bridge financing) to fund development.Like with any start-up I wore multiple hats: raising capital, arranging financing, overseeing operations, implementing sales and marketing systems and oversight and business development."
