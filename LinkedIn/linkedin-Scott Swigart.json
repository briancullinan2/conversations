No doubt about it - deciding to work with Cascade Insights early in the process of ramping up a new CI function was the single best decision that I could have made.   There are a number of things that stand out:  1.)  The quality of the competitive analysis that they completed for our company was the best we have ever seen - that is not an exaggeration.  We were used to seeing large excel spreadsheets come back with large amounts of data, but relatively little analysis.  Scott delivered a large, well thought out analysis that was actionable.   Scott also delivered the content via a presentation to a wide audience within our company.  Even though that analysis was over 6 months ago, I still receive unsolicited, positive feedback from others in our company on the work that he did for us.    2.)  I needed some assistance in driving CI awareness in my company.  I worked with Scott and Sean to develop a high level agenda.  Sean then came on-site and delivered an outstanding training to a multi-disciplined audience (tough crowd).  Cascade Insights did more to help drive home the need for CI in our org in 1 day than I could have done in 1 year by myself.   3.)  Cascade Insights has also provided a temendous amount of assistance in getting our CI team off of the ground.   They provided 1 full day of consultation with my team - their advice has proved to be exactly what we needed.  They have really changed the way that I think about competitive intelligence and has helped me focus my team on what is important.   There is no way that we would have matured as quickly as we have as a CI team without their help! I consider Scott and Sean to be working members of my CI team.  They are always willing to pick up the phone and chat, provide helpful links, resources and guidance.  They are easy to work with, professional, and very responsive.  They understand the high-tech industry and the challenges of developing a CI function in a large organization."
