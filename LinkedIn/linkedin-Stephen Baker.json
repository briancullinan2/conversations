He carries a very sound and thorough understanding of the intricacies of software development; and he has a talent for being able to sniff out problems before they do indeed, become problems. In working with him for 2 years, I found that Steve requires minimal supervision, the quality of his work is superb, and his ability to maintain an even-keel through the toughest of meetings and projects showed his 'lead by example' nature. I can only hope to have the opportunity to work with Steve, or anyone like him, again in my career."
