I began to produce alcoholic spirits for personal enjoyment and also experimented with a new approach, for the rapid aging of spirits through the use of charred woods, temperature, and pressure. I created, innovated, and implemented the standard process for this aging method and filed for a patent. Through the use of this process, I created new whiskeys aged with woods that could not normally be utilized by traditional means. I developed the product labeling, bottling style, and packaging in accordance to federal regulation, from concept to market-ready product. I obtained federal and state licensure for production and sale and was invited to be a founding member of the Arizona State Distillers Guild. www.Baskdistillery.com"
