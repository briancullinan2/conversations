                "I've been speaking to audiences for over 13 years and professionally for the past 6. It's been an epic journey from being a shy kid on a tiny island in the Pacific to speaking in front of audiences of up to 6,000 people. I’ve shared my story with people from all walks of life from middle school students to CEOs and seen lives impacted by my message. I’m humbled every time I step on a stage because I know that it’s only by God’s grace and an irrational passion to help others write their success story and dominate in their life, career, and business that I am where I am today. And the best part is…I’m just getting started! I’d be honored to deliver value at your next conference or event. For info about booking me to speak, visit AJAdams.biz/speaking",
