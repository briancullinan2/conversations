My primary focus from 1997 to 2012 was Sales Engineering; I would answer \"what do you do?\" with \"I'm the geek on the sales floor,\" serving as a technical consultant during the pre-sales process to help clients determine the appropriate solutions that fit within their budget.In 2012 I moved into WordPress development, and with my background in Object-Oriented Programming I quickly carved out a niche as a back-end developer, diving deep into the WordPress standards and APIs to craft custom solutions.  I've done a great deal of work leveraging and customizing common solutions such as WooCommerce and BuddyPress, integrating seamlessly into custom designs.In my time in development I've also worked with a host of third-party APIs including Salesforce and Google Maps, as well as some occasional work with Drupal 7 and Magento Commerce."
