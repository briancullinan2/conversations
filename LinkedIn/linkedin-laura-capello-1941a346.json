As a nonprofit agency, we really couldn't have both but we were in desperate need of both of the skill sets the positions provided. I never thought I would find all those qualities in one person and figured we would have to just decide what we needed more, that was until I met Tami Zale. During our interview, it was apparent very quickly that she was a very qualified finance person, but as we talked more, I realized that she also possessed the qualities we needed to oversee operations and Human resources. While she had spent her career in the for profit sector, she had the passion for the nonprofit community and now wanted to share her years of experience with a organization she believed in. She started at our agency on April 1 and has worked alongside our leadership team in guiding us in a new direction. As a new CEO, I have counted on her years of experience in leadership to help me be more strategic in our development and fundraising. She jumped in head first and was able to catch us up on our financials and give us the information we needed to move forward. Her experience has brought our agency to a new level and I look forward to working with her and taking our agency to great heights."
