Their expertise is industry agnostic yet geared to your specific needs as a business owner. As a soon to be business owner, you can't imagine all the things that you need to consider with setting up, yet wIth Hopscratch, I was able to get every foundational license and program that I needed so I could stay focused on the vision. Jonathan and his team have assembled a 'business in a box' and they made the whole process so seamless from effortless logistics to powerful tools. Every person on the Hopscratch team was incredibly accommodating and fun to work with and I highly recommend Hopscratch and their methodology.
