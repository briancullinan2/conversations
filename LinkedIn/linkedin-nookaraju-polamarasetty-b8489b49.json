                "I worked with Vinay on several SBS, ESM, Confirms & letters related projects at Charles Schwab (Infosys Ltd). I found Vinay to be an outstanding IT Manager and Technical Test Lead. Vinay's leadership and organizational skills have lead him to receive laudatory remarks from superiors, peers and subordinates. I have always enjoyed working with Vinay on any project that he has control of; the projects are well managed and on-time. His enthusiasm, energy, and positive attitude helped make him successful and very highly regarded by all clients he worked with. I recommend Vinay very highly and would welcome an opportunity to work with him again."
