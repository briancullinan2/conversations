I have proposed projects to Dan and each time he has been very receptive and open to my ideas. It's a credit to his leadership ability that he is willing to listen to new ideas and develop those ideas into a plan of action as long as it is beneficial to everyone involved.I have tried to emulate Dan's work ethic as I admire his ability to not only lead the ever-growing Sports Media 101 network, but still continue his duties as the editor of Giants 101. Despite his attention being divided between Giants 101 and Sports Media 101 as a whole, Giants 101 continues to provide the best coverage of the New York Giants you can find.I have the utmost confidence that SM101 will continue to grow under Dan's watch and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone. It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Dan and I am looking forward to what the future holds."
