I'm well versed in web technologies, cyber security, self-driving cars, user experience, and product and process design.As the CTO and Co-Founder of 5 different ventures I've worn many different hats: programmer, manager, strategist, comedian (didn't get too far on that one). As a result I have a unique set of skills that allow me to tackle the hardest of problems. But actual life experience has taught me the following:* Your job doesn't have to be boring, tell your co-workers some bad jokes whenever they are needed. * Also tell them some bad jokes when they are not needed.* I don't care who gets the credit, I just want to win.* I have big ideas.* Most people have big ideas.* But execution is what matters. And I do execution.* I run towards firesI love meeting new people, reach out if want to talk about technology or business.P.S. If you know how to beat the rainbow road from Mario Kart 64 please get in touch as soon as posible!\n  \n  \n",
