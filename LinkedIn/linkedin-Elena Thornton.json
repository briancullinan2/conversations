        "summary": "    Since 2007, the Arizona Consortium for the Arts has carved out a distinctive role among the region's thriving arts and cultural institutions as a unique organization. One of the best known and most prominent projects is the highly acclaimed The Blue Guitar Magazine, noted for both its quality and its range. It is a literary and arts journal/magazine. It features Arizona emerging and established writers and artists. The Blue Guitar has drawn state-wide submissions and has thousands of readers in Arizona, throughout the country and abroad. We also publish The Blue Guitar Jr. Edition, which features works by children and works by adults who write for children. In the Summer of 2012, we launched the inaugural issue of Unstrung, a magazine of, for and about poetry. Rebecca Dyer, the co-founder and Editor-in- Chief of the Blue Guitar Magazine was one of the nominees for the 2012 Governor’s Arts Awards. Another popular programming is the Consortium’s annual Blue Guitar Festival of the Arts. The Festival features our local musicians, dancers, singers and readers from the Magazine. In addition to promoting a wide range of programs in the visual, literary and performing arts, The Arizona Consortium for the Arts maintains a varied and growing portfolio of weekly programs, projects and services for artists, audiences, and collaborating organizations. Arizona Consortium for the Arts, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit, all volunteer, community organization. The consortium's vision is to establish a multicultural, multidisciplinary arts space/center with an open door policy. The center will provide a home for all activities and foster artistic growth for people of all ages through the participation in the arts. It will be a home for many wonderful community organizations and groups, creative and innovative activities and projects representing and celebrating our diverse community. www.artizona.org\n  \n  \n",
