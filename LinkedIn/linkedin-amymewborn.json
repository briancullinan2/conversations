        "summary": "    Amy started her finance career at American Express, while finishing her finance & management degree at Valparaiso University.  She began her first national securities education program–a Series 7.  When Amy left American Express to move to San Diego, she was advising over 600 families on how to grow & manage wealth.At Superior Planning, a boutique multi family office, her financial focus became family business owners, with an average net worth of $10M to $40M. She has worked with the Ford dealerships, Vinturi Wine Aerator, and multiple tech companies to help manage, grow, & distribute wealth.Amy carries a Series 7, Series 63, and a prestigious Series 24, to be a managerial supervisor of national securities dealers.  Her most prestigious finance training is her Certified Financial Planner certificate – a five year advanced training that includes Financial Planning, Investment Advisory, Tax Management, Insurance, & Estate Planning.  Amy received her first fitness certification with  Kore Pilates.  Although she loved pilates, she knew that for her, that path didn’t make financial sense.  She loved the method, but didn’t see appropriate profit margins to justify leaving a six figure finance career!  When she found barre, she loved the transformation in her body, but was really drawn to the financial strengths of a barre studio.In addition to being an up & coming fitness discipline; its low start up costs, low ongoing maintenance expenses, & the ability to teach 15–30 people in a class, made financial sense.  Her desire is to help women create & manage their own profitable fitness businesses – providing freedom to leave the corporate job they hate to have more time & money to do what they really love!Amy has been featured on - CBS, Fox, The WB,  KUSI, San Diego Magazine, Ranch and Coast, & iVillage.  She is a contributing editor for the Carmel Valley Life & a certified continuing education provider for the American Council on Exercise (ACE).\n  \n  \n",
