                "Frank Lloyd Wright called the Kiva at Taliesin West a “desert playhouse.” He described it as “solid masonry inside and outside, with a sunken fireplace and an outside hangar for our cinema to peep in through the thick stone wall, arrangements for feasting and music. A triumph of imagination by way of simple form and limited space in the heart of a great cubical masonry block.” Info taken from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Wright’s “desert masonry” is really showcased here more then any other location at Taliesin West (in my humble opinion)",
