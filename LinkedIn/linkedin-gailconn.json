        "summary": "    I am first and foremost a creative and integrated thinker.  I’m also a very keen observer with a unique attention for detail and aesthetic.  I see everything as connected.  I read everything and am a junky for information and knowledge.  Connecting the dots summarizes my work with brands and clients. My experience enables me to apply perspective and context to a broad spectrum of ideas, relationships, problems, groups and organizations.  People make the world tick and having intuition about people is the most important quality a person can have.I find that working in small, nimble organizations gives me much more flexibility and opportunity to do quality work that really makes an impact.  Within these dynamic and fast moving environments, I’ve become very adept at integrating the right mix of personal priorities that keep me inspired, with the skills sets and organizational discipline required to achieve objectives and produce results.In my present incarnation as the CEO of PhiPower, a cutting edge online market research company, I am active in the day to day business and very hands on with our clients.
