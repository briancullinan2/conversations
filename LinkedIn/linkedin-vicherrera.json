During this time Vic primarily handled system administration, storage, and backups for the corporate systems running our organization.  These systems spanned from production to lab environments for software development teams.  During this time I found Vic to be dependable, knowledgeable, and always willing to “go the extra mile” when required.In addition to having an excellent work ethic and technical skills, Vic is also a great person to work with on a personal level.  He handles stressful situations in a way that puts everyone around him at ease, which is a welcome trait in an industry where urgent situations are not always an uncommon situation."
