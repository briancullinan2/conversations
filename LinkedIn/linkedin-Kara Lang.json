She is a fierce competitor whose work ethic is amongst the best I've seen in any sales organization. She is quick to pick up on coaching and has developed into a well rounded salesperson who understands the entire process of a deal from prospecting to close. I really enjoyed having Kara on my team and know that she'll be an excellent asset to any organization she chooses to be a part of."

In that time I had seen her not only excel at the core elements of her job as a sales development representative -- but also take on other tasks that extend well beyond the scope of her role, which is no surprise that she was promoted quickly into the sales organization as an account representative. What makes Kara so good at what she does, is her ability to communicate effectively and efficiently in order to get the job done. She goes out of her way to make sure that customers are taken care of, and she never hesitates help others on her team. This combination of productivity and being a team player explains why everyone loves working with Kara. She always came into work with a great attitude and a smile on her face and was an absolute pleasure to work with. I have only optimistic predictions for her career trajectory, and no matter the company, wherever she is they are most certainly lucky to have her."
