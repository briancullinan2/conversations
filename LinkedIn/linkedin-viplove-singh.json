Yes, I do this unapologetically, but not at the exclusion of my advocacy for all  students, regardless of gender. My recommendations on here come from women and men alike. Anyone who truly knows me knows that I am first, a mother of two boys and that I entered into a career in higher education to open doors of opportunity for ALL people and I have done that in the thousands over my 17-year career. It is difficult to be mischaracterized, but less so when you know yourself well. I hope that everyone can feel free to have open dialogue about the issues that affect them most.",
