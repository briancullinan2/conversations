How Michael Jordan became the king of basketball. How Armstrong landed on the moon.  And how Elon Musk built Tesla and SpaceX. I approach life with a core belief that anyone can accomplish anything. That not only can one man or woman make a difference, but that itâ€™s one man or woman who often makes the difference.My mission and my purpose is three-fold: to empower those who are committed to living a life by design; to be the absolute best at my craft; and to do all of this while having fun. I have started, built, ran, and sold several successful businesses. My first \"business\" venture was currency trading at the age of 11 in Albania. It gave me a taste of negotiating deals with \"sharks\" 4x my age and since then I fell in love with deal making and negotiating. I'm currently working to bring clean solar energy to the world, and to build a successful company by hiring and building successful people.I value freedom, courage, leadership, wisdom, and a good sense of humor. My strength is my commitment to growth. My weakness is Nutella\n  \n  \n",
