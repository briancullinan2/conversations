His assertiveness and desire to take on a leadership role in meetings was most impressive. His ability to effectively communicate his ideas to others while offering guidance and feedback is also a great strength. Mike is able to see the big picture but is not afraid to focus on details to help his strategy succeed. I consider myself fortunate to have worked with him this past year and hope our paths will cross again in the near future."
