        "summary": "    While leading digital marketing campaigns for 7 of the largest nationally syndicated talk shows, Todd Hartley knew that something revolutionary was about to happen online. Looking at his analytic databases of 20 million viewers per show, Todd noticed that video vastly outperformed all other forms of web-based media.And this was back in 2003, way before bandwidth could comfortably handle video.Embracing the power of video early on, Todd has spent the last decade mastering video marketing. In 2010, he created WireBuzz to help businesses amplify sales, reach marketing goals, and dominate the competition with video.Today, Todd focuses on staying 2 years ahead of his industry. To share what he’s learned along the way, Todd hosts Video Marketing Mastery, a weekly podcast that is dedicated to helping businesses find success with video. A leader in internet marketing, he also speaks at marketing and technology conferences on topics such as: Where Google is Going & How To Position Your Business To Profit, How to Leverage Video to Amplify Business Goals, and How To Speed Up Sales Results.Perhaps his most telling critique may be from another respected industry insider:“I have never met anyone as knowledgeable about video as a marketing secret weapon as Todd Hartley.”Mark Traphagen, Google Guru\n  \n  \n",
