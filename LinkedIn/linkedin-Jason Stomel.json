You have to go the extra mile and find the diamond in the rough. So I go to GitHub. GitHub search has a hidden feature which lets you search for users by code language. Search for “Node.js” or “Full Stack Engineer” and you’ll see user results (off to the far right) based on commits (contribution of that code to their profile). Once you’re there you can even do an advanced search and include location.",

I’m not going to email every single person. I’m going to find someone who is passionate about similar subject matter, reach out and say we should talk. That’s the extra mile, taking the time to learn about them before even sending an email. Because you shouldn’t be recruiting, you should be building a team.
