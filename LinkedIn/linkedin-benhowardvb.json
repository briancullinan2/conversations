He never wasted my time, always returned my phone calls, and worked hard to fill our gaps in staffing - often in other areas of our firm beyond the typical audit and tax positions.  He was the only recruiter that I worked with that looked at our firm as a whole, not just a company that did accounting.Ben was also remarkable for his honesty.  He would tell me the strong points of a candidate as well as the possible drawbacks, helping us to fully ascertain their qualities.  This resulted in few, if any, bad hires.  I would not hesitate to use Ben again, and more importanly, I have recommended him over and over, to other firms need his services as well as candidates looking for an honest recruiter."

                "While I was the Firm Administrator for the Phoenix office of Moss Adams (and its predecessor firm, Epstein, Weber & Conover), I had the opportunity of using Ben's services as a Recruiter.  He quickly became the Gold Standard of what a professional recruiter should be doing.  He took the time to learn what kind of candidate would be successful in our business (twice - the cultures were different between MA and EWC), and only presented candidates that he felt would be a fit.  He did not do what most recruiters do - throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.  He never wasted my time, always returned my phone calls, and worked hard to fill our gaps in staffing - often in other areas of our firm beyond the typical audit and tax positions.
