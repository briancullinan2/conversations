Ryan has gone into code sections of complex financial logic that nobody else wanted to even touch and improve performance by several hundred percent as well as cleaned up the logic to where it was easy for other developers to understand and maintain.  In addition to his technical knowledge, Ryan has an understanding of financial systems that sets him apart from the rest.  He is able to work well with those around him and is a dedicated employee.

During that time Mike continued to innovate and improve upon one of the industry’s leading distributed software trading systems.  When it comes to the exchange facing services, his knowledge is unparalleled, and quite frankly an irreplaceable asset.  Michael was at the forefront, always available before market open, and eagerly looking to help in any way to make sure that Charles Schwab’s exchange facing software solutions were not just working but working at their optimum.  Michael is quite skilled in developing bulletproof, flexible, innovative software solutions.   For example, Michael’s solution for an exchange simulation application was to generate something that would be easily updated and extended using methods other than code change.  Anyone in the industry knows that exchanges in the market are in constant flux, so finding a solution that didn’t require frequent code changes was necessary unless you wanted a full time employee working on code changes.  His solution was also beneficial in that it allowed our QA department to easily manipulate the exchanges messaging from the UI to more thoroughly test our trading system.  This is a rather simplistic example, but the point is that Michael is constantly looking to generate software that takes in all the variables and adjust the solution to find the best possible fit for the situation as a whole.Michael places his work and business ethic above all else.   When others would look for a software solution that would get them home by 5pm, or a solution that kept them working on their proprietary technologies, Michael was looking for the best solution for the company and his co-workers.I would work with Michael again in a heartbeat.
