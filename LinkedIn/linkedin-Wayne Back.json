        "summary": "    Growing up on a 7000 acre ranch in Northern California , I feel I'm in the perfect field! I love the transportation industry & running heavy equipment, yet at my job I don't have to get as dirty as working on the farm when I was younger. I learned a lot from my Dad working with him about business management & equipment preventative maintenance. I have many hands on mechanical abilities, with a can do attitude and a touch of MacGyver! I cultivate a positive productive and energetic atmosphere with my staff in the environment at MRD, and therefore my passions are fueled. Since 2003 I have been on the Board of Directors of Stepping Stone of SD. With my special events background I have been able to be very useful in fundraising and development. Many hours of joy go into this worthy cause and my friends in recovery.\n  \n  \n",
