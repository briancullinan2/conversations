This includes backend monitoring, data management, communication layer, user interface and company website -including back end systems for orders, installations and licensing.  Technologies:  Visual Studio 2010, WPF, WCF, Expression Blend, Expression Design, SqlServer 9, LinqToSql, LINQ, .NET 3.5, .NET 2.0, NUnit, Log4net; Snoop  and Cruise Control.Net.  I am very comfortable writing XAML with or without designer mode or Expression Blend and modifying creating styles and control templates.Products:Nstrument Manager - A Client/Server network monitoring application providing real-time monitoring and reporting for your network infrastructure.  Includes ticketing for when thresholds are exceeded and completely integrated network tools like Port Switch Mapper, Trace Route, Trap Sender and Receiver, MIB Browser and WMI Browser (all written by us in C#/WPF) to aide in trouble shooting.  Client/Server Communication utilizes WCF and Network Monitoring utilizes ICMP, SNMP, WMI and HTTP.  The User interface has over 100 User Controls and uses the Avalon Dock Layout Manager, MS WPF Toolkit, a custom Chart Control and heavy Data Binding to make use of WPF.  The user interface also utilizes Async operations to keep it responsive, settings to remember user actions and has a rich WPF look to set us apart from competitors.SNMP Library / Free MIB Browser - The .Net SNMP Library sends and receives UDP packets for those wishing to write their own SNMP programs.  It is multi-threaded, exposes an Async API and uses strongly typed objects so you can use LINQ to query them.  The free MIB Browser is a scaled down version 1 of the Nstrument Manager MIB Browser.  It provides basic read only Gets, Table Walks and includes over 1200 MIBs."
