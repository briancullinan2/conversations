Originally a mid-1960s model 147, it had been Frankensteined and MacGyvered until it was barely recognizable inside. George was able to diagnose the problem(s), rebuild the components - electrical and mechanical - and make it safe and reliable. Now it's one of the best 122/147s I've ever heard. Great communication, attention to detail, bedside manner, and excellent problem-solving skills are part of the the George Fish package. He's truly an amazing local resource."

                "George rescued a deeply troubled Leslie speaker cabinet I had found for my church's Hammond A-102 via Craigslist. Originally a mid-1960s model 147, it had been Frankensteined and MacGyvered until it was barely recognizable inside. George was able to diagnose the problem(s), rebuild the components - electrical and mechanical - and make it safe and reliable. Now it's one of the best 122/147s I've ever heard. Great communication, attention to detail, bedside manner, and excellent problem-solving skills are part of the the George Fish package. He's truly an amazing local resource."
