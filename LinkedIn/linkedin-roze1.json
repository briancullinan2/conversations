He desire for excellence made it too easy to work with him. He could take direction to a tee or be left to his own method of execution - both resulted in a fast, safe and beautiful rigging. He prides himself it his work and it seriously shows. Neil really proves his value half way through a shoot when the exhaustion just starts to set in and he is still working with enthusiasm. His love of the film set is infectious. He reminds why this job rocks."

        "summary": "    I have been making films since 2002 and have developed a unique cinematic voice that has helped build a strong reputation among professional and bankable actors. My dedication to the work has allowed me to build relationships and networks to finance, distribution, international presales and talent attachments.  I have worked with a variety of production budgets and feel confident in delivering a professional product under any financial circumstance. Below you will find links to my work. I have carved out a strong niche in the horror and art house genre and I have built a fan base behind my work.Today my earliest films, All Dogs and M.O.M. are part of the curriculum at some of the most  prestigious film schools and fine art colleges in North America.  The short films I did ten years ago are finally getting me work with gritty ad campaigns like Venomocity’s anti-smoking PSA’s. You will find those below as well. Feel free to reach out to me if you are looking to attach a director to your project. I am currently reading scripts.\n  \n  \n",
