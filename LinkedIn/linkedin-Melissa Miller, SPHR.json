My team is making fans of our employees even BEFORE they start working with the company by providing great service with great attitudes! I'm excited to see improvements made in our process to onboard the best talent in marketplace.  I love the conversation that my employer, Express Scripts, is fostering about how to make prescription drugs safer and more affordable.  As the landscape of healthcare in the U.S. changes, I'm proud to be part of a company who wants to advocate for good changes which benefit both payors and patients.  St. Louis is home for me, and I am active on the St. Louis County Workforce Development Board as well as in local parish and school boards.  We have a talented group of professionals in this community, and I encourage anyone who is interested in relocating to check out the area.\n  \n  \n",
