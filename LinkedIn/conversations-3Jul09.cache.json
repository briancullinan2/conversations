    "message": "Dear Brian,\nyou can has recz! \nSorry, I meant to send this out before when you asked but instead kept this draft in a textfile for a month because I lost connectivity right before sending it.\n\nDetails of the Recommendation: \"Brian is a highly detail-oriented applications developer with a particular gift for seeking out difficult program bugs and eradicating them. He prides himself on valuing “function over fashion” in regards to the software development process. I can tell you, though, as his team leader in a collaborative User Interface Design project: He has an intuition for usable design. I've been notified by our professor, Dr. Eck Doerry, that our group's Final Usability Analysis Project is handed out to future students as a prime example of creative design, effective analysis and good old-fashioned follow-through. It's been a pleasure working with him.\"",
