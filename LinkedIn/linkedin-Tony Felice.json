Sometimes you just want someone to come in and fix everything. Or you need someone to evaluate what's wrong and make recommendations for improvement. I've owned an agency for 10 years and I've been helping companies be successful for more than 35 years.  I've been in business for myself long enough that I know what it truly takes to have staying power. I've seen my clients industry's go through so many things (recession, changes in consumer buying habits, pressures from the internet, etc.) that inform the choices we make for them. I've seen almost every gimmick there is and I know how to help you navigate one of the most complex systems: marketing.  My proven, proprietary method will transform your business and make your brand more competitive. My multiple decades career has taken me from the halls of the U.S. Congress to Hollywood California. I have worked on public policy, strategy and media relations for large multi-national corporations and small businesses alike. I've launched more than 90 brands in my career. Marketing is a systems problem requiring a scientific approach and elegant solutions."

Tony is not just incredibly creative, he exemplifies integrity and has built an amazing team around him that possess these same rare and incredibly valuable qualities.  I have absolutely no trepidation in highly recommending Tony and TFPR to any company... they move mountains and make it look effortless.  I have referred many colleagues to TFPR and every one - without exception - has personally reached out to thank me for introducing them to Tony.  Final thought - I simply cannot imagine not having TFPR an integral part of our business endeavors."

I have the brain of a scientist and the heart of an artist.I've been in business for myself long enough that I know what it truly takes to have staying power. I've seen my clients industry's go through so many things (recession, changes in consumer buying habits, pressures from the internet, etc.) that inform the choices we make for them. I've seen almost every gimmick there is and I know how to help them navigate one of the most complex systems: marketing.  There is great power in the words we choose and the images we share and the story we tell. I get to do that for a living. That's incredible.My multiple decades career has taken me from the halls of the U.S. Congress to Hollywood California.  I've has worked on public policy, strategy and media relations for large multi-national corporations and small businesses alike.  I've launched more than 90 brands in my career.Appointed by Mayor Stanton, I'm a member of the Ad-Hoc Committee for FastTrack Cities, I'm a member of the American Institute of Architects Phoenix Advisory Council. I volunteer as Communications Advisor to Phoenix First Lady Nicole Stanton for her Dion Initiative, I'm on the Leadership Team of Focus On Lyme, an Officer of Local First Arizona's C(6) Board and I sit on the Pride Grant Advisory Panel for Arizona Community Foundation.  I was previously on the Board of Directors, Phoenix Art Museum Contemporary Art Forum, Chair and Vice Chair for the GPGLCC and I served on the Small Business Leadership Council of the Phoenix Chamber of Commerce.\n  \n  \n",
