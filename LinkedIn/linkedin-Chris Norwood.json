Having been around the block a few times, he sees things a little differently than most and can cut through a lot of the BS that can bog down a project or a campaign.With almost a dozen years of experience at the helm of several design and marketing studios, his resume includes a diverse mix of clients from community foundations to Fortune 100s. And while not a designer, his ability to walk the line between strategy and creativity helps our clients understand the process and more importantly helps our creative team understand the needs of our clients.Prior to opting for the desert in 2008 Chris founded and operated Dragonfly Communications, a marketing and graphic design studio in Washington, DC for 10 years. Before that, he worked for several DC-based advertising and public relations firms. Chris graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and a minor in Creative Writing."
