                "Kore1 (www.kore1.com) is a full service recruiting & consulting company in the areas of IT, Sales & Marketing Communications and Accounting & Finance. What separates Kore1 from our competitors are the relationships we have with our candidates and our reputation for exceptional follow up and customer service.Kore1 is ranked as one of the fastest growing companies in the Country. Recent accomplishments are as follows:• 664th fastest growing company in the Country (INC. Magazine, 2013)• 27th fastest growing company in Orange County (Orange County Business Journal, 2012)• 21st fastest growing company in Orange County (Orange County Business Journal, 2013)In a recent study by Fortune Magazine over 65% of an executive’s time is spent on human resource responsibilities including interviewing, hiring, and eventually management of those individuals that are hired. This should not be surprising as every successful executive understands that the key to his or her success depends heavily on the quality of the team they build.Talent can be divided into three categories: “A”,”B”, and “C”. Have you ever interviewed a candidate and they showed great enthusiasm, passion, and a deep desire for the job only to be hired and fade quickly into mediocrity? Ask any executive or hiring manager and they will have numerous stories they can share with you. A warm body is NOT better than nobody. Hold out for the \"A\" players and build a winning team.We are respectfully selective in the companies and resources that we choose to partner with. Our objective is to match “A” companies with “A” players. “A” companies want to work with only the best talent and “A” players want to work with only the best companies. As a result we have built a client and resource base that is one of the tops in the industry.To learn more about our recruiting and workforce management solutions and pricing visithttp://www.kore1.com"
