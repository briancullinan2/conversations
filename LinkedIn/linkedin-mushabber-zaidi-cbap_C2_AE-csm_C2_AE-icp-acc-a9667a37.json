Life is all about living your journey where the destination and the path taken are unique. Bill Gates started creating an operating system and so does Steve Jobs. Windows and Apple are totally unique in their way. We all are unique beyond comparison. Our thoughts are different, our actions are different, our ways, our pattern, our behavior, our reactions etc etc is totally unique. Do not ever compare you and yours with anyone else. You are hurting and insulting yourself by doing so. No two things into the world is same. What are you going to do when a sense of comparison arises within you? Not everything works for others works for you. Find yours. #SayNoToComparison #PeopleAreUnique",
