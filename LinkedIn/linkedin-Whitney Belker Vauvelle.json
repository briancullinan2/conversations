After I completed the CIJ Workshop with Whitney I was inspired to create my own creativity workshop and got clear about the next steps I wanted to take in my personal and professional life. I also started to collaborate with another CIJ participant in my class and fulfilled one of my dreams to record music at The Hit Factory in Miami which is one of, if not the most prestigious music studios in South Florida. This would not have been possible without me being in the CIJ class. Whitney is the real deal. She is 100% dedicated to her students success and she is an absolute gem to work with.
