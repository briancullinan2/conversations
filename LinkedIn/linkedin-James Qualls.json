I pride myself in being as efficient as possible, and I am always looking for new leading edge ways to improve my workflow and technical skills.Though my biggest passion is technology, I am a musician and a music buff. The first thing you will notice is I always have my headphones in.I am eager to continue learning, adopting, teaching, and leading.\n  \n  \n",
