                "I’m writing in praise of Shawn Doyle. I know Shawn via his expert participation in the Rational discussion forums. He consistently shared wise responses, sometimes to issues that vexed others. His focus was ClearCase, ClearQuest, Build Forge and the underlying foundational CM concepts. He is articulate, knowledgeable and seems to enjoy helping folks solve their problems.From his online persona, Shawn is a first class fish in this IT sea of Rational tools. I feel great recommending him highly.Yours, Marc Siegel, online community manager"
