She needed to not only hire and help develop our internal staff but she was also expected to grow our customer base.  I am pleased to say that Gena has done a very good job in both of those areas to date.  I highly recommend Gena as a proven account manager.  She is very creative and consultative in her approach and Gena really takes the time to understand her customers and their needs.  Gena would be a great partner to anyone looking for someone that genuinely takes the time to understand them and their business."
