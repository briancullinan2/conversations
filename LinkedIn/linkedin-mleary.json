Besides his welcomed sense of humor, he is an awesome recruiter and a great client manager at all levels.  He was integral in helping us scale the hiring fast.  He would do whatever it took to help us achieve our goals and personally picked up challenging positions in EMEA and APAC where there was no support.  Mike was an important strategic contributor in helping us build a business and staffing function globally.  He had a significant impact and was a strong leader for the team.  He was a sounding board when I needed to think through our options.  I learned a lot from Mike and hope I get the chance to work with him again."
