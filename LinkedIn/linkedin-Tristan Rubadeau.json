What you come to understand is that Tristan is one of those rare developers who approaches his craft from a business-centric, entrepreneurial perspective — his considerations are more ‘what is the best solution to benefit my client’ rather than ‘what new technology do I want to learn?’ His thoughtful approach to requirements analysis allows him to look past what the business wants and addresses what they need. He is a solid developer who is also interested in all aspects of the life cycle, with a knowledge of agile processes and team development practices, he is not just ‘full stack’, but rather ‘full process’.
