The tournament participates in a tagging program for Marlin and Sailfish.Boats are sponsored by either a company or an individual. Teams are one to four anglers. There are lots of ways to earn points and many awards – some you may not want and some you definitely want! We run a pledge campaign – every team signs up backers – every boat is a winner for charity.Read the back story of how the tournament came to be. Then take a look at the tournament. If you love to fish and want to head to Cabo for a good cause, sign up as a sponsor!

He combines a strategic vision with a tactical sense of the possible - both guided by years of experience in successfully building companies. He has been relentless in his search for a solid value proposition for Metro and very creative in building that proposition and the strategic relationships which will support it. He goes beyond his commitments and seems dedicated to always exceeding expectations. I would recommend him to any CEO looking for senior, experienced advice."
