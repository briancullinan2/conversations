I had a phone interview and an in person interview with \nJason Simpson - Manager, Internal Software Development\nKent Gott - Senior PHP Developer\nAdam Shankel -PHP Developer\nI never heard back from any of them after I sent a thank you letter. Has the environment at GoDaddy changed so drastically that they would want to hire a genuine talent like myself?\n\nI have been developing software since I was only 11 years old. I started in VB4 and explored .Net since it's inception. Later I honed my skills on the web with PHP and JavaScript. I enjoy all forms of software development and computer administration. In previous positions a 6 month salary review has worked well, as it gives us both a chance to show what we are made of, without breaking the bank. I have a lot of experience with start-ups, so I am no stranger to bringing new products and technologies to market in a controlled environment. I would enjoy a change to meet more of the team. For reference, I would be looking in the ballpark of $180k. Thank you. \n\n-Brian",
