The first day of orientation he walked in as the head of education doing amazing yo-yo tricks and established the expectations of what it was like to be a student at his school. Dave made a lasting impression on me that day, it was August 26th, 1996. Fortunately, I not only graduated, but was hired as an employee at the University during my sophomore year. Several years later and for about 10 years after that, Dave was assigned to be my mentor. Year after year, he helped me take a new perspective on life and work, worked to cultivate my ability to balance work, personal relationships and health, write, lecture, lead and challenge all of my ideas so that they could be tactically and practically implemented. Dave is highly intelligent, well read and committed to continual improvement in his programs. I am grateful to have had him as my mentor as I grew up in the world of higher education and at the game of life."

                "Dave first made an impression on me as a college freshman. The first day of orientation he walked in as the head of education doing amazing yo-yo tricks and established the expectations of what it was like to be a student at his school. Dave made a lasting impression on me that day, it was August 26th, 1996. Fortunately, I not only graduated, but was hired as an employee at the University during my sophomore year. Several years later and for about 10 years after that, Dave was assigned to be my mentor. Year after year, he helped me take a new perspective on life and work, worked to cultivate my ability to balance work, personal relationships and health, write, lecture, lead and challenge all of my ideas so that they could be tactically and practically implemented. Dave is highly intelligent, well read and committed to continual improvement in his programs. I am grateful to have had him as my mentor as I grew up in the world of higher education and at the game of life."

Throughout his time with us, Bron cultivated a presence and reputation for being someone who was thoughtful, trustworthy, constant and a presence who bonded diverse teams together.  Through his calm and caring demeanor, Bron was quite good at helping individuals as they worked through difficult projects and the occasional conflict. His success with teams is helped by the intelligent wit that Bron uses to lighten the mood and tempo of work when such a break is needed.    As a final point, Bron’s ethics, commitment and treatment of others are beyond reproach. I truly hope that you consider Mr. Stadheim in a positive light as you evaluate candidates.
