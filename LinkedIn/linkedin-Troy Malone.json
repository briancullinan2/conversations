                "Ji Young is an amazing PR professional and has done a tremendous job for Evernote in Korea. She is always full of great ideas and has the ability to execute and make them a reality. It felt as though Ji Young was actually part of our Evernote team in Korea. That's a very rare but highly valuable relationship to find with a PR professional. I would highly recommend Ji Young to anyone looking to make a large impact in the PR world."
