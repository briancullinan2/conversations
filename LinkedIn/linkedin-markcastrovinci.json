        "summary": "    With the successful sale of Legacy.com I am excited to be looking for my next challenge.  I am a technology leader and executive who partners on product and business vision to design the technology strategy to get there.  I lead the efforts to improve upon existing systems or entirely reinvent them.  I have worked with many technologies but a sampling of the most recents ones include Amazon cloud, microservices, Docker, Docker Swarm, QA automation, continuous integration/delivery, JavaScript frameworks, NLP/Machine Learning and others.  I have extensive experience running operations in addition to the software development organization.  Data has been a very exciting part of my career.  I’ve seen data warehouses go from using a relational database, a reporting package and overnight batch processing to today’s explosion of data creation requiring solutions like Hadoop and Netezza to wrestle what is now called Big Data.  This creates a massive challenge for collecting huge amounts of data at fire hose speed in order to make today’s real-time site and business decision making.  I also have proven practices for driving product and engineering schedules using Agile Scrum and Kanban processes.  I am interested in joining a startup to get things off the ground or as the lead technologist of an established company looking to move faster with great reliability and scale.\n  \n  \n",
