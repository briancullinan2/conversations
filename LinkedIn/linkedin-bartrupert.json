        "summary": "    Known for delivering results where strategy meets execution, my expertise includes business leadership, rapid corporate growth, operational efficiency, sales & marketing, deal negotiations, emerging technologies, and effective P&L management at companies ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500s.I am particularly skilled at growth acceleration, company turn arounds, and corporate transformations. I have enjoyed the challenges of repositioning businesses and optimizing opportunities to achieve organic growth, accelerate business development, and prepare for M&A events. Throughout my career I have successfully led and built technology companies focusing on software development, healthcare solutions, oil & gas, and, most recently, solar energy. I thrive in environments where I can deliver targeted revenue and profit growth and shareholder value even in complex, mission-impossible situations.Projects we can discuss include transforming a product or company, achieving rapid growth within a specific market segment, revolutionizing or optimizing business strategies, embracing disruptive trends across industries (such as the booming growth of renewable energy and the impact of solar & wind technologies for utilities), driving revenue, managing rapid growth, tools for streamlining business tasks, ways to create positive & lasting change, and others. The general theme I tend to follow is growth & transformation, both personally and professionally.
