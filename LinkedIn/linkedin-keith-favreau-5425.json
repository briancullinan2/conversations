I have observed Keith in several difficult situations where client expectations did not necessarily match the scope of the project.  One of Keith's strengths is his ability to communicate with clients and help them understand product roadmaps.  At the same time, Keith is able to pick up on critical nuances that clients require and push for these to be incorporated in product development.  Keith is a strong advocate for clients, but at the same time he recognizes the delicate balance between their needs and his own organization's mission and strategic vision."
