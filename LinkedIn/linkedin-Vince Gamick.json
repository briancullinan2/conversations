She is the epitome of a self-starter who will tackle new and challenging tasks with zeal.  Due to the high pace of the work we performed, I was constantly throwing Irina into roles that were both varied in scope and difficulty.  Additionally, the work regularly came with seemingly unrealistic deadlines and with high degrees of pressure for both thoroughness and accuracy.   Without fail, any time we internally quality controlled her deliverables or when our clients audited work, Irina’s work product consistently was beyond reproach.  In addition, Irina's ability to coordinate the efforts of her subordinates and her management of outside service providers was thorough and with consistent follow-through.  Overall, her skill sets allowed me to completely hand-off projects to her and I could trust they would be completed accurately, on time and the client would be thrilled with the outcome."
