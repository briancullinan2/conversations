Sean onboarded me when I joined Faronics and later I had the opportunity to work with Sean in a couple of in-house and cloud migration projects.

Sean's diligence and interpersonal skills made it easy for him to work will anyone in the organization from the C-suite to the front line. He would not hesitate to state the obvious - good bad or ugly to ensure all stake holders were aware of what needed to be done.  Sean is a knowledgeable administrator capable of managing any network deployment scenario.  His cross platform experience and knowledge with Linux / LAMP / Windows servers is phenomenal. He is the go to guy.  Sean was responsible for managing all internal servers, PBX - phone systems,  Security Monitoring and Authorization, Migration to Hosted Services,  Management of Exchange Servers & eventual Migration to Cloud Services.  Sean also mentored the Desktop Support staff who's primary role was managing internal user issues. Additionally Sean negotiated and managed Vendor Contracts & SLA's as well as Internal Stakeholder SLA's.Sean is at home in any technology and I would not hesitate to recommend him for any role he he feels capable of challenging."
