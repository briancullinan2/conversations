I founded, grew and led Javelin Strategy & Research, now a Greenwich Associates LLC company, and volunteered on the board of the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau).  I also started the financial services research practice at Jupiter Research--since acquired by Forrester--and was a product manager for five organizations from startup to Fortune 500. I've been in digital commerce since graduating college, helping merchants, banks and tech providers find or implement ways to succeed. Perhaps you've seen one of my talks or media quotes? I've presented before the US House of Representatives, FDIC, House Ways and Means Committee, countless industry events, and my comments have been covered on TV, radio and print media. My personal passions include sustainable alternative transportation and connecting with new cultures. \n  \n  \n",
