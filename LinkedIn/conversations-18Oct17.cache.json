The quote from Abraham Lincoln particularly caught my attention.\n\nAre you suggesting I need help not confirming I'm a fool? Is this what you'd like to help me with? Or are you looking to help by using AI for recruiting?\n\nThanks,\nSarah\n\n\nI am particularly interested in building a recruiting function.

By asking questions I help recruiters learn about me and in turn learn what is important to them. It was more in reference to my own practice. But that is a sign you took it so personally ;) What is your experience with recruiting software?",
