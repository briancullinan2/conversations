You need to be intimately involved in the job description (I write mine) and agonize over every “requirement” and make sure you agree with each. But also very important is to meet frequently with your recruiter and just talk. Remember that they represent you when talking with candidates, so you need to equip them to put your best foot forward.",

And sad to be leaving Microsoft Research; there is nowhere in the world like MSR and it has been an honor to be part of the lab for the past eleven years. But our core mission of expanding the state of the art, rapidly transferring innovation, and ensuring a vibrant future has become increasingly fundamental to Microsoft as a whole, and I look forward to applying what I have learned at MSR in my new role.",
