                "September 19, 2014, Chris managed Bruce directly",
                "I hired Bruce to be Modular’s very first Global HR Business Partner, as part of a major shift from a mainly US-focused HR department to a truly global shared services group.  Bruce thrived and delivered excellent results as we found our way together in designing and delivering a wide range of new strategic and operational services to managers and employees in the “Americas,” the part of the world he was assigned (the largest part, with 2/3 of the company’s headcount).  Bruce was at his best when given a new program to design and implement across borders, requiring him to make use of his strong business, innovation, consulting and relationship-building skills.  I was always impressed when I accompanied Bruce to international locations and saw that managers and employees acted like he was a colleague from the same office because he had invested so much time cultivating genuine relationships over the phone from the US.  The trust he was able to build allowed him to gain critical access to information during gnarly employee relations investigations, even though he was working with people virtually and over the phone.  Besides Bruces’s skills as a global HR generalist, he’s also a fantastic trainer and facilitator.  He meticulously prepares for his training events and other group interventions, which gives him an immediate command of the room and goes a long way in creating value for all stakeholders involved.  Bruce is also one of the most globally-minded people you’ll meet.  His language skills come paired with a cross-cultural awareness that is essential to succeed in any global business environment.  I’d hire Bruce again in a heartbeat."
