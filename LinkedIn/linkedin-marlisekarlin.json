        "summary": "    Marlise Karlin is a mindfulness expert, author, and entrepreneur with a colorful past. Once a teen runaway on drugs, she went on to become an award-winning film producer before developing a groundbreaking meditation technique — SOS MethodTM  that develops calm, focus, and wellbeing in just minutes – even if the mind isn’t still.Marlise has been interviewed by NBC and Fox News; her work has been published on AOL.com and Forbes.com; she’s written two books; and she’s toured globally to sold-out audiences.Marlise’s unique credentials include a position as International Director for an NGO,  where she met with business, political leaders, and celebrities globally; and as National Director of Break the Cycle, where she created and implemented strategies for empowering youth — all of which laid groundwork for the extensive humanitarian outreach in her future.When Karlin’s career as a film producer ended from a serious injury it led her to refocus on her personal healing journey. The challenges of growing up with an alcoholic, abusive father — and the stress-related illnesses this caused — sparked a lifetime pursuit for discovering new solutions. More than twenty years of research and study with teachers from diverse fields — masters of meditation in India and experts on holistic traditions in Japan — led Karlin to develop SOS MethodTM, a proprietary mindfulness technique. In essence, SOS is meditation reinvented for the modern world.For over a decade this science-based mindfulness method has helped people around the world. Stressed out millennials in the US, victims of abuse in Africa, overworked professionals in Asia, and wellness-seeking seniors in Europe have all found the strength needed to face life’s many setbacks and the inspiration to create a future filled with possibility. In the midst of an increasingly divisive culture, Marlise is a visionary entrepreneur who’s committed to creating a kinder, more conscious world. \n  \n  \n",
