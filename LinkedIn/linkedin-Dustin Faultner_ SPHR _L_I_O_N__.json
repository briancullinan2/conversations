In stressful circumstances Erik has an uncanny ability to maintain a positive attitude and motivate those around him to stay on task. He has the best interpersonal skills that I have come across in a long time. He is very professional and structured, yet makes anyone feel comfortable and open to him. Detail-oriented, effective, and passionate about his work. His innovative energy, attention to detail, and customer focused attitude insure requirements are tailored appropriately for each of his customers. If I were building a \"dream team\" for my most important business venture, Erik would most certainly be a part of it. On top of all of this, he’s a hell of a fisher-man. In short: Employers love him, Employees follow him, & Fish fear him."
