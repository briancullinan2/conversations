One of the things I miss about Kate was her willingness to jump in and help with a smile. She is very efficient and with her attention to detail she took on more work projects than was required or expected and did a superb job. On her annual reviews, she always came in with high scores. Kate was a pleasure to work with and I would recommend her in any field!Phill"

Mandy has worked many roles in her real estate career including my transaction coordinator, an office manager and now Associate Broker. Every role has been met with excellence, over achievement, great attitude, good work ethic and a willingness to help those around her. For those looking to work with Mandy, you will enjoy her personality and be well taken care of. She is one of the best and I highly recommend her (no matter what role she works in)….
