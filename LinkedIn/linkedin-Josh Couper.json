                "Kris was absolutely incredible to work with. In addition to being a brilliant designer, Kris is an amazing individual who is truly gifted in her craft. I was able to work with Kris on multiple projects at Galvanize. She was always clear, kind, and compassionate in how she carried herself and interacted with others. You can immediately tell the amount of passion and creativity she brings to the table. She had to manage more design needs for the company than I could ever imagine. She successfully did so with an amazing level of organization and attention to detail. She’s sharp, creative, and warm-hearted. I truly hope I have the opportunity to work with her again."
