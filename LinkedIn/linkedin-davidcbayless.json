        "summary": "    I am a self-driven, creative problem solver/full stack software developer with a penchant for music, board and video games, armchair philosophy, reading, long walks on the beach, and bad \"dad\" jokes. Learning quickly is one of my strengths and I am eager to learn, adapt, and grow. As a developer, I thrive in collaborative work environments and seek out opportunities where I can mentor and be mentored. Additionally, I enjoy automating as many processes as I can and highly value DevOps ideals. Continuous integration, deployment and testing are all part of how I prefer to move through the development process.\n  \n  \n",
