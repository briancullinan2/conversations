        "summary": "    I have 27 years of progressive, C-Level executive leadership experience in for-profit and not-for-profit organizations across a variety of industries.  These include: healthcare, technology, education, financial services, steel, food, consumer products, information technology, government contracts, fundraising and ad-agency services.  I am also experienced in all aspects of company and brand acquisitions and divestitures from pre-deal due diligence through post-closing business integration.I have a proven track record of being able to successfully and simultaneously lead strategically while also being more than willing to execute tactically.  I can also lead functional areas outside of my core competencies including sales, marketing, new-product development, operations, human resources and logistics. My strength is in succeeding where others have failed.  I don't judge, I fix.  And then maybe, just maybe, I might crack a very slight smile.This allows the business leaders and owners I work with the ability to sleep a little better at night knowing I've got their backs.\n  \n  \n",
