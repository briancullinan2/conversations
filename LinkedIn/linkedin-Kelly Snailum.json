Kelly catered workouts to meet my specific needs and modified them through injuries and both times I have been pregnant.  I went from novice to advanced in a very short time with her.  She has upbeat, high energy classes that make you want to push harder to reach your goals. I love working out with Kelly and would highly suggest her to anyone I know. She is also the BEST with pregnant belly pilates...=0)"
