Now, every access point in the church, both wired and wireless, can only access filtered Internet.- Youth Pastor Wick, Father of 3Clean Router differs from most parental control solutions in that it’s a hardware device, not software. It can definitely do some things that are tough for the typical software-based utility. Clean Router can manage and monitor Internet traffic for every connected device. Of course, content filtering at the router level is browser-independent. In fact, it’s totally device-independent.—PC MagazineWe work with families, churches and businesses all around the world to protect families from the dangers of the Internet.  With new devices, game consoles, smart TVs and others, there has never been more access to pornography and other content that today.  Software solutions can’t cover all these areas, which is why we created Clean Router.Control screen time.  See email reports of Internet activity by device.
