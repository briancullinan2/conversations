                "I have known Shawn Reynold for the past ten years and had worked for him for 2 of those years.  Shawn was not only a great Manager, but I have also had the pleasure of getting to know him on a personal level.His interpersonal and communication skills have allowed him to develop productive working relationships with both our clients and his staff. Shawn is a resourceful, creative, and solution-oriented person who is able to function well under pressure, and still manage to be supportive and a leader to his team.Shawn has always been highly respected, as both a person and a professional, by colleagues, employees, suppliers, and customers alike.   I would work for Shawn again without hesitation!"
