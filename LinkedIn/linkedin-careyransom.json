The Internet has created fascinating new opportunities for business to deliver value, and consumers have more options and power than ever to influence, participate in and benefit from it.  As businesses create more purpose-driven and collaborative models, even more disruption to existing companies will occur.2. Small businesses are the fabric of our country's economy, and they drive the jobs, innovation and community bonds that we all seek. They need help to succeed and nothing is more rewarding to me than helping a small business/entrepreneur to reach a new goal or insight and gain a competitive edge (even if just temporarily), as well as provide better customer experiences. I'm an entrepreneurial thrill seeker and company builder.  I have a founder attitude, even when I join a business already underway, or take over the reigns of a company. I love to shape, strategize and invest in new ideas.  My areas of expertise are business and corporate development, technology and product strategy, marketing, sales and channel partner development. I've led many startup-to-growth companies to successfully pursue breakthrough business opportunities. I've done millions of dollars of business via LinkedIn as well!I enjoy change, new challenges and executing on new ideas; always seek bright colleagues in fast-moving, high-growth environments, where the future is ambiguous and unclear; thrive on undertaking strategic and intellectual challenges; and have a strong preference for highly entrepreneurial team environments and continuously learning and growing.Myers-Briggs Type: ENTPSpecialties: Building & Launching New Products into New Markets; Consumer Experience, UX/UI Design; Product Development; Digital Marketing; Programmatic Advertising;  Email & Social Media Marketing; Monetization & Cloud Business Models; Web Design & Development, Enterprise Sales, Business Development, Distribution & Channel Partners; Venture Capital & Private Equity\n  \n  \n",
