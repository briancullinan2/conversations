        "summary": "    Every year, approximately 20,000 students graduate from medical school in the US. They start their residencies, which can last from 3 to 8 or more years, with roughly $200,000 of federal student loan debt at an average interest rate of nearly 7%… and salaries of roughly $50,000.Needless to say, a resident’s debt rises in each year as limited liquidity forces reduced or no payments on their student loan debt. But newer (and proposed) federal legislation can not only help to put a tourniquet on this bleeding of accrued interest; it also offers loan forgiveness at certain intervals depending on their post-training sector of employment, overall debt, and annual income. I’ve spent the past 5 years serving as a resource to graduate health professional schools, teaching hospitals, and strategic partners to provide education to students and residents on how to navigate the student loan marketplace to maximize available benefits and reduce the cost of their debt. I managed a team of Regional VP’s who worked in total with over 50 medical schools and over 100 hospitals nationally in 2014 alone, and I’ve personally hosted over 400 presentations to over 20,000 soon-to-be or recently-minted doctors and other graduate health professionals.I'm a tirelessly dedicated student of the student loan legislative and refinancing marketplace today, with a proven background in forging long-term relationships with schools, hospitals and strategic partners to help students, graduates and members make the best decisions with respect to their student debt.\n  \n  \n",
