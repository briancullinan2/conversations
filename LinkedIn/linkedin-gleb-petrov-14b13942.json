I was impressed by how he sold the company to me, his efforts to work within the constraints of my timeline and how he went to bat for me when the time came.  He made the entire process easy: from first call, to interviewing, to negotiating and finally, getting me settled into my new position.  Gleb is an incredible first impression, and his easy going demeanor, winning personality, and the desire to help others achieve their career goals leaves a lasting one as well.  I look forward to working with him in the future, as he continues to knock it out of the park."

He is not only kind and funny, he was intuitive, thoughtful and really understands the process of finding/hiring new talent AND understands the industry we're in, which makes a world of difference. Too many times, recruiters don't really *get* the work that the people they're recruiting for do. He gets it. Gleb also asked me some of the best questions I've had on a first interview and none of the typical (read, lame) ones (i.e., never asked me to self-identify my weaknesses). He was also very thorough in setting my expectations at Left Field and quick in the hiring process. I can't say enough nice things about Gleb and I hope to be singing his praises for a long, long time. :)"
