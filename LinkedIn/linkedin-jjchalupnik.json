His primary task was doing creative research and development on a CG feature film project we have in development.  In addition to doing all he was asked on the research front, J.J. worked on his own time using Maya to create 3D look development elements.  J.J .is a diligent worker, he integrated with the rest of the team very well and was generally a great pleasure to have around the office.  I can highly recommend J.J. Chalupnik without reservation!"
