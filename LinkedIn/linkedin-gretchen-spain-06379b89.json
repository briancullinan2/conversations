Typically, recruiters are a dime a dozen; your LinkedIn inbox is constantly spammed by recruiters who treat you as a resource and not a person. Gretchen is different. The first time we spoke, she insisted on getting to know me as a person and goals outside of work before even talking about my resume, let alone the position she ultimately helped me get. Gretchen is an excellent negotiator, people-person, real, and trustworthy. If I were to ever seek new employment, she would be the first person I’d contact to discuss what the job landscape looks like. If you get the chance to work with her - take it. You won’t regret it."
