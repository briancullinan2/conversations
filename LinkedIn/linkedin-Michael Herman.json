I had the honor and pleasure of working with Michael in my role as Director of Instructional Design, and he remains one of my professional heroes. As a Lead Instructor, Michael demonstrated the oft-forgotten difference between ’telling’ and ’teaching’. He cared deeply about each student, maintained high expectations, and went above and beyond the call of duty to provide differentiated instruction. Michael was willing to do whatever it took to ensure each student reached their full potential. His efforts produced some of the strongest Web Development cohorts in my time at Galvanize. In his current role as Curriculum Developer, Michael helps shape the trajectory of the Web Development Immersive, producing high-quality blended materials that allow Galvanize to provide exceptional experience at scale. Galvanize is fortunate to have Michael.Outside of the classroom, Michael works tirelessly to give back to the software development community. He leads several Meetup groups that provide junior and senior developers alike the opportunity to come together and learn from each other. In volunteering this time, Michael models what it looks like to ‘pay it forward’ and be a steward of the profession. The Denver software community is fortunate to have Michael.And finally, Michael exhibits an insatiable appetite for feedback and personal growth that I strive to emulate. He models a ‘hacker’ mentality, never hesitating to jump in, make mistakes, and get his hands dirty. The growth mindset that he exhibits is the secret ingredient in education, and as he advances in his career and flexes his pedagogical muscles further, he’ll make a significant dent in the field  at large. The education community is fortunate to have Michael.I give Michael my highest recommendation and hope that our paths cross again soon. If you have the opportunity to hire him, don't pass it up."
