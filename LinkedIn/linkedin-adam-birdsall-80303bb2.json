It has exceeded 27,000 downloads and has generated revenue.I voluntarily developed Pi Kappa Phi Bike-A-Thon for a philanthropy event where people ride stationary bikes for 48 hours non-stop in order to raise money and awareness for people with disabilities. The app was made for people to sign up for 1 hour time slots to ride a bike. Over 600 people were able to use the app and the event was a success."
