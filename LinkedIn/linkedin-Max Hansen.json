Being friends, I obviously was aware of the work he performed and the services his company offered, but never had the need for those services until recently… My department was in need of 3-4 people to help with a systems integration project and with the potential to transition these people into different roles once the project was complete. I first addressed the need with my HR Dept and the director ensured me that she was capable of addressing these needs.  After more than two weeks my HR Dept had yet to identify even one qualified applicant.  With the project starting in just a few days I decided to call in some re-enforcements.  I contacted Max and provided as much information as I could to help him and his company in fulfilling our needs.  Max and his team tackled the project with confidence and a positive attitude.  The next day Max informed me that he had 4 qualified people all able to start @ 8am on Monday morning.  I was skeptical, but Max assured me that I would be satisfied with the level of talent these people possessed.  Sure enough, at 7:30am on Monday morning all 4 people reported to duty, accompanied by Max.  Each of the people performed above expectations and we ended up offering full time employment to each of them.  I have since employed Max's services two more times and have been 100% satisfied each time.  Thanks Max!"
