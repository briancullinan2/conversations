        "summary": "    I believe my natural leadership, management and technical experience helps empower highly effective engineering teams. This in turn means more efficient product development cycles, with fewer NRE costs. In addition, I identify and implement New Product Development Methodologies (NPDM) for hardware and firmware, allowing engineers to spend their time on value-add activities.I have extensive experience working and leading both highly specialized and multidisciplinary teams in wide-ranging high tech industries, from integrated circuits to highly complex systems  that include electronics, mechanical, motors, high vacuum, magnetics and high voltages. I am adept at managing multiple large-scale projects at once. For example, I led both hardware and firmware engineering teams through the New Product Development Life Cycle (NPDLC) of many highly complex electronics systems in very tight EMI/EMC specs. I consistently delivered timely/quality multidisciplinary technology products in these industries: •\tNuclear electronic systems, servo controls, automation and intelligent instrumentation•\tBiomedical electronics and systems•\tMixed analog/RF, ASIC/SoC and high speed ICs•\t and test solutions for These designs ranged from microprocessors/firmware/software integration, high speed analog to hardware/software for laser trim using Automatic Test Equipment (ATE).Specialties: Engineering/Project Management/team buildConcept-implementation-Multidisciplinary Electronic Systemconcurrent NPDLC/Lean Methodology/DFMA/Agile/ScrumLecture/support/sales/market/strategic-technology/marketing analysisMultiple Embedded micro-controllers development, Multi-tasking programming, RTOS.PCB Layout/High Freq/Low Leak/EMC/EMI/shield/Guard/Impedance ControlledHigh Speed/Mixed Analog IC/ASIC/Pin Driver/Comparator/Active-Load/PMU/DAC/ADC/Analog Mux/Instr.&OpAmp/SCR/TRIACS/Audio/Video/RF MixerLaser Trim/Sort/Final Test/package/ATE/ESI/CREDENCE/KVD/TMT/GSI-M310\n  \n  \n",
