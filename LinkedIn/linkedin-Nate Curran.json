        "summary": "    I love to make things work better.  I believe in constant iteration.  If you are not evolving then you are getting left behind.  My specialty is product development.  My definition of product development is to create a product that far exceeds customer expectations through the marketing, operations and technical development processes.  It's a no brainer that successful companies have all three of these in alignment.  It is much more difficult to roll up your sleeves and do it.I have over 15+ years of experience doing just that for Fortune 100 companies, fast growth start-ups and local businesses.  I have worked in diverse industries and with many diverse personalities.  In my career, I have grown startups, taken $100M businesses to $300M businesses and know how to do turn arounds.  I have made plenty of mistakes but never the same one twice.  My number one priority is to work with great people that are forward thinking and disruptive in their industry.  I think the entire organization feeds off of that energy and it makes what we do fun. I am not made to maintain the status quo and I try to only work with people that think that same way.\n  \n  \n",
