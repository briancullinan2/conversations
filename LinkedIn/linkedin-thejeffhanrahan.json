Our goal is to ensure that individuals live independently in healthy environments. Currently, many households across the US, lack the resources to provide and reside in environments that lead to positive health. We aim to reduce the need for poor health and eating habits, and keep people from falling back into a recycled system of prescription drug treatment. On top of the housing and healthcare services, we will also be training and providing job education for individuals in these living situations. Part of our program to help people back on their feet is supplying them with housing, by providing small, modular homes where medical professionals and our care team will check in with guests. Our organization plans to spend all of its time and resources to keep these resources operational, making sure that there is always a healthy home for those needing help. Our services will be available without charge to all individuals from the public who can benefit from the program and regain their health and independence. Sowing Resilience Communities is a not for profit organization, 501(c)3, and will maintain funding through individual donations and grants. If you are interested in learning more, or know someone who could benefit from a service like this, please reach out!"
