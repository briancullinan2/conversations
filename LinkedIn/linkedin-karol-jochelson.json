        "summary": "    Self taught Senior Software developer with 19 years programming experience as well as 15 years of business analyst experience. I find I have a high attention to detail which complements my programming and analytical skills. Through my working history I found myself being invited to many brainstorming sessions as well as strategy meetings. Most recently asked to be the head business analyst for our new CRM requirements analysis, process building and implementation process. Punctuality and time management has always been on top of my priority list, therefore increasing my average in achieving set goals and deadlines. I have always planned my projects in such a manner as to maintain a good work/life balance.Determination and ambition is something I don't lack. If faced with difficult projects or debugging problems, I never give up until I find a solution or find out that a solution does not exists. I am always open to new challenges and to learning new skills. \n  \n  \n",
