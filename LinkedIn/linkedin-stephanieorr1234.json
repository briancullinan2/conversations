For Casa, that person is Karen LaVorgna.  Six months ago, I met Karen when she presented me with her goal to organize a Casino night  to benefit Casa.  With our immediate approval, Karen hit the ground running chairing her March 11 Celebrity Casino night to benefit Casa.  She recruited her committee, scheduled planning meetings, secured the beautiful Wrigley Mansion as the venue, wrote letters soliciting silent auction items, prizes for winners, and raffle items. Karen also obtained numerous sponsors, supplying gifts for all their guests!  In addition, she and her committee solicited and received all donated appetizers from several generous Valley restaurants and grocers.  Karen topped off the evening with dynamic Matt and Ben from KNIX as MCs.   The event was attended by 300 very energetic people from Karen's extensive network of contacts and friends. The decor and atmosphere was electric and attendees raved about the event! At the end of the evening, Karen presented Casa with a donation of $15,000, which was exactly her goal! All who know her would confirm Karen is probably in the top 2% of energetic, \"get it done\" people.  Her follow through is unmatched and her commitment to meet her goals truly amazing. Karen's passion and determination to meet her goals allows her to accomplish anything she pursues. Casa is very grateful and fortunate Karen utilized her exemplary talents to raise money for Casa to prevent more children and teens from abuse and violence through our education programs!"
