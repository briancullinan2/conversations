'Participating in this drill is a great way for your organization to be prepared to survive and recover quickly from big earthquakes.' Needless to say we had a great success in our ShakeOut drill which was followed up with (milk)shakes for all of our employees who participated. Pictured below is two of the ice cream trucks we had on campus with lines showing how much of a hit this drill and the (milk)shakes were. Thank you to everyone who participated and to our Safety Committee and Seth Connors, for making this possible!",

We collected 1,886 items that went to teachers and students in low income school districts, providing valuable resources they may not otherwise have access to. This was the first time TFA San Diego collaborated with local companies to raise donations, and Mitchell FAR exceeded contributions from other participants. TFA was incredibly impressed with Mitchell’s commitment to supporting the community and so appreciative of our generosity. Thank you to everyone who donated!",

The Mitchell employees who attended the panel were given an opportunity to listen to these four accomplished women who shared how they deal with stress, balancing work and life, their journey in becoming an executive, and more.
