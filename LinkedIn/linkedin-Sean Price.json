From its inception in March of 2008 until April of 2011 Lucky Threads Apparel operated as a contract embroidery shop focused on catering to other local custom apparel shops. When my Rosati’s franchise was sold, I expanded Lucky Threads by adding screenprinting and heat applied embellishment techniques. Today it specializes in small business/organization branding needs, in the same way that Monster Shirts operated."
