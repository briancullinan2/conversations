        "summary": "    ---Introduction---I am a problem solver. My education and experience have taught me persistence, resourcefulness, structure, and balance. These qualities move me toward goals with a simple philosophy: if at first I don't succeed, I try again, and if that doesn't work, I try something else until I achieve the desired result.---Background and Strengths---The strengths I have developed are both technical and personal. I focused my education on mathematics and science, learning new ways of understanding the world around me. In particular, courses in statistics and finance taught me a robust set of skills for handling and analyzing data. This has driven my success over the past five years as a professional poker player and coach. As my professional career has evolved, I have worked with an ever-widening spectrum of supervisors, liaisons, colleagues, clients, and students in dozens of countries around the world. Interacting with many people in a variety of capacities has increased my ability to form strong and lasting social connections.\n  \n  \n",
