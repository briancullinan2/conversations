                "This month I conducted the 9th presentation of “My Journey Back to Life” to an audience of 200+ Carolinas Healthcare executives, board members, and physicians.  I am now coming up on the two year anniversary of a massive “Widowmaker” heart attack that nearly killed me.  I initially flat lined for 30 minutes and again for 10 minutes two weeks later, was kept alive for 5 days on an ECMO heart and lung machine, had respiratory failure, blood in the lungs, contracted pneumonia and CRE, went septic / had organ failure, severe pressure wounds, and was in a coma for five weeks.  I had a 1% chance of living.  When I came out of the coma, I had lost over 50 lbs. and I could only blink my eyes.  I had to relearn how to sit up, stand up, walk, and eat.  In total, I spent 2 months in the hospital and 5 weeks in rehabilitation before I could go home.  I then spent another three months in outpatient rehab and in the gym before I was able to get back to work.  This is a story of teamwork, fighting the odds, and grasping on to small amounts of hope in order to survive.   I give this presentation to inspire and teach others that great Teamwork instilled with Attitude, Focus, and Effort to can successfully fight any problem or obstacle in life.",

Against his competition, he is in a class by himself (I say this as someone who invariably can’t stand recruiters and find such a large number of them to be at a level of an unsophisticated realtor or outsourced mindless HR bureaucrat).  From the jobhunter perspective, Graham gives you: (1) a deep understanding of employers and their specific needs in a position, including what they are actually looking for and how they will test at every application and interview step for these needs; (2) a realistic, experienced appraisal of the kind of demand an employer can expect for a  position; (3) a deep insightful, experienced big picture of your job search and its key components (have never met a recruiter who can see the forest through the trees and articulate it like this); (4) an expert level understanding of the numerous key, common pitfalls for jobhunters; (5) a keen understanding of the right way to navigate these pitfalls, with a level of specifics, experience, and expertise that is tested and demonstrates itself immediately with superior results; and (6) a mastery of the application and interview processes, with astute insights regarding all of the key subtle components of those dances (that other recruiters definitely do not see).Graham has been a refreshing exception to my rule (based on extensive experience) of avoiding recruiters like the plague, primarily because he is more talented and clearly pursues a level of excellence well beyond his peers.  This is tangible and powerful in terms of providing strong positive results."

                "Graham simply understands his clients, their needs, and their world better than other recruiters, and is far more intelligent, perceptive, knowledgeable, and helpful -- with higher standards all around.  Against his competition, he is in a class by himself (I say this as someone who invariably can’t stand recruiters and find such a large number of them to be at a level of an unsophisticated realtor or outsourced mindless HR bureaucrat).  From the jobhunter perspective, Graham gives you: (1) a deep understanding of employers and their specific needs in a position, including what they are actually looking for and how they will test at every application and interview step for these needs; (2) a realistic, experienced appraisal of the kind of demand an employer can expect for a  position; (3) a deep insightful, experienced big picture of your job search and its key components (have never met a recruiter who can see the forest through the trees and articulate it like this); (4) an expert level understanding of the numerous key, common pitfalls for jobhunters; (5) a keen understanding of the right way to navigate these pitfalls, with a level of specifics, experience, and expertise that is tested and demonstrates itself immediately with superior results; and (6) a mastery of the application and interview processes, with astute insights regarding all of the key subtle components of those dances (that other recruiters definitely do not see).Graham has been a refreshing exception to my rule (based on extensive experience) of avoiding recruiters like the plague, primarily because he is more talented and clearly pursues a level of excellence well beyond his peers.  This is tangible and powerful in terms of providing strong positive results."
