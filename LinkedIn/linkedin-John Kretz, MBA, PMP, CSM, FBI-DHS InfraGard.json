        "summary": "    I am passionate about IT project management.  As a certified practitioner for more than 20 years I have seen the positive results as strong, mature PMO can bring to an IT department.  The past several years I have taken that passion and transitioned into PMO leadership positions, where I can affect change across a larger platform of mission-critical projects. I know what it takes to build a strong, successful IT Project/Program Management Office:* Talk Return on Investment with executives and senior leaders* Talk Strategic Alignment with Enterprise Architects and Business Leaders* Talk efficiency gains with mid-level management* Find and recruit the best IT project managers and Scrum Masters* Implement measurements, metrics and KPI's to show the performance and value of the IT PMO* Enable continuous improvement through feedback, active listening and Voice of the Customer\n  \n  \n",
