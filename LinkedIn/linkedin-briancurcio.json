        "summary": "    The topic of information technology is a broad one, spanning from help desk support to the Chief Information Officer, and each component plays a part in the company’s success. Throughout my career, I have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge across the board, working with industries of various sizes and disciplines to help them reach their objectives. While IT is where I hang my hat, my true passion lies in the bigger topic of business development and strategy. By reviewing and analyzing a company’s data as it relates to their network architecture, engineering, and operations, I can develop a plan that works. In addition to the expected business components, people are naturally a huge benefit to an organization’s success. I build teams of focused individuals who share the company’s mission and values and seamlessly support the systems and strategies we've put in place, leading to increased results.My focus on human capital does not stop with our internal teams; I develop strong relationships with clients as their advocate to ensure that they too achieve their goals. It’s a bit of a domino effect: create strong relationships internally with employees who love their jobs and then that just naturally flows through to our work with clients. Contact me to learn more about my experience and passion. I look forward to starting our conversation.\n  \n  \n",
