                "OK everyone, so it begins. My 7th #Movember. Our goal at DMC Atlanta is to raise over $50,000 for this amazing cause. The mission of Movember is simple: Keep Men From Dying Too Young. Everyone who reads this either personally has a prostate or testicles or knows and loves someone who does. Men suck at taking care of themselves, both physically and emotionally. Movember is about taking the stigma away from getting checked for cancer and seeking help for emotional issues that drive men to suicide. Please take a moment to think about your own health this month. If you haven't seen a doctor in the last year, get a physical. If you have a man in your life who is being stubborn about health issues, kick their butt a little. If you are in crisis emotionally or know someone who is, recognize that support can come in the most unlikely of places. Reach out. Talk to someone. Let's keep men from dying too young. Please feel free to reach out to me personally to learn more.",

        "summary": "    Adam Dorfman was born and raised in Atlanta and comes from a long line of entrepreneurs. ¬†He watched his father and stepmother build a company (APCO) from the ground up, and his childhood was filled with stories from his grandfathers about the ups and downs of building a company.Because of this, Adam became a professional musician and majored in English at Arizona State.Adam toured with the likes of John Mayer, Ben Folds, Alison Krauss, and Shawn Mullins before pursuing teaching in the Washington, D.C. area.Try as he might, he could not stay away from the world of business. He was a terrible employee, and entrepreneurship was in his blood. After a few years of teaching and restaurant work, Adam moved to Atlanta in April of 2002, took his first direct sales position in June, and, at the age of 25, opened DMC Atlanta in July of 2003 with a team of eight people.\"We built DMC Atlanta with the idea that anyone with the right work ethic, heart, and passion for success has an opportunity to own a piece of the company,\" a philosophy that has helped the organization expand to over 60 offices with plans to expand to 100 by late 2018.Adam still plays the occasional show but reserves most of his musical talent for the shower.\n  \n  \n",
