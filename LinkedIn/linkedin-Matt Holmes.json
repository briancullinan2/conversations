                "Jeff and I have worked together for the past 2 years, and in that time I have been able to get to work with Jeff on a number of opportunities and accounts on a regular basis. Jeff has the unique ability to uncover and communicate project and program requirements to both internal and external stakeholders. Coupled with the ability to think through and define impactful solutions on a tactical and strategic level, which he then is effective at communicating both visually and verbally. Because of Jeff's professional skills set and mindset, he has been a true asset to our company and would gladly work with him in his next position."
