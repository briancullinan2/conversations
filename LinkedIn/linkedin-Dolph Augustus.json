Dolph is to recruiting what a \"Full Stack Engineer\" is to engineering. He can work the \"front end\" by sourcing candidates amazingly. But it doesn't end there, he's equally great at the \"back end\" of the interview and hiring process treating candidates with white glove service and working extremely well with our hiring managers. Dolph represents the perfect balance of agency recruiting tenacity mixed with internal recruiting personal investment in the process and success for the organization. I highly recommend Dolph."
