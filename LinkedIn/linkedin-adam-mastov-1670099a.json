        "summary": "    I am currently an associate consultant at Sogeti working with within the cloud practice. I graduated from the Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering, at ASU, with a BS in ComputerScience and a concentration in Information Assurance. After graduating, I have done a littleprogramming on the side and developed a Chrome Extension to mute the Twitch media player when ads play. After my first year at ASU, I spent about 2 years working as aDevOps Intern at an open source company called KualiCo/rSmart. I worked on the company's main product, a grant management solution for researchers, called Kuali Coeus. I provided QA in the form of automated functional testing using the Selenium web driver, pipelined the process, and developed new tests based on user stories. Other notable projects were the production of data migration scripts, the development of a tool to visualize administrative hierarchies at universities, hosting applications on Amazon Linux and RedHat, and maintaining an internal Ruby on Rails app. During my senior year, I TA'd for an intro to programming section and was a section leader for two intro to ASU classes as well as completing my capstone with Tyler Technologies. I provided front end development usingAngular2 utilizing TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and a RESTful back end to create a state reportingtool for Tyler. At school, I learned service oriented architecture and application development using C#, .NET, and Visual Studio as well as many operational skills in my security classes. Inmy free time, I like to play guitar (somewhat badly), play with my dogs, browse Reddit, play ping pong with my roommates,watch Twitch, hang out with friends over VOIP, and play competitive video games.\n  \n  \n",
