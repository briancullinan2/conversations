Jennifer was a treat to work for."

                "I have known Steve for about 7 years as a former boss, and current mentor and friend. He has proven himself time & again as both a sensible source of wisdom, and a caring person. Steve is an excellent leader, organizer, problem solver, negotiator, manager, and has an excellent rapport with people of all ages. His communication skills, both written and verbal, are excellent.I am the owner of a Commercial General Contracting company in Phoenix, AZ and look to Steve on a regular basis for insight, advice and positive reinforcement. He has never let me down! He has garnered the experience and reputation to positively affect any situation and understand the interests and perspectives of all persons involved. I have watched Steve create for himself a very successful career; devoting himself to a great family, and to help build a successful and financially viable company. He told me a story once about a large public swimming pool that they had built that was not functioning as designed. He was doing everything he could to fix the problem, but a major portion of the pool was going to have to be removed and replaced, at a substantial cost to him and his company. But the words he told me regarding that situation are words that I live by to this day. He said that \"all that mattered was that the owner received the product that he had paid for,\" and that Steve \"didn't know what the problem was or whose fault it was, but the one person who wasn't at fault was definitely the owner.\" These words exemplify the kind of man that Steve is. In summary, I highly recommend Steve for any position or endeavor that he may seek to pursue. He is a valuable asset for any organization.If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me."
