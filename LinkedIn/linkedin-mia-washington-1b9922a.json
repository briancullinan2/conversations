                "I have worked with Mia Washington in her capacity as an Academic Counselor with the University of Phoenix.  At that time, I was a student and about to complete the Associate’s program.  During this time, I was stricken with Stevens - Johnson syndrome, and I called Mia while I was in the ICU Burn unit, to advise her that I needed to take a medical leave of absence from school.  Without any questions, she begin working on my request and as a student, I did not have any negative repercussions from having to leave school.  Mia was very caring, warm, and inviting in subsequent conversations concerning my health and ability to return to school.  Thankfully, I was able to survive the ordeal, within 90 days go back, and finish my education.  In a client-facing role, it is imperative to provide exceptional service.  In my opinion, Mia was a contributor to my success at the University."

I will never forget the day he called from the ICU in the hospital trying to get going again as soon as possible.
