That's where you come in. Through Benevolent, you can step into the story of a person striving to reach important goals by making a contribution simply, transparently and securely.On Benevolent, people tell their own stories and outline their needs. Here, helping professionals who know them validate the needs. Here, you can choose a need to support and give what you can.Join a flurry of donors coming together to move a roadblock for someone on the way to success and be a part of the solution for one person, right now.Our Benevolent ValuesWe believe in self-starters and want them to keep moving toward stability.We believe that strategic giving, even in small amounts, makes a substantial impact.We believe that when we act to do the right thing for another person, we are also transformed.We believe when we truly see one another, empathy trumps misperception. We believe that by transforming how we give, we create stronger connections and communities."
