        "summary": "    As a junior mechanical engineer, I tend to thrive in places where the projects spark my interests and I feel genuinely happy to go to work everyday. Being able to apply the theoretical knowledge I have gained to continually grow as an engineer is deeply important to me, so any candidate workplace must reflect that.My three years of employment at Western Digital have sharpened my design skills and my ability to work at vendor sights and overseas.While my hobbies within the performing arts have continued to grow my social skills and the experience of being a critical member on a team.So if I had to sum myself up in one sentence, it would be that I am a well-rounded, responsible, creative, and determined individual who is finding her place within the engineering industries.\n  \n  \n",
