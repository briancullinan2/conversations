        "summary": "    Born and raised on a farm in Brazil, I developed a passion for horses at a young age. It was there I learned how to care for and raise horses. I went on to earn a veterinary degree with a specialization in equine reproduction. In 2006, I relocated to Ramona, California to work with North Arabians. Specializing in horse reproduction, I’ve been fortunate to travel the world to work with clients in countries including, Belgium, Spain, Bahrain, Uruguay, Jordan, and Dubai.As a competitive reiner, I’ve earned a Reserve National Championships 2015 and in 2016 the National Champion title ––one of which was with a rescue horse who is now retired. Today I breed horses of my own, and currently have five with another on the way. Being this involved in the equestrian community eventually led me to create Galloper, a mobile app for booking horse transportation. Seeing firsthand how challenging it was to find and connect with reputable haulers, and then entrust the safety of your horse in that person’s hands without standardized protocols or a way to read reviews, I became impassioned to build a solution. Galloper became that solution. Now horse owners and haulers have an easy way to connect and arrange transportation.  \n  \n  \n",
