He gave me a checklist that was clearer than I’ve ever received before and I’ve had my own business computers for over 10 years. He included links for system checks over the internet, support link for product pricing, leading into my eventual purchase. He even included a copy of the appropriate service manual page for installing the product I needed to purchase, which was not lengthy at all and easy to understand. I feel totally confident in my decision due to his expertise and the best news yet – it was inexpensive. I would highly recommend Tim Bangert to anyone who needs service or product repair for software and hardware concerns. I will be a returning customer and avid referral."
