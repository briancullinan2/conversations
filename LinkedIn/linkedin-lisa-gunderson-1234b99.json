Lisa provides a fun, creative learning environment during her presentations and the students always remark that her session is one of their favorites.  Lisa is dynamic, fresh, energetic and caters her training to the needs of her clients.  I have heard Lisa speak about personality traits, leadership, management and self improvement.  Each time, I not only learned something about myself - I received mental tools to continue to make positive changes in my relationships both at home and at work.  Lisa is my 'go-to' professional when I need fresh ideas, facilitation and training materials."

This is a crucial session with the goal to make 20 people who don't know each other feel like a closely knit team and help them find the leader inside each of them.  Lisa nails it every time.  There are so many 'ah ha' moments - it's like watching lightening bugs all around the room when the light goes on at different moments for different people.  Lisa is not afraid to tackle tough issues and discuss them with the group in a way that makes sense.  Her creativity is amazing as is her energy level and her ability to connect to her audience.  I highly recommend Lisa as a consultant in teambuilding and leadership development!"
