                "I have had the pleasure of working with Bivas on several occasions when I hired him for some contract videography.  Bivas displays a professional demeanor and integrity that creates a productive working environment.  His skills are unmatched behind the camera and he also brings his own ideas to a project when asked.  He's on-time, communicates effectively and I highly recommend Bivas."
