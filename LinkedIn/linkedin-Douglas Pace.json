I had the opportunity and freedom to help improve the teams processes through new development, such as designing and implementing new tools that fully automated the process of configuring computers after they were imaged, saving my team hundreds of hours each semester when the computer labs were being updated. I championed and implemented campus access to services such as Mysql and Subversion giving staff and students access to tools that the central IT department already used to build projects. I started a code and security review process on my team that was expanded to include projects across campus and built coding standards that were shared and incorporated into groups around campus. I envisioned and helped design a technical method for automated processing of copyright complaints on campus saving hours of time each week to locate, identify and process each complaint."
