                "2) Recruiting is a grueling process - It took 6 months and several coffee and lunch catch ups with Patrick before I was ready to even consider a new role.  But Pat is a pro and has the patience of a saint.  Thanks for giving me a shot Pat :)",
                "3) Leap first and ask questions later; trust your gut - I knew absolutely nothing about LinkedIn or recruitment at the time, but I knew that I wanted to get into a SaaS sales position and move away from IT infrastructure sales.  Taking a new job or starting a new career is one of those things you'll never be 100% sure about.  Have some faith and if you're any good at what you do then you'll find a way to make it work.",
