                "I am a senior paralegal in a law firm in Phoenix. I have had the opportunity to work with a number of professionals from different domains of work and had the privileged to work with some of the best in their disciplines. It is out of this experience and the professional connection of several years that I strongly recommend Jason Hamann to provide excellent service in property management and protection. I have been impressed with his professionalism and perhaps even more impressed by his ability to satisfactorily handle complex matters with practicality, ease and candor. Jason is a bright, self-motivated visionary leader and serves as an excellent resource for clients searching for a company they can rely."

Jason learned this from being in the real estate industry, going door to door just introducing himself as the new neighborhood \"real estate professional\". Within the first 6 months at Russ Lyon he was a million dollar producer.Jason is no longer actively selling real estate full time, it's not because he wasn't successful at it but he wanted to expand his horizons within the industry. He is always trying to think out of the box and grow from other people's expertise.
