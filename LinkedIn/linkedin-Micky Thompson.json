Micky served as Post.Bid.Ship.’s founding CEO during which time he led the company through the important product development and go-to-market stages.

                "As I write this reference for Jarret, the companies we founded together, Post.Bid.Ship. and its subsidiary TruckItNow, are turning 5-years-old. Given that we started both companies during one of the United States’ deepest recessions in history, we are both very proud to have achieved this milestone. Next year will also mark the beginning of Jarret’s 3rd year as the companies’ Chief Executive Officer.As the prior CEO for the companies, I was fortunate to have Jarret serve with me as our Chief Operations Officer and member of our Board of Directors. During this tenure, Jarret showed great talent and leadership. As our COO, he was instrumental in the opening and growing of our profitable subsidiary TruckItNow, helping Post.Bid.Ship. win 2 innovation grants totaling over $370,000 as well as helping us raise over $2.3 million in investor funding. Also under Jarret’s leadership, Post.Bid.Ship. was named one of the top 8 most innovative companies in Arizona and again the following year one of the top 6 by the Governor’s office. We even received recognition outside of Arizona as Post.Bid.Ship. was named one of the top 14 Southwest companies by the Invest Southwest organization.  Since becoming CEO 2 years ago allowing me to spend more time with my growing family, Jarret has made smart moves including the relocation of the company to Phoenix, Arizona to be in a better position to attract top talent, aggressively grow our subsidiary TruckItNow and form valuable integration partnerships with other technology firms to expand the reach of Post.Bid.Ship.  There is a common belief among angel and venture capital investors that the best entrepreneurs are coachable and amendable and Jarret embodies those highly sought after traits. Jarret knows the importance and value in seeking wise counsel, surrounding oneself with smart people, actively listening, gathering feedback from all stakeholders, making a decision and sticking to a plan until new information that would alter the course presents itself. Prior to co-founding Post.Bid.Ship. and TruckItNow with Jarret, I was also fortunate to attend The University of Arizona MBA Program with him and work together as we completed the highly respected McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship Program as part of our MBA studies. Upon graduation, the thesis we created together as part of the program’s requirements would help us win The University of Arizona’s Best Venture Award our graduating year and put us in the position to officially launch Post.Bid.Ship. Two years after launching the company, Jarret and I were both honored to be named Southern Arizona’s Emerging Entrepreneurs of the Year for our work at Post.Bid.Ship.  In closing, I consider Jarret to be a great business person, talented entrepreneur, thoughtful person and close friend and I look forward to celebrating the many successes I am sure he will achieve over his lifetime."
