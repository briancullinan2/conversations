Time and time again she has proven to be a reliable problem solver and effective towards reducing costs and liabilities regarding my real estate leasing business. She is very easy to work with and flexible when it comes to different ideas to solve a problem. This year we were having turnover at the same time on 3 of my properties. April was successful in eliminating vacancy period completely in two of the properties and on the third, minimize the vacancy period as there was some work to be done on the apartment prior to the new tenancy commencing.
