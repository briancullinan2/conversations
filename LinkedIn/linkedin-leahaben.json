SmartFem Media Group evolved however our team and skill sets grew.  SmartFem Media Group is now a full-service digital marketing and advertising firm.  We have full service TV production, social media marketing service and website design and build services.  Our magazine SmartFem.com is still the number one online magazine for women.  SmartFem also has it's own SmartFem Entertainment TV show. It’s unfortunate but the sad truth that many companies fall short of the mark to deliver what they promise. We take pride in the fact that most of our clients have been with us for years.  We believe in excellent customer service and that you must stay cutting edge and on top of your game to compete in today's rapidly changing market.  We look forward to earning your business!"
