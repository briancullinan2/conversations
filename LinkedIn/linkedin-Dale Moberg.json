                "I worked with Brian Gibb at Sterling Commerce during the late 90s. At that time I was concerned with B2B protocol and system development for secure and reliable communications. Brian was supportive of these efforts within the corporate structure, and recognized that new approaches to network cryptography would make authentication and data confidentiality available.
