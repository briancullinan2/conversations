For example, when developing the content for our upcoming Lunch & Learn seminar, he helped guide the materials to not only be informative for the audience, but also created a call to action that the audience could immediately implement to improve their finances.

I worked primarily with Joe when he was given the challenge of helping to define the Account Executive group for the Wealthbuilder program. This was uncharted territory for Joe and he embraced the challenge with tenacity and relentless drive day in and day out. Having worked with Joe for almost two years, I would highly recommend him for any position given his intelligence and persistence, especially in the face of adversity."
