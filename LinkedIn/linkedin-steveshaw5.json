Multi Million dollar buyers to Military buyers, they all have different Financial needs.  Processing home searches for buyers and finding them homes is a small part to the process. I set up Home inspections, pest inspections, escrow, etc. for buyers. We have even helped enroll kids into schools for clients. It goes on and on and I am sure you personally have been down this road yourself. Sometimes this is a very stressful time for the buyers since this is their largest financial purchase but we try to make the transition seamless without any surprises.
