        "summary": "    I am Executive Chairman and Chair of the Investment Committee at Accelerated Digital Ventures (http://accelerated.ventures). Previously I was founder and a partner at Archimedes Labs (http://archimedeslabs.com) in Palo Alto, California.I served as chairman of the Board at Minds and Machines Inc (London AIM - MMX), and was an Advisory Board member at MedCo and also an Advisory Board member at Verisign.I love working with founders, teams, designers and engineers to create products, tell stories, and turn them into reality. Archimedes has over 20 companies that I mentor and guide.I have founded or co-founded many companies myself since the early 1980s. Some were successfully sold, others IPO'd.Two of my companies were Unicorns - valued by others at more than $1 billion (EasyNet and RealNames). They span enterprise software with hundreds of customers (cScape/Clerkswell) ISPs and consumer web with millions (EasyNet/RealNames), Mobile (chat.center).I have always focused on the point at which change is happening. In the 1980's networking and databases (cScape). In the 1994-1998 period, Internet Access (EasyNet and Cyberia). From 1998-2010 - Web Services and Content (RealNames and TechCrunch) and since 2010 Mobile Consumer Applications (chat.center and Archimedes Labs). I am proud of my work - successes and learning failures alike. I learned a great deal from each. I have had to deal with Investors, boards, partners, customers; advertisers and their agencies, bankers; Governments; Organizations and Institutions. I have served on many boards. I have managed small teams of 2 or 3 and larger teams of over 300. Above all else, I have been privileged to work with great people whilst doing what I love - making change a positive experience.Specialties:--Board leadership--Investing;--Corporate Strategy; --Product Strategy; --Positioning and Go To Market planning;--Policy Issues; --Standards Efforts; --Evangelizing; --Communicating\n  \n  \n",
