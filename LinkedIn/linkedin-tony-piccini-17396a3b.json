I was responsible for hiring and managing our financial support team and billing staff, I worked on month-end consolidated financial statements to present to our owners and I prepared bi-monthly payroll for processing.  My responsibilities also included direct client work with many AZ and CA State Agencies, contract review and negotiation, and management of our client budgets.  I also selected and implemented the Agency Software used to run Program Management, Internal Job Jackets, Time Entry and billing for our Media, Creative, Public Relations and Account Service Departments.  I was the primary contact for training on all aspects of this software including On-Boarding of new employees and any updates, new procedures and report writing aspects.  I also managed, updated and backed up the SQL Server on a daily basis for the IT Department.Using my creative skills, I was involved in New Business Presentations, Jingle Writing for clients and internal company planning for staff parties and meetings.  I started our Company Band SUKTAKULAR and coordinated playing at company parties and other events.  SUKTACULAR even recorded a song for a Pharmaceutical Company that we represented.  It was a joy to be able to use my creativity in this setting while working in the financial department of an Advertising Agency.  I was honored when our owner would introduce me as Tony, the singing accountant and when our Creative Director would call me to write a song for a new business pitch.  It made the work even more fun and interesting while allowing me to demonstrate my vast and diverse skills."

Although this requires very hard work, persistence and the ability to multi-task, these industries are exciting to work in and they create work cultures that are unlike other industries  I have encountered.  Having an outgoing personality and having an accounting background, my career objectives were always to find an industry that allowed me to use my personality and creative side along with my expertise in management, customer service and of course, finance.  I can say that I have been extremely fortunate to have worked in careers that have given back to me instead of me giving all to a job.\n  \n  \n",
