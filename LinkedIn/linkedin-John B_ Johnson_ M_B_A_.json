It is focused on increasing face-to-face connections by utilizing existing collaborative venues as a platform to enhance communities. Feel Free has seamlessly combined three business platforms that will allow local businesses to promote themselves to their community on a highly personal level. I orchestrated a team of professionals to design, develop and implement a new idea into a functioning technological platform that combines social media and marketing, allowing businesses to more efficiently identify, market, and interact with their customers. ►►How it works and who it's for◄◄Feel Free makes communities stronger by making sure everyone talks to one another. We have created a mobile application that gives you the capability to see who else is in the coffee shop or other Feel Free space you're at so that you can then connect, communicate, and meet them should you desire to do so.This app shows you their names, what they do for a living, where they are from and the good things others have said about them. This helps you learn things about those around you so you can decide whether or not they are someone you want to meet. The app also allows the owners of the businesses to be able to communicate with you by letting you know of new events that are coming up, new products that just came out and even giving special discounts on products or services. This app is for anyone that wants to meet more people in their community. People that will use this are people that work for themselves or are able to work remotely. Business owners that will use this app own a coffee shop or co-working space that allows their customers to linger for long periods of time and have a desire to communicate more effectively with their patrons.

        "summary": "    “If you're not living on the edge you're taking up too much space.”― Stephen HuntSince I can remember, this philosophy has fueled me to pursue lofty goals and ambitions; ambitions that taught me that failure is a good thing. As a kid, I enjoyed creating environments and experiences for those around me. This passion led to earn a Masters in Architecture, and since I wanted to live on the edge, I earned my MBA as well. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬While studying architecture, I realized that my designs consistently centered around creating spaces that enhances the way people engaged with one another. Eventually this led to my obsession with community and collaboration. Over the past 3 years, I have fearlessly pursued many collaborations ranging from architectural design and real estate development all the way to social entrepreneurship and founding a tech startup.▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬Above all, I’m a passionate social entrepreneur whose sole purpose in life is to empower others, enhance communities and create experiences that inspire growth. “Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently…” ― Rob SiltanenSpecialties: ►Business Strategy & Consulting►Social Entrepreneurship►Branding & Culture►Ideation►Project Coordination\n  \n  \n",
