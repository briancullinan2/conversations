Together we worked on several programs.  He broke down walls when necessary, understood that we jointly had a mission to improve various aspects of our own internal operations.  We were highly successful.  I thoroughly enjoyed working with him, and would certainly do so again if the opportunity presented itself."

I thoroughly enjoyed this process, and would work with him in a heartbeat.  I found him to be insightful, thoughtful, highly cooperative, and highly \"teamwork oriented\".
