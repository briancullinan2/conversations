Outsiders and meandering hotel guests during a reception, reunion, or sumptuous event just don’t mix well. At one of our private Scottsdale Venues you won’t have another tipsy guest wander over and will never have to compete for a spot at your own private bar. Venues of North Scottsdale offer extreme privacy with no foot traffic!Guidelines are unavoidable; however, how many rules is what matters. We’ve found hotels and resorts to often hand clients an complete book of rules and limitations before planning of the corporate event has even begun. When it comes to private venues, you’re do business with people, not brochures or rule books. So, while safeguarding our venues is of our topmost importance, we’ll not ever freak you out with files of limitations and fine print."

        "summary": "    Our venues host some of the best...Corporate events, brand launches, private parties, experiential events, parties, reunions, shindigs…you name it we are the coolest hippest venues in North Scottsdale!  14 spaces from 3500 feet to 35,000 one hangar is like you just walked into Las Vegas.Located in Scottsdale we are the Valley’s newest event venue’s. It is the ideal destination for creating the most memorable corporate or social events in Scottsdale. Industrial venues give you plenty of opportunity to make a space your own. This previous year we’ve observed a lot of great corporate event trends, but one of our favorites, by far, is the increase in popularity of hangar venues. For many years, people have been holding secret parties in cool warehouse spaces and abandoned buildings. But this year we’ve seen the concept move mainstream, hangars. Hangar spaces are being used for all types of events, from corporate dinner parties to music performances; and most notably incentive events.A fresh, more leading-edge form of social entertainment has been growing in status over the last few years, with the rise of immersive experiences. They have become the “must have” thing for social entertaining, and we wholly expect their attractiveness to continue to grow.  The test will be for all of us in the events industry vendor or planner will to be to make our events as electrifying, mystifying and immersive as imaginable. Truly immersive experiences are all about producing wonder, anticipation and a real “wow” effect. In this highly connected world, the amount of ambiguity and amazement is increasingly scarce, and what guests at immersive experiences enjoy is being plunged into a absolutely outlandish state where they might end up in the middle of a flash mob or a panic room with no way out but to find the way. \n  \n  \n",
