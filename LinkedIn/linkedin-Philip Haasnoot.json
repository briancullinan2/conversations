                "David is an outstanding professional with a keen eye for brand marketing and awareness. His detail oriented nature and outstanding grasp on the \"big picture\" shine through with any of his productions. He can leap tall buildings in a single bound, faster than a speeding bullet.... I might be confusing him with superman, I'm not sure..... either way he is an outstanding team player with a fantastic work ethic."
