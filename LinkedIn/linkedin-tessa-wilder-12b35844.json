Throughout our conversations and later in-person meetings, I was quite intrigued by her ability to light up a room with her friendly personality that could make anyone's day- a trait often unheard of these days. Tessa paid close attention to what I was looking for in a position, and she fortified its essence by asking the right questions and matching me with the right recruiters to ultimately land me at my current position. Tessa is the kind of professional I would want on my team- I highly recommend her and wish her the best at Modis."

I have had the pleasure of being successful in both small and large software companies but I get the most satisfaction when I am building teams/companies from the ground up! I like to think that I am very good at surviving off of pure caffeine, wearing the worst shoes in the rain and putting bacon on things that should not have bacon...wait, what should not have bacon? Some of my greatest personal accomplishments include successfully using a Windows phone, raising a puppy, holding the title of most pudding cups consumed at my high school, killing a succulent, and growing up in one of the best states (Idaho)!
