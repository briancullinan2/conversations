        "summary": "    I am passionate about all things HR and have integrated my nerdy tech side into that.  My full time gig is running a boutique IT services firm.  Recruiting is the heavy lifting in this endeavor.  Beyond that I like to dabble in various tech adventures, whether that is picking up web development to take a hands on role in creating the company's website or studying gamification to gain knowledge in how to deliver mobile wellness solutions.  Exposure as an employee and vendor to companies of various sizes has given me a rounded background in business and some great HR knowledge:  Employee Relations, Compensation Planning, Performance Management, Recruiting, Process Improvement, and Legal Compliance to name a few.  I like to use that knowledge to make work and work-life better.\n  \n  \n",
