Check out some examples of my work at imbrittany.com and maddartcreative.com/Maddart-Creative-Sample-Portfolio.pdfI'm the founder and creator of things at Maddart Creative, a boutique design studio committed to engaging clients and creating meaningful experiences through beautiful, innovative work. With over 8 years in the industry and through Maddart Creative, I'm able to bring agency experience and knowledge to the one-on-one relationships I build with my clients. I collaborate with my clients and other agencies to help solve communication problems and bring ideas to life with fresh and impactful visual design in branding and identity, graphic, app, and web.  Nicknamed \"hawkeye\" by my peers, I have a heightened sense of detail and work hard to execute great design. I'm constantly trying new ideas, learning, and pushing boundaries so that I can stay on top of the latest trends and grow beyond. I happily welcome new challenges and look forward to projects that call for innovation.As a self-proclaimed nerd, I've found a way to combine both my loves of design and nerd culture by volunteering as Art Coordinator with Phoenix Comicon. I have a slight addiction to collecting Funko Pops, figures, and other memorabilia from various fandoms. When I’m not in front of the computer or buying things on Amazon, I’m likely found enjoying time with those closest to me, riding my bike, indulging in coffee, or playing with my dogs, Maddox the pug and Arthur the rescue.Let's connect and create something awesome!\n  \n  \n",
