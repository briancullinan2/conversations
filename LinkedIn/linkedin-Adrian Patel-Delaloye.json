In my Managerial Decision Making (MGT 475) senior seminar course in Spring 2013, Adrian produced good results on projects and exams, but he truly distinguished himself by consistently demonstrating the kinds of behavioral qualities that are crucial for reliably contributing to a growing organization's productivity and collegiality.  Throughout the semester, he always seemed interested and engaged in class discussions and made contributions of insights that helped the entire class to learn and be more productive.  His points usually reflected uncommonly good critical thinking, with contrarian or provocative aspects expressed with professionalism -- an essential quality for breaking through mere group-think.  Basically, he showed the kind of personable enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity that made my job easier and raised the results for everyone.  That semester and ever since, Adrian seems remarkably willing to confront the uncertainties of real-world business issues, recognizing that “answers” in business are not found on certain pages in textbooks rather must be tackled through hard work, applied thought, and creative collaboration, and I’ve seen him extend these qualities markedly in his first few years working in industry.  It’s been a pleasure to remain in contact with Adrian, not least because I admire the type of roles he has taken on and the types of contributions he has made, as these exemplify entrepreneurial qualities I see as being most valuable to highly aspirational companies.  If I could have a “dream team” class comprised of my best students of recent years, Adrian would certainly be on it.  So with respect to bold, entrepreneurial thinking with the personal and leadership skills to turn ideas into action, Adrian has my highest recommendation."

        "summary": "    Adrian Patel-Delaloye is a driven entrepreneur with an obsession for health, art and adventure. During his childhood, he lived in six countries while traveling with his entrepreneurial, hippy parents. This constant change early on broadened his perspective on both education and business.Adrian attended Northern Arizona University to study Biomedical Science and Business Administration. During his time at NAU, he was inspired to start a number of projects including CardaMints and Parallel.Parallel grew quickly, so Adrian decided to build a team to turn the idea into a reality. The mission was to create an app to revolutionize the way personal connections were curated on mobile mediums, a passion that ties directly into his love of travel and meeting new people. Despite bootstrapping early on, finances later forced the team to pursue other career possibilities.At the time Parallel came to a close, Adrian was approached by the Giftcard Zen team. He soon realized the potential behind the business model and joined the team as an Account Manager. He quickly moved up in the company to Head of Sales and again to Vice President of Growth. Giftcard Zen was acquired by publicly-traded, Retail Me Not INC., for $32M.\n  \n  \n",
