                "Kathey is a born leader . I have known her for over 20 years as both a State Farm Insurance colleague and independent consultant for my sales team at AAA Arizona Inc. She completed an overview of the Arizona insurance marketplace to help us assess our strategic growth opportunity . The work had great depth and breadth but was easy to deciminate and articulate to non insurance professionals. I would recommend Kathey and her team for leadership development, strategic planning , business consulting and operational excellence work .Brad Oltmans , VP sales and service AAA Arizona Inc"

                "Many of Kathey’s recommendations will come from her peers and executive level business associates spanning her decades of association with a Fortune 50 company.  They will endorse her highly for her intellect, leadership, analytical superiority, and her ability to view and assess business solutions from 36K feet.   Her business acumen is as good as it gets.  My endorsement will lend to Kathey’s management style from someone who did not work as her peer or superior, but rather from an executive support role.  Enterprise Structure Study was launched in January 2000, and was my first opportunity to work directly with Kathey, providing support for the core team. I was immediately impressed with her down to earth and inclusive nature.  The study was a self-contained, independent and highly confidential company overview, involving virtual teams, excessive travel, and demanding effective communication and team accessibility from across the country with the teams.  Kathey aced the assignment.I laud Kathey’s humanity, her down to earth accessibility; intuition; intelligence; her willingness to do whatever task needed to perpetuate the good of the whole.   Kathey is one of those rare managers that will literally be in the trenches getting it done, alongside every level of hire, with an intense loyalty to her team and employees.  She possesses the rare ability to infuse humor and her depth of life experiences to motivate, inspire and teach.  Kathey possesses a level of generosity that is unmatched, as evidenced by her volunteerism to various charity boards and causes.  Mary Wakeford"
