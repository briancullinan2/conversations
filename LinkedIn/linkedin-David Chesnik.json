Essentially a consortium of individual communities, each with its own character, some neighborhoods of this sprawling metropolitan area retain a small town feel while others have landed feet first in the future. There is true diversity in and near the heart of Phoenix.  BuyersHave you ever fallen in love with a home listed online only to find out it was under contract? I have, and that is why I made a vow that when I became a Realtor my web site would only show active listings from the MLS. Stop wasting your time and getting your hopes up for a home that is already spoken for. I will get you the home you want and negotiate the best price possible and closing terms that meet your needs. I also have in-house lenders to help you get your property financed at a competitive rate. If there is grant money available to eligible buyers I will find it for you.SellersWhen you sold your house in the past did you feel like you heard more from your Realtor before you signed the contract to list your house then after? That won’t happen here. I communicate throughout the process of selling your home and make sure it is sold for the optimum price in the quickest fashion possible. I am an extremely effective marketer and will feature your home across numerous avenues ."

While raising donations, I am able to help home buyers find the homes of their dreams and sellers move on to the next stage of their lives. If you are going to buy or sell a home, or know someone who is, please consider helping me donate even more to this great organization in my role as a Realtor. \n  \n  \n",
