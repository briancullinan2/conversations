He related every topic of the SAFe Training with the real-world client experience and helped us connect our current environment. I was amazed at how he spent time with each one of us to understand our current world and our expectations out of the course and adjusted his training. 2 days of very productive and time well spent.

Since Billy has huge hands-on experience implementing SAFe and coaching teams, he was able to go beyond the training material and share many valuable tips and success stories. The sessions were very interactive, included video material and team activities - which constantly kept everyone engaged. As an instructor, I must mention, he does a phenomenal job at conveying his ideas, handling questions, driving discussions, creating an interactive environment, staying poised, making learning fun and keeping a track of time. If there is a SAFe training you are planning for your leaders/teams, I would very strongly recommend having Billy train, coach and mentor."
