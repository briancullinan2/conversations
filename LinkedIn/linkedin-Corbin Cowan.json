        "summary": "    My name is Corbin Cowan and I am the Chief Executive Officer at Fast Plastic Parts, a contract manufacturer of plastic parts and tooling for an array of applications including medical, consumer, and industrial.Following my graduation from the University of Colorado Boulder, I began my career at C&J Exploration, an oil and gas exploration and production company. After spending several years learning the ins and outs of the business, I purchased C&J Exploration in 2006 and led the organization as Chief Executive Officer until 2008. Continuing upon my entrepreneurial mindset, I founded Strategic Equity Partners in 2007 to deliver financial solutions to both accredited and non-accredited investors within the plastic industry. Serving as its President, I continue to direct the company and generate double-digit returns for individual investors. Melding my passion for finance with my business expertise, I co-founded CXO Collective in 2012. Representing a new model for next-generation private equity firms that buy, build, and sell companies, CXO Collective educates over 200 C-Level executives, entrepreneurs, and investors on how to create a balanced, successful, and fulfilling professional and personal life.In 2015, I created and launched Fast Plastic Parts where I motivate, direct, and lead the organization, as well as lay its foundation for expansion. Specializing in plastic molding, affordable tooling, and fast turnaround, Fast Plastic Parts is poised to continue its growth both organically and through acquisition to provide an even better service for customers. \n  \n  \n",
