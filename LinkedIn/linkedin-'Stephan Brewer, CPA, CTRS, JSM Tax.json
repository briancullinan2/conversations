Brewer with Legacy Tax Resolutions Services.   He tells people that his firm does three things very well, Tax Preparation/Planning, Tax Problem Solving and Profit Maximization. It’s the profit maximization that is the key to his marketing strategy; he helps people grow their business so that they need his tax planning and high level tax preparation. It’s no wonder why he has 13 offices and tons of recommendations.In the past 6 weeks, Stephan and I have passed 40 referrals back and forth.  If your CPA is not giving you referrals, you may want to rethink that relationship."
