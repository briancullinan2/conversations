        "summary": "    As an executive with almost twenty years of experience, I truly believe that marketing is the foundation of every organization.  Whether you are running an organization in a service industry, selling a product or helping save the world, how you market your organization will ultimately have a direct impact on how successful the organization is. Every point of interaction a customer has with any person, media, communication, product or service emanating from any organization, impacts the market perception of the organization as a whole. Perception is reality and as an executive who has had the privilege of leading organizations in the for-profit and non-forprofit worlds, it is my passion and my ultimate mission to ensure that perception and reality are one and the same! As a leader, I believe in working with a team to ensure we all share the company's  vision so together we can ensure each goal is realized. This can only be achieved through inspiration, motivation and working together towards a shared vision. By inspiring my team to share the passion, to understand the big picture and by incentivizing them to take responsibility and ensure they fully understand the strategy, I believe they can become leaders of their own! There is no greater investment than in our human capital. The people we work with are the ones who make things happen and the people we work for are the ones who motivate us to do so! My philosophy is always to work hard- play hard, to constantly find solutions, not problems, and to remember that success should be shared to make the world a better place!\n  \n  \n",
