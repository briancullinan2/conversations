Construction can create a dangerous environment, which is why we make safety our number one priority.No J.B. Steel employee will ever arrive at a job site without completing an extensive safety orientation based on the Operation Safe Site training program for OSHA Subpart R, Steel Erection. At least once per year, every employee receives a full day refresher training course that is focused on safety and quality.We require 100% tie off when working at an exposed edge with a fall potential of six feet or greater. In addition, all of our iron workers are required to carry a sliding beam clamp to facilitate tie off. On all major projects, we work with our general contractor partners to develop and implement both a Project Specific Erection Plan and a Project Specific Safety Plan."

Many states have requirements or voluntary guidelines for workplace injury and illness prevention programs. Also, numerous employers in the United States already manage safety using Injury and Illness Prevention Programs and we believe that all employers can and should do the same. Most successful injury and illness prevention programs are based on a common set of key elements. These include: management leadership, worker participation, hazard identification, hazard prevention and control, education and training, and program evaluation and improvement."

        "summary": "    http://www.thebluebook.com/iProview/955961At  J.B. Steel, we believe that all accidents are preventable with the proper systems, tools, education, and awareness. Construction can create a dangerous environment, which is why we make safety the priority everyday. No J.B. Steel employee will ever arrive at a job site without completing an extensive safety orientation based on the Operation Safe Site training program for OSHA Subpart R, Steel Erection. At least once per year, every employee receives a full day refresher training course that is focused on safety and quality.We require 100% tie off when working at an exposed edge with a fall potential of six feet or greater. In addition, all of our iron workers are required to carry a sliding beam clamp to facilitate tie off. On all major projects, we work with our general contractor partners to develop and implement both a Project Specific Erection Plan and a Project Specific Safety Plan.\n  \n  \n",
