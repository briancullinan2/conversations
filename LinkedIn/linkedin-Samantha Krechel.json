I see Kelly as one of the best people I have around me and I believe he has helped my development professionally and personally.He was able to see my talent and abilities and let me shine as an individual and let me have a voice. He was honest with me and would challenge me and make me think. He was able to see my blind spots and determine a plan for improvement. I found great value in his counsel - he is much wiser and more experienced.Kelly was always a team player and would never keep things for himself but make sure he was giving credit where credit was due. Part of being a mentor is making sure you feel comfortable opening up and discussing sensitive issues. Kelly most certainly was and is that still to this day - my success as an individual depends on it.Now as I have moved up in my career, I always take note of all the valuable things that I obtained from Kelly and still to this day I value his good opinions.
