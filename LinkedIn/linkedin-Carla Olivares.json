She came right to my house the day I called her, which was a huge plus. Caras understood exactly what my wife was going for, and made her look beautiful :-) I'd highly recommend Beauticians On The Go! Thanks again Carla for making my wife’s day very special. She received tons of compliments all night about her beautiful hair and make up. You are amazing:)"

I was not sure where or how this service would be of use to me at the time, but as it happen to turn out I was hired for a photo shoot about a month after meeting Carla.I only had a few days to prepare and get things in order, I called my regular stylist who was not available (do to a death in the family) and her shop was closed for a week.Remembering Carla's services, I decided to take a chance and see what she could do, there are not many places I let cut my hair because it goes in so many directions...lol, you have to kinda learn the grade as they say.I contacted Carla and set up an appointment with no problem. The next day Carla arrived, I let her know how it needs to be cut from showing some older photos and she did not blink an eye, showed no nervousness and wrapped the apron on and went to work.30 Minutes later Carla was done and from haircut, to facial trim (mustache) I was very pleased. Next day at the shoot, I got several compliments on how detailed my cut was, I will definitely be using Carla's services again.Beauticians On The Go, is now locked in my phone:-)"
