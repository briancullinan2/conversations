Within the past month Tennessee law enforcement has set about implementing their software, to help victims.Both co-founder's  Cryptic  are  victims of cyberstalking. Kris Degioia, herself is a victim of one of the biggest federal cyberstalking case in U.S. History. Mykel Hawke's case is still awaiting trial. Our goal of Cryptic was to create software that would be capable to help law enforcement, also putting online predators behind bars, along with offering emotional support, for victims and their families.  ​ ​Cryptic  provides not only software but also, helping victims with both practical assistance and advice as well as the emotional support they need to cope and recover from PTSD. All the members working at the company have been the victims of the same crime and they carry firsthand experience.
