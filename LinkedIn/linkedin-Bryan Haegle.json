                "This is why a lot of people disrespect recruiters because this happens DAILY, meaningless fluff, and almost all the e-mails you see below, plus the other 20 in the trash are all cut and paste for a job.  I know you think you mean well, but as any IT professional gets bombarded like this, do you really expect us to have any positive response or outlook when working with recruiters?",
