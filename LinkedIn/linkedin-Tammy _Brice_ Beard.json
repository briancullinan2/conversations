She excels at any project she takes on whether it is by choice or circumstance. She is professional yet personable and can both give and take direction well with great attention to detail. Tammy is the very definition of a multi-tasker and anyone with trouble in this area would be wise to observe her in action. Her advanced skills and innate wisdom are only superseded by her warm smile, likability, and overall charm. She knows how to put a good spin on a bad situation to seamlessly conquer the tasks at hand.
