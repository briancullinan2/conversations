In addition to that formal education, he has also extended his post-graduate education in music composition, audio engineering, film production, and performance.  He has always balanced technical endeavors with equal and opposite artistic forces.He has been studying and performing long-form improvisation since 2003 and dug deeply into the Meisner Method of acting in 2006.  He now partners with several other Meisner trained actor/directors in a comprehensive training program and coaches/teaches weekly in Phoenix, AZ.Tommy is driven by his passion for music, film, and performance and balances this artistic side with a career in audio engineering & mixing for both on-location and in-studio sound recording scenarios.  He has been regularly working as an audio engineer in Phoenix since 2008 and has credits for location audio, post-production studio mixing/mastering, original music composition and live performance mixing.In 2012, he founded Polymathus, LLC, which would finally be \"home\" for these highly diversified yet tightly correlated pursuits.\n  \n  \n",
