Get out of the way of your people and let them do their job. Set the goals, provide guidance, and stay out of the way. It's a challenge for many leaders who think they have to be closely involved or things will go wrong. Get out of the way and let your people surprise you with what they can do. If you've hired right, you will be blown away by their work.",
