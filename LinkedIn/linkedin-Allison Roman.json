I  had the pleasure of working with Jerilyn as both a Recruiter and as a Business Development Manager.  She consistently did an outstanding job of understanding her client's environment and staffing needs as well as relaying information to her recruiting team so as to find the best possible candidates.  The best part of working with Jerilyn was her bubbly personality, she has a knack for keeping everyone on her team smiling and laughing!"
