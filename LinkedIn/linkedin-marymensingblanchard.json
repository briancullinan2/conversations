Regarding Mary Blanchard  - the title Sales Representative may be a misnomer:  She actually is an Ambassador for Carnegie. Mary has never once said no to me, yet she has always provided alternatives for every obstacle our projects have presented. I enjoy working with her and that's why I repeatedly make her my initial call whenever a project is undertaken. She has the best business manner and unending knowledge of her products and manufacturing techniques. I recommend her wholeheartedly as an effective and creative team member for business."
