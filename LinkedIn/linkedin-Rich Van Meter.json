Rich was the first person I ever managed that taught me this lesson.  Rich did not come from staffing but managed a critical part our staffing function on the Sales and Support side.  He came from the Sales and Support organization to help rebuild the relationship between staffing and the business and improve our hiring capabilities during a time of hyper-growth.  Rich has exceptional communication, management and leadership skills.  His insights in to the staffing function were very refreshing.
