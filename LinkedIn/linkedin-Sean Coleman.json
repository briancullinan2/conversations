We have worked together on at least six projects and I have been delighted with the results every time. I hesitated writing this recommendation as I consider him my \"secret weapon\" and don't want the word to get out.  But I now consider him a friend and promoting him is the least I can do.  You will be very well served hiring Sean for web consultation, design or development."
