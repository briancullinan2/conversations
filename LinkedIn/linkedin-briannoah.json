The idea of putting years of work into a product that doesn't even work properly, that is riddled with technical debt, disparate technologies, and overly complex systems, drives me absolutely crazy; yet this is the norm. The solution is actually pretty simple. Hiring the right person at the start of the business. The choice of a technical founder can make all the difference in the world. My background as a photographer, musician, mechanic, small business owner, and software architect, along with my experience in leadership starting from my early teens, gives me a very distinct perspective when it comes to what I bring to the table. I envision software systems in a unique way. I'm open to new technologies, but generally only when they have been proven as viable in the real world. I hold a belief in lean and agile methodologies, which has consistently lead me to the creation of working(sellable) software within a month of starting development. \n  \n  \n",
