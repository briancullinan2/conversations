She was so passionate about the company and energized about her role in helping the company grow that I couldn't help but be impressed.  One thing that was extremely unusual in my experience in being recruited is how focused Sidney was on me.  I felt in every interaction - and they were frequent - that I was her only candidate, not just for the particular role but her only candidate overall.  She was so good at making me feel that I would be an important addition to Early Warning that I couldn't help but feel special.  After I joined the company, I found out that Sidney was recruiting dozens of people at the same time which made me wonder how she was able to accomplish this.

She was so passionate about the company and energized about her role in helping the company grow that I couldn't help but be impressed.  One thing that was extremely unusual in my experience in being recruited is how focused Sidney was on me.  I felt in every interaction - and they were frequent - that I was her only candidate, not just for the particular role but her only candidate overall.  She was so good at making me feel that I would be an important addition to Early Warning that I couldn't help but feel special.  After I joined the company, I found out that Sidney was recruiting dozens of people at the same time which made me wonder how she was able to accomplish this.  Since then, I've spoken with others that were recruited by Sidney and she made them all feel that way.  Sidney has integrity, loyalty, passion and is highly charged up about making her company successful through the right hires."
