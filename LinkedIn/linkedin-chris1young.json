He put up with (and sometimes went along with) my strong opinions on Ruby best practices, yet stood his ground when he knew I was attempting something that wasn't in line with the Rails way or the Integrum way.  And he did it all in very amicable fashion.He's also dedicated to constant improvement of his own techniques and the health of the software development ecosystem.  In his spare time, he blogs about his experiences with customers and fellow developers, and how to get the two to see eye to eye and create successful products.
