Our lives are hectic; most people don't have five hours to play golf. The number of active golfers in the US has declined from 30MM in 2002 to 21MM today. Golf courses sell only 51% of their tee times - 430MM tee times parished last year for no revenue. The \"product-market fit\" for golf has deteriorated over time, and we bring the innovation to fix it.Unlike the traditional 18-hole round that is sold today, we enable golfers to buy golf in time increments that fit their life. The consumer picks any 30 minute increment that works for their schedule. We also offer ‘on-ramp’ options like junior rates or playing 150-yards into the green for people learning the game.http://getoutgolf.com"

        "summary": "    Notable experiences: - Four times launching first-to-market technology solutions (3x B2B, 1xB2C) - Ran global business and lead international team - Experience spans consulting, startup, and corporate environments (General Electric Company) - P&L management - Product management - Sales leader (direct team and channel partners)Todd has spent the majority of his career driving technology innovations to help businesses grow.After beginning his career in management consulting, Todd found his passion in technology and innovation when he joined a Chicago-based startup that leveraged the internet to help industrial companies transact more efficiently. Before returning to school to earn an MBA in entrepreneurship and strategy from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, Todd assisted the General Electric Company with merger & acquisition initiatives.  Upon completing his MBA, Todd joined a newly acquired GE business to launch a first-to-market software solution in the industrial non-destructive testing industry. Two years later another business was added to the portfolio, and Todd was selected to run it. There he led the introduction of another industry innovation: the first software applications that run directly on inspection devices.  Todd's next role moved him away from conceptualizing and launching new products to selling them as he led the sales team for the North American business.Todd's current role with Cruise Automation marks his fifth time launching new-to-market innovations, and it promises to be, by far, the most impactful to people's lives by making transportation safer, more accessible, and more convenient. \n  \n  \n",
