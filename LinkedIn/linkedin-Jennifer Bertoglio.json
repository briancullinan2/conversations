        "summary": "    I am a successful entrepreneur, business executive, attorney and avid adventure traveler.  When people ask me: \"Where do you live?\", I describe myself as World Citizen and a bit of a digital nomad.  Between meeting diverse people across the United States and the globe, you can find me in San Francisco, CA; Scottsdale, AZ; Chicago, IL; and most recently, Charlotte & Raleigh, NC.  In 2005, after a decade of serving in a large corporate law department and a mid-sized law firm, I left my “responsible” legal career to experiment with ways to better streamline e-Discovery services delivery and improve the lives of the temporary legal workforce. With a $30,000 personal investment and a folding table in a spare bedroom, I founded and built the first legal process outsourcing firm that became the predominant standard used by several of the country’s largest companies. The LawyerLink facility, located on 2 floors in Chicago's Sears Tower, was filled with hundreds of happy attorneys (yes, really!) working behind the scenes on significant litigations for several of the Fortune 100 companies. The LawyerLink team also created an unprecedented professional workplace culture that is oftentimes lacking in contract attorney work. Five years later, in 2010, I successfully sold my company, LawyerLink, to Axiom Law, the largest legal marketplace disrupter reshaping legal services delivery.Today, I am working to repeat history as I strive to rethink staffing and integrate technology to improve client and workforce experiences and outcomes.  In that effort, effective January 1, 2017, I acquired 2 companies based in Charlotte: a professional staffing company and a healthcare staffing company.  We will operate as Premier Resources Group, Inc. and continue to serve North Carolina and beyond.  I am grateful for the opportunity to create more jobs and improve lives for this new team.\n  \n  \n",
