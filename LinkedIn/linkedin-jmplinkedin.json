                "Getting ADMS Live - 2016 was a challenging year and go-live was real for January 25, so we were told that we had 1000+ manhours of Data Corrections to make before cutover and time was running short with four weeks left before go-live.   All of us, especially Don, recognized that we had to get those changes into production.  Don put together a team of folks across the 24 hour operational shifts along with coordinated my team on the application side to stand up the first ADMS Clients in production in mid-December.  We were still in UAT but we in reality we were live and the operational team was using ADMS.  By January 20, all the data have been moved.  Don worked normal hours supporting the testing and the odd hours supporting the operational teams.   Tenacious is the word that comes to my mind and in the business with millions of customers and multiple data points per customer - that is the only way to keep the lights on without people getting hurt - troublemen and the utility customers were always in the front of Don's concerns.   Our ADMS upgrade did not take a system outage to transition to.  Our customers went from one system to the other during shift change without the customer call center going down.  The team just logged in to the new systems and went to work that day.  We were testing our back up site three days into the cutover.  One month later we upgraded the customer and proved again that it was not a fluke and had no outage to the end users.  The data migration happened while operations maintained use of their application in a seamless transition.  Don believed in me and my team when I told him that I was using distribution processes in my application integration design and we could do our upgrades in without customer impacts.  It was his trust in my approach and support that made that dream a reality - thank you Don.  Another fun discussion - Legacy DOMS - I cannot go into all the war stories about keeping our legacy OMS up and running.  When I had an operational challenge, I called Don and my team to meetings to get the system back up and running.  We had some special days where our network switches failed, database crashed due to GIS bad data, and just overall crazy memory leaks.   Don was my operational partner that explained that this IT guy was not nuts and would get the system back up..  Again  - thank you Don.  It was fun - well weird fun.-- John Peters, ADMS OMS Integration Leader and Distribution Operations IT Supervisor."
