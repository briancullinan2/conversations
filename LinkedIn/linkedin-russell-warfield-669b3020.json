        "summary": "    My work ethos is the belief that once a task has been assigned to me, that I will do what it takes regardless of time to get the job done. I believe that professionalism and punctuality is a must. I enjoy situations that require dynamic thinking to achieve a fluid and cohesive result. I believe that people can do great things when they focus on synergistic enthusiasm and work together. I believe that everyone has the ability to make themselves better constantly by seeking professional and personal development. I pride myself on being relied upon over and over again to perform tasks that are not always in my job and skill set. I constantly try to take a management mindset to improve the work and personal environment around me. I think that companies who strive towards innovation versus renovation have the knowledge and toolkit to remain and be competitive in this dynamic market that we live in. I am apart of the Generation Y, the Web 2.0 and I will always think critically and ask questions to better facilitate the need. My goals are relatively simple:I was never given anything because when I was growing up my family had nothing to give. I had to work for everything and age was irrelevant. I have been working hard since I started Middle School and I enjoy hard work and its benefits.My goal is to work as hard as I can and to constantly better my situation and the people I care about.I want to always take criticism and critiques to better improve my mind, body, and soul.I want to provide for my family to the best of my abilities and create the best possible life I can for us.Specialties: COMPTIA A+, SQL, DBMS, Access, Active Directory, Jgrasp, nmap, IBM software suites, Microsoft Office suites, Falconview, ARCgis\n  \n  \n",
