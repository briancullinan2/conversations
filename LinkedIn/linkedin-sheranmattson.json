Sheran was hired to develop curriculum for adult learners, train facilitators, and design/deliver specialized services to clients. Sheran is the best in her field. Without exception, Sheran delivered the best quality work, on time, and with great sensitivity to the organization and clients' needs. She is the supreme professional. Her integrity, subject matter expertise, and intuitiveness added tremendous value to the organization. I highly recommend Sheran."
