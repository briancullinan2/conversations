        "summary": "    Accomplished Marketing Executive with an entrepreneurial mindset and 10+ years in sales and marketing. Offering integrated project experience in traditional radio advertising, promotions, experiential event marketing, digital solutions and social media strategy and content. Adept in pitching new accounts and building executive-level relationships. I have worked on integrated campaigns for major advertisers and have been recognized with several awards during my career.My clients know me as a highly creative media strategist who can always be trusted to come up with a new and fresh approach. I know that the client’s business comes first, and I never try to impose my ideas on others. Instead, I spend a lot of time understanding the business and the audience before suggesting ideas and solutions. I’m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other marketers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client or business unit leader to understand his or her business objectives. As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow and that’s always the fun part!\n  \n  \n",
