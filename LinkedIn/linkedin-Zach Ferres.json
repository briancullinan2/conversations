        "summary": "    Hey there!I'm an entrepreneur, speaker, runner, and columnist at Entrepreneur Magazine. I'm a leader at heart, an engineer by degree, and a software startup guy by trade. I do what I do to serve, elevate, and connect global startup communities.I'm proud to be the CEO at Coplex, a Startup Accelerator that works with non-coding, subject matter expert founding teams to start software companies. I am also a Founding Partner at Coplex Ventures, our VC-arm.I started my first company when I was 15, far before I had any idea how to spell “entrepreneur.” Before graduating college in 2010, I pitched my company, BounceFire, at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards as one of the “Top 33 Student Entrepreneurs” in the world. Though we didn’t win, a judge from the competition acquired BounceFire in May of 2011.In 2012, many from our original BounceFire team joined Coplex. In 2014, the startups we were co-creating were getting acquired, raising big venture capital rounds, and seeing significant growth. We saw an opportunity in building startups using lean startup methodologies and doubled down. Through 2015, we continued to hone what is now called the “Coplex Lean Process” to take new, “napkin-concept” startups to revenue in as little as 8 weeks. The momentum continued in 2016, and I purchased the company from the founders. Later that year, we had a portfolio venture, Pluto TV, hit a $100M+ valuation.In 2017, we focused on an untapped niche to help non-coder, subject matter expert founders start new software companies. We launched our first $5M accelerator fund to invest in select ventures that come through our program. Since the beginning, we’ve co-created over 250 startups that have collectively raised hundreds of millions in funding, turned into multi-million dollar scale-ups, and even had $100M+ liquidity events.I plan to lead the Coplex team to the global playground and help build successful new ventures and startup communities around the world.\n  \n  \n",
