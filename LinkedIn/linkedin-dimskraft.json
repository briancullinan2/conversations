It was right in front of me, I was able to “see” my thoughts and “feel” how they are transforming into each other. It seemed so easy! Why can’t we just implement the same in the machine? I was drawing rectangles in my school notebook with various phrases inside them and connecting these rectangles with arrows. I didn’t know it was orgraph or state machine, but I was imagining, that some computer could read these phrases then go along arrows and select next phrase and so on. I was enthusiastically reading classical SciFi like “The Invincible” of Stanisław Lem or Asimov series about robots and thinking about how it will be possible in reality?\n  \n  \n",
