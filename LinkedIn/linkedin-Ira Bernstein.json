There are some key traits he displayed that are noteworthy to call out:1) Knowledgeable - Adam knew the platform he supported extremely well.  If he didn't know something, he would always find the answer in a timely manner.2) Exceptional listening skills - Not only did this show in the way we interacted real-time, but in the follow up notes from all of our conversations.3) Trustworthy - When Adam said he would do something, I was 100% confident that it would get done.4) Authentic - It was clear to me from Day 1 that Adam truly cared about my company's success.  I considered him nothing less than my business partner. Hands down, Adam is one of the best Customer Success Managers I have ever worked with and would recommend him both professionally and personally."
