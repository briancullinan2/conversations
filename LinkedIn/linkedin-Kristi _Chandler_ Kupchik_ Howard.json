She is an excellent saleswoman, has a kind and generous demeanor, and is incredibly dedicated in all that she does. While she worked at GoDaddy, her nickname was \"The Shark\" because she absolutely \"killed\" at her job, often leading her team in sales. I often ask her for personal and professional advice, and she always has a wise answer. She is a quick learner and is well-liked by everyone, making her pleasant to work with.
