                "Early in my career, the industry used to \"train\" juniors. We started writing brochures and coupon copy before we got good print briefs. We worked on the retail tv and radio spots before we got a shot at the bigger, better projects. We presented multiple rounds of work to seasoned, and in my fortunate case, excellent, award-winning CDs. And in the production phase, there was even more scrutiny and guidance. Sadly, this doesn't seem to be the case any more. We throw juniors in the deep end, with little time to nurture their ideas. Rather than give raises, we promote people to senior-this and associate-that, when they've got less than 5 real projects under their belt. As an ECD, I'm juggling a lot and often feel I'm failing to give my juniors the mentoring they need, the mentoring I got. It's easy to kill an idea - it's harder and more time consuming to make a good idea great. The business isn't what it used to be, but we need to preserve and protect the culture of creative learning. Be the change you wish to see in the world. And our industry.",
