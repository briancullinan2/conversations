Fees are reasonable, and the goal is to make for company clients much more in sales and profits than they pay us.CEO to Go is also unique in that all three principals, John Heinrich, Michael Bull and Michael Dicarlo, have run companies. The website is www.ceotogo.net.John can be reached at 480-200-5678, or 1-800-716-9626, and the two Mikes phone numbers are on the website."
