I’ve spent two decades studying, teaching, and practicing the science/art of influencing people.  This is not rocket science, but it is brain science.  Often problems that puzzle others have straightforward answers to me based on my particular skills.  I can share them in such areas as . . .\tHow to use my Buyer Motivation Analysis to beat competitors not using it \tHow to create a brand image most appealing to customers or clients\tHow to increase the perceived value of your product or service\tHow to position your product/service above your competitors in the buyer’s mind\tHow to know which features to emphasize and which to forget in advertising\tHow to discover and use emotional motivators to seduce buyers\tHow to pick which logical and emotional satisfactions are key to buyers\tHow to use fear to bring buyers to you\tHow to analyze the four levels of buyer motivation and use them all\tHow to cash in on the fundamental principle of marketing psychology – “people don’t want  what you are selling.”    And much, much more!Psychological marketing influences how buyers see your product/service, putting them in a receptive frame of mind for your sales pitch, and even selling them beforehand!  It give you the “magic inch” of difference separating the winner from second place.  Since buying begins in the mind, doesn’t it make sense to start your marketing there?"
