He had an immediate positive impact, he expertly formed the architecture for how our complex UI could be constructed. Rajat consistently exceeded my expectations and I was very impressed with his superior knowledge of CSS and Javascript.  He always strives for higher performance and his designs are very elegant.I was specifically impressed when he took over a bloated image gallery project that used a few different Javascript libraries and frameworks.  It was cobbled together and had quite a few defects, but within 4 days of Rajat's time he was able to re-write it from scratch, remove all library and framework dependencies and resolving all the defects.His greatest asset is his ability and willingness to learn.  He continually monitors the work and the blogs of the Javascript greats and incorporates those new techniques into his work.He was a critical part of the small team that successfully produced that new database product and I am positive that success will continue to follow him throughout his career."
