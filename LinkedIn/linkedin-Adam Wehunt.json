        "summary": "    Portfolio: AdamWehunt.comBorn and raised in Mesa, Arizona, I am a creative person at heart. After my first discovery of art and computer lab in grade school, I directed my life toward aesthetics and innovation. I graduated from Mesa Community College with an itch to help the world and create. This desire led me to install Solar Panel Systems throughout Arizona. Leading teams of up to 16 people and building something together, has taught me how to work hard and smart. After getting enough of the Arizona sun, I decided it was time to give my body a break, and follow my passion for computers. I've always wanting to know more about how they speak, so Programming was a clear choice for me. Seeing the benefit of learning JavaScript and Angular development, I traveled to Utah to attend Provo’s DevMountain in August of 2016. Throughout the program I fell in love with programming and web development and have been swimming in code ever since. I now reside in Mesa, AZ with my beautiful girlfriend.\n  \n  \n",
