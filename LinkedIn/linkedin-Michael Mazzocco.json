        "summary": "    Michael has been working in hospitality and events for over 25 years. Through innovative event design and smart planning, he sets the stage for people to make life long memories and host successful branded events. Michael feels an event should not be boring and expected, even corporate events, they should all be exciting, creative, and fun, yet functional. He prefers to think out of the box and provide something that no one has ever seen or tasted before. Winning the Best Event Design & Decor Zonie in 2013 was an honor. He has taken those talents and fused them with his extensive food and wine knowledge to bring him where he is today at The Herb Box Catering Company. He feels an event should have an interesting visual and emotional schematic built through design, decor, food, beverage and always interesting entertainment. Michael's events are never boring, but provide the guest with interest from their first impression to their last moment of revelry. Specialties: Food, Wine, Event Decor, Event Coordination, Entertainment, Flow and Function\n  \n  \n",
