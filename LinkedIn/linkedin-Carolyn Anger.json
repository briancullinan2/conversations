Without any editorial or marketing experience, Lisa took me under her wing and taught me everything I know, from writing to social media and beyond. Her time and patience has been indispensible to my career and I would not be where I am professionally today without her. Lisa empowered me to explore many sides of her business and gave me the opportunity to not only write, but also assist in marketing efforts, social media, large event planning and intern hiring and management. Lisa has truly shaped me both professionally and personally and given me the confidence to explore and grow in areas of business I never thought I could. Six years later, I am still a contributing writer for AZ Spa Girls and frequently reach out to Lisa for editorial and career advice. Whether just starting out as an intern or a seasoned writer, marketing, or social media pro, Lisa sees the potential in her employees and goes above and beyond to ensure their personal growth and success."
