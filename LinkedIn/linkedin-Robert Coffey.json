Robert immediately discussed different methods which he had experience, as well as, sharing techniques used by others that he had worked with in the past.  We immediately identified the root cause of the problem and selected methods to increase my group’s operational output by eliminating redundancy and clearly identifying our process.\tAdditionally, I have seen Robert’s dynamic approach and work output as a part of a cross-functional team.  Recently, he was a part of a team seeking to improve efficiency in the team’s output to better meet the customers’ needs.  Robert quickly helped define the issue and discussed methods to reduce the opportunity of operator error through numerous entries.  Furthermore, the group consisted of several personnel that worked offsite at our company’s headquarters.  The group did not encounter issues that can normally plague a group at two different sites mainly because of Robert’s initiative to ensure all personnel could provide inputs from a wide array of professional backgrounds.  Robert utilized the skills and assets that he brought to the table within the group and quickly helped galvanize this team to focus on and resolve the issues they were looking to remedy.  As a result the team minimized entry errors through use of a newly validated system and produced a much more compliant system that increased productivity by 75%!\tI strongly recommend Robert Coffey as a professional who can contribute in any organization on any team.  He is a tremendous teacher, as well as a skilled Systems Analyst expert:  A consummate professional."
