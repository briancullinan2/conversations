                "Amy Webb is one of the rare people that demonstrates excellence in every aspect of her job, going above and beyond to meet deadlines and deliver world-class customer experiences. As a QA Lead, she has an excellent understanding of the agile development lifecycle and a keen eye for defects in both code and process, greatly reducing defects and ERs, which in turn significantly cuts costs in application development. In addition, she manages to test and review code from six different developers by herself every sprint, further proving how hard and proficiently she works. It is with great confidence and without reservation, and with these things in mind, that I can recommend Amy for any senior QA or QA management roles."
