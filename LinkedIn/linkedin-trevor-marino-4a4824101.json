Aerospike founders wanted to make scaling easy for all developers, not just the few who worked at companies with deep enough pockets to build their own.They did what they set out to do. They built the fastest, most reliable database in the world. The first database optimized for flash (patent pending) with a hybrid RAM/flash storage architecture. The first NoSQL database to combine transactions with “hot” analytics (patent for indexed map reduce) and the first in-memory NoSQL database with strong consistency (ACID).Aerospike has run non-stop in production for > 6 years. It is the gold standard for the most demanding applications – real-time bidding platforms (RTB) and data management platforms (DMP) in ad-tech – the foundation for one-to-one digital marketing across the entire Internet. Companies like AppNexus, BlueKai, Kayak, Williams-Sonoma, and DraftKings. In addition, devops engineers are now replacing caching tiers, redis clusters, in-memory databases and first generation NoSQL databases with Aerospike – a database that is as fast as a cache!"
