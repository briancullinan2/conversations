Despite this progress, integrating multi-omics data across multiple patients remains as major challenge because samples from same disease can be very heterogeneous. During my stay at MIT, I'm working on new network optimization algorithm that integrates different \"comics\"  data and can extracts deregulated pathways in individual patients and highlights new targets for therapeutic developments."
