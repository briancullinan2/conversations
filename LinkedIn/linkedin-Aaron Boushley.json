He was moving the team forward, before even completing our on-boarding process.Aside from technical aptitude and skill, Aaron injects a healthy level of pragmatism when solving problems.

In addition to shipping code in week one, Aaron took it upon himself to improve our development process and tooling as well. He was moving the team forward, before even completing our on-boarding process.Aside from technical aptitude and skill, Aaron injects a healthy level of pragmatism when solving problems. He manages to maintain that difficult balance between shipping quickly and building elegant systems. And to top it all off, Aaron is simply a great person to work with. He is both trustworthy and personable. I sincerely hope I have the opportunity to work with him again."
