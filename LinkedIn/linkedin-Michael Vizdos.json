He leads and helps you along the way. He does not give you the answer out right, Mike asks questions to help you gain understanding on your own rather that feeding you the answers.  He has such great perspective and thoughts…most of this can be seen in Mike's wonderful website.  I was interested in being a certified Scrum Trainer at one point in time and Mike allowed me to observe a class that he was teaching. It really helped me to see what I wanted to be doing and to even check to see if being a certified trainer was something that I could do.  I do highly recommend Mike.
