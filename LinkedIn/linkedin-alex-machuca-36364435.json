                "It is not often you get the pleasure of working with someone as much as I did with Bobby. Bobby is one of the best candidates I have worked with in a long time. His feedback was almost always immediate. He is detail oriented and well organized. Not only can he find many people willing to attest to his technical experience but his character as well, which I think is more important. Throughout the process of working with Bobby he always went the extra mile when asked and didn't even question it. Overall, he is an outstanding professional who is the epitome of integrity in every sense of the word."
