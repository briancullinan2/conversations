                "I had sometime today to go through inbox messages. I have to be honest-I become frustrated. Connectiveness is a process and it takes time to develop interpersonal relationships. You can give as many compliments or romantic gestures as you want but if a women does not know you or is not into you-these sentiments are null and ineffective. It is actually a great way to get block and turn someone off. I speak straight from the ðŸ’œ because I do not have room for games. I am not on LinkedIn to date anyone. I am not the typical female either. I was raised mostly by my father so I think like a man in many ways. I go after the things I want including all relationships. I think things through to the NTH degree. Give me time to observe and get to know you. Please do not ask for personal recommendations if we do not know each other. I actually need to respect someone before a recommendation is given. Lastly, I am a clinician so many of my posts are to bring forth advocacy, awareness, self-care and for educational purposes on a global level. Please be respectful of my wishes. Once you are in my life, I am loyal to the end.",
