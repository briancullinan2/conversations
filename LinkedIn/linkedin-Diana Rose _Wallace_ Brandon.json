        "summary": "    What is your process to create content for your audience? I start with the end.I believe you must first consider both who the audience is and what you want them to do. It’s only by determining those end results that you can know how to begin.For about 20 years, I’ve been an accomplished creative communications professional, writer, brand & marketing strategist and producer.  I create strategies for internal and external audiences, and translate complex information into understandable, relatable and actionable content.  I’m directly experienced in technology, tourism, education, healthcare, home building, retail and fashion. I have years of brand, advertising and publicity experience (and both digital and analog portfolios to show for it.)I co-created Litróf Consulting with Scott Marshall Brandon to bring to organizations the business acumen and strategic planning that leads to successful innovation.  Litróf works with international organizations in commerce, education, medicine, and culture to help create environments where innovation can thrive and they can also deliver social good benefits. Core Strengths: Marketing and Communications Strategy, Copywriting, Brand Creation and Development, Advertising Campaign Ideation, Public Relations, Social Media, Video Concept and Scripting, Budgeting, Online and Email Marketing, Photography and Content Production, Managing Teams & Developing StaffOf the many achievements I’m proud of, one of the best for me was helping significantly increase adoptions of hard-to-adopt animals at Arizona Humane Society by volunteering photography. I also created and taught a class for other volunteers to assist the effort.\n  \n  \n",
