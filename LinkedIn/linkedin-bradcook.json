                "I worked with Nick for over 7 years at Godaddy.com.  During this time Nick consistently demonstrated his professionalism and desire to operate at the highest level on a consistent basis.  We were primarily in sales positions and Nick and I were two of the top performers in the company.  We constantly pushed each other to be the best that we could be and I am very grateful for the many things that I learned that came from this process.  I look forward to working with Nick again in the future and I know that any company that has him is very lucky."
