The downside was a 2 hour commute every day, and not really my ideal position. On top of that, I'm expecting to hear back from another job tomorrow that would be more of what I actually wanted to do, and would be direct-hire and only a 15-30 minute commute a day. I was honest with the recruiter about the other job, and he informed me that I had to make a decision right then and there. Not much time to think about it. The recruiter seemed puzzled when I respectfully declined. Yes, I am aware that there is a fair chance that I won't get the job I actually want and be back to square one, but I still felt pretty good about not compromising my time away from my family and keeping my integrity in tact. I know they say you should take whatever comes at you so you can \"get your foot in the door\", but I've been a part of the work force a very long time. I think I've earned the right to hold out for the job I truly want.",
