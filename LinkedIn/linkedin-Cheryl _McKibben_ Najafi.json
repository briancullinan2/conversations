She is currently working on her third book, ‘The Einkorn Wheat Diet: Have Your Cake and Eat it Too!’ which is a testament that you don’t have to go gluten-free, spend hours at the gym, or give up the foods you love to achieve the health benefits and physique you desire.Cheryl spent the last two decades nurturing both her passion for nutrition and her food sensibility, which necessitates developing nutritious, dependable home-cooked meals. Her motto? Just get in the kitchen! Because…when you eat the bulk of your meals from the fridge as opposed to fast food restaurants or your pantry, ingredients are fresh, nutrient-dense and delicious.  As a busy working mother of three, she pursues developing fresh, time-saving recipes to keep her family and yours healthy and happy. Of course, with her penchant for cookie dough bites, she believes the 80/20 rule is the only way to go!"

CherylStyle is not a typical organization.

He was charged with turning subjects typically relegated to the index section in most books (such as how to buy a grill) into playful twists giving each grill type a name and persona.  So the grills became men of all walks of life, and buying a grill became an exercise in finding a new friend! There wasn't a challenge or task we gave Gary that he wasn't eagerly willing to take on.  I think his biggest legacies are the murder mysteries he wrote for a business pitch and then another for my daughter's Pink Flamingo Softball Party where the murder takes place on the softball field.   Gary's zest for creativity and enthusiasm for new and exciting opportunities make him a perfect fit for the CherylStyle team.
