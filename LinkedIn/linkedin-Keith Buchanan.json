                "The SL Mining VRMMORPG is a Work and Business Life  simulation where participants can produce resources and lindens, (real $), by Pick-mining rocks, Lumber-jacking, Smelting, Researching, Cooking, Eating, Praying, Exercising, Swimming, Snorkeling, Deep-sea diving, Astronomy, Star Data Research, Planetary Data Research,  Alien EBE Interaction, ISBE Perception Research, Crafting, Trading, and so much more.       The concept of the simulation goes much deeper then most realize at first, because unlike most Second Life land traffic systems, the land owners/rock owners aren’t just the purchasers of land traffic, they are part of the simulation and can use the Land Owner point system to access unique tools to sell to visitors or use themselves. The skills and stats they gain increase resource production thus producing more craft-able tools to sell or trade to other participants, offsetting traffic costs and eventually profiting with benefit of the traffic too.Read more bout it in the FAQ: https://workwithaccess.com/faq/Have a great VR work day!",

        "summary": "           I was born with a very rare gift called arthrogryposis, and am not burdened with the  use of my arms/hands like most are. I type and code with my tongue and up to 36WPM.      To give you a little background, I started with computers back in 1984 writing programs in basic on an Atari 800 with a 300 baud modem given to me by my Uncle who worked for the company at that time.     I've never worked for anyone else but myself before and over the last 30 years have studied many different programming languages, technologies, and platforms. This has all lead to my latest project, a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Game with a Free Market Real Cash Economy built on the Second Life platform. It's now in Open Beta so come check it out.      I'd love to chat and share ideas, drop me a message anytime!\n  \n  \n",
