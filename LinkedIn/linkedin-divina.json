There is no person that would not benefit from her gentle touch.She will change you. Not by telling you what to do or how to live, but by seeing through you into who you can be and inviting you to see it, too.She has helped me through relationship issues - both romantic and interpersonal, unraveled the mysteries of my debilitating anxiety during my time living in Manhattan, helped me *deeply* understand my emotions and connect with them, guided me to rebuild myself when I was weak and see others from a place of compassion.
