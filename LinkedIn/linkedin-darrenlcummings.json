                "In today’s “digital everything” world, all companies have an acute need to modernize their operations and offerings through technology platforms and are forced to become an information technology company. Often this realization leads to distraction, cost and ambiguous strategies on how to deliver their core value to their customers leading to less profit. Architecting and selecting technology is also difficult. Traditional platforms, those that exist in the market today, are by and large bound the the “domain” for which they were constructed to serve. These domains include: Realtime (Information), Knowledge (“Big Data & Analytics) or Wisdom (Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc). The architectures for these various domains drastically differ and have significant impact on customer experience and the business's capability to deliver the required product or service to their end-user in a time/cost efficient manner.The SolidIntelligence platform collapses the three “domain bound” unique architectures into one agile platform and was designed for agile extension and scale regardless of the specific market or vertical our customers act in. Leveraging unique “TimeWarp(™)  Technology”, Solid Intelligence delivers a rich ’digital insight’ capability to ultimately connect people to the services they need by converging mobile connectivity,  big-data & analytic backend, and machine learning into one cost-effective, cloud based platform. By gaining access to our platform and the engineering services we provide, our customers are able to realize operational efficiencies in their ITOPS and accelerate their time to market with new product & services offerings leading to a bottom line impact. SolidIntelligence represents the newest and most modern way to approach the market need of gaining access to a robust platform to connect their products and services to their consumers and customers."
