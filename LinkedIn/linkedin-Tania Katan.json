                "This #FinancialFeministFriday we’re recognizing soccer all-star and equal pay and LGBTQ activist, Abby Wambach. Since 2015, Abby has been instrumental in leading US women’s soccer’s fight for equal pay. Abby is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, World Cup champion, and record holder of most goals scored by any player, man or woman, in international competition (184 goals, nbd). But there’s one win she didn’t capture during her soccer career: closing the gender pay gap. This year, thanks to efforts made by many team members, the women’s soccer team signed a new contract that narrowed their gap, but they still earn less despite regularly outperforming the men’s team. (Sound familiar?) In retirement Abby continues to take on the gender pay gap — and not just in soccer. “I think when you’re stuck inside of it you don’t even know how unfairly you’re being treated. As any woman or a gay woman, you can’t have that feeling of you’re just going to take what you can get.” Abby may be retired, but she continues to work tirelessly on closing the gender pay gap. She’s an MVP in our book (and should be in yours too).",
