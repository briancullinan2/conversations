He is a very intelligent and experienced person who understand the business of IT Operations on the operational, tactical and strategic level and is also capable to relate them to each other within Operations but also to other business processes in the company and the market. David has a very good approach to problems or issues on all levels. Every time he knows exactly what and very clear what to ask to activate others to come up with analysis and solutions, or to work towards solutions. The nicest part is that people in the company follow this behavior and are automatically doing the same.  The same with supplier/vendor management not only in the USA but also in Europe, David knows exactly what to ask to get things arranged or done. He is very capable to switch very quickly between the several levels in our business and is very result, cost, customer and pro-active driven without the risk of losing customers or people in the company. Between David and me there are differences in intelligent level, experience, language and culture.  I never experienced a problem with this. David knows exactly how to handle this by giving space and time and stimulates interaction between the two of us and others.
