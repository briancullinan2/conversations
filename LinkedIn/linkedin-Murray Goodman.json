        "summary": "    Great leads is what every company strives for to generate significant revenues.  Having a business development team set qualified appointments to keep sales executives consistently in front of new opportunities not only serves to grow revenues and bottom line profits, it also mitigates the peaks and valleys experienced by all sales teams.  Lead generation and appointment setting may be the smartest way to increase revenue quickly.  The best problem a business can have is controlling the growth in sales to be in line with ability to fulfill.  Excess capacity disappears, making use of every company asset to drive up profits.  As Chief Operating Officer,  I can assure you that Intelemark's Business Development Team strives to deliver greater revenue opportunities than you might think possible.  At Intelemark, our team puts our clients' sales executives in front of the biggest companies in the world such as Xerox, 3M Company, Abbott Laboratories, American Express, Apple Inc., Bank of America, etc.  When it comes to building new business,  I invite you to discuss how quickly Intelemark can deliver new sales opportunities for your business.  An informative conversation can help determine whether to engage Intelemark  as your inside sales team.  Intelemark will generate the appointments with key decision makers for your business to thrive and keep your sales people constantly selling!\n  \n  \n",
