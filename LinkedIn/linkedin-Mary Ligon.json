All that is needed is the courage and determination to discover the fastest path through the minefield of self-doubt and fear within and to focus tenaciously on the end game.\"  For as long as I can remember, I've been insatiably curious about human potential. I wanted to know, what exactly makes people genuinely happy, successful and creatively fulfilled?Why do some people struggle while others find a way to thrive, often despite the most challenging circumstances? This lead me to the study of hypnosis, NLP and many other teachings that focused on utilizing the incredible inner resources that are available to us, but not usually taught in traditional colleges.  I have traveled the world teaching and coaching people. My students and coaching clients learn to use the power of their mind and advanced communication techniques to be happy, creative, productive and fulfilled.  They discover how to follow their true inner nature and how to express it through the way they live life and relate to others. I have had the good fortune of being a part of turning lives and careers around. I have clients that have worked with me consistently for over 15 years. Why?  Because they get consistent and measurable results in their business, career and personal lives.    For the last twenty four years I have been helping people create extraordinary lives and businesses with these powerful techniques. \n  \n  \n",
