        "summary": "    Given the recruiting industry has many players, the market is filled with a lot of noise and conflicting information, especially around recruiting fees and success statistics. Employers seem to think they are limited to a recruiting model based on a candidate’s compensation. In the new economy, employers were asking for a recruiting solution that was more efficient and cost effective...so we introduced a different model and it's not based on a candidate's compensation! As a result, we are saving our clients over 50% in traditional search fees.When we say “Recruitment Redefined” they are not just words, they are reality for our clients. While we are headquartered in Phoenix, we have a national presence and in the last few years have expanded globally working in Europe, Asia, and Brazil.Working directly with clients to staff large scale projects involving multiple hires, developing outsourcing models and revamping staffing departments.
