        "summary": "    “As an Emergency Room doctor, I routinely saw patients with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. I was always deeply troubled by how little could be done.I was also troubled that so often the only treatment we could offer was medication. At best, these were just temporary fixes.Now, with new developments in brainwave biofeedback, particularly Clarity Neurofeedback, there is finally an effective way to treat most of these patients. Clarity is a very significant medical breakthrough, one of the most important I have seen in all my years of medical training and practice.”Specialties: Clarity Neurofeedback practitioner. Clarity helps treat the following disorders: ADD/ADHD, anxiety, depression, autism, learning disabilities, addictions, PTSD and traumatic brain injuries.\n  \n  \n",
