                "Working with Bill Curtis has been a delight! He had the challenge of not only leading a team of pioneers, but the team was also remote. He found a way to strike a balance of allowing team members operate in and develop personal strengths while keeping them \"at home\" with regular team meetings and 1-on-1 conversations. With each and every challenge, Bill always maintained a positive outlook, and I found he had a way to draw the good out of any circumstance. More than that, Bill's diverse professional background served us well. He was regularly coming up with new ideas and strategies that enabled the team to \"do more with less.\" I cannot recommend Bill enough. If you have any questions about my experience with Bill, feel free to call me at 720-722-2761. Warm Regards,Travis Campbell"
