        "summary": "    My name is Hamin Tiger Phillips, I like to live by the motto that 10% of the bad things you may have gone through in life is just plain ole LIFE! However the other 90% is what are you going to DO about it?! I am the son of a struggling entrepreneur and small business owner. As a kid I had a vision, I wanted to be successful and live the American Dream. So I chased it, I had my hand in everything from turn key businesses, modeling and even gave acting a try.However, no matter how hard I tried to succeed I seemed to be getting nowhere. Have you ever heard the saying that \"Gods plan is bigger than your own\"? Well it’s kind of true lol, it wasn't in till I found my fruit tree that I realized what I was truly good at. Everybody is a fruit tree and the fruit you bare may not be the fruit you wish to grow. But you will soon find that once you stop uprooting yourself and stay planted, success is no longer something you have to chase.I enjoy the possibilities of making a living online, I feel like as long as you have a computer and a dream anything is possible!\n  \n  \n",
