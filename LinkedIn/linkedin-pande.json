                "(This reco is long time coming.)Sudip is one of the most thoughtful engineers I've seen. With every project that he drives to closure, he applies very careful introspection (would more than often tell me to stop messing around). Validating everything to the utmost detail possible, is something that everyone truly appreciates.Along with this, Sudip ramped up on very complex projects (with minimal help) very quickly. This also highlights his ability to dive deep into technologies in times of crisis, and strike down problems.Finally, a rare quality to find, Sudip is extremely curious. Always trying to find out how something works (and this isn't just about work - even so in his personal life). I truly value his ability to figure things out, and so does everyone else around him.Here's to a bright career of this gentleman. :)"
