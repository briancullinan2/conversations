                "I am honored to recommend Andrew. Andrew served as an intern for Ideate Vision during Fall 2016 - Spring 2017. During his time with our company, he was self-driven, he completed work remotely with minimal direction, and helped to shape the social media brands we represent. Andrew also attended conferences on behalf of the team, in order to keep a pulse on industry trends. I was impressed with his ability to follow direction, and to quickly respond to our team communication. He stepped into a leadership role, suggesting opportunities to improve the team, and our client brands. I highly recommend him for any position he pursues."
