        "summary": "    I’m a cross-functional project manager with 10+ years of experience across various industries including adventure / outdoor recreation, entertainment, healthcare, and financial services. I combine my analytical finance background with my strong interpersonal skills to bring ideas to life.I’m passionate about how people interact with the mechanical and natural world. Specifically, I have 10+ years experience working in the outdoor recreation space - I’ve designed and constructed stunts and challenges for a variety of TV shows (American Grit, Big Brother, Amazing Race, American Ninja Warrior). I also have 7+ years experience in team-building and leadership development including leading outdoors programs for clients including Microsoft, 3M, Yahoo, and the Boys & Girls Club.I founded my own outdoors adventure startup in 2011 and completely bootstrapped the idea. We quickly became profitable after making different growth bets scaling across e-commerce marketplaces (LivingSocial). I helped us scale our finance/operations and also hired our team of five. Ultimately, we led programs for over 5,000 groups of individuals as well as clients like Toyota, Kia Motors, Aramark, and actor Jared Leto to name a fewI’m also a tech geek. I dabble in coding and am proficient CAD designer. Message me if there’s a common interest - always looking to jump on interesting projects!\n  \n  \n",
