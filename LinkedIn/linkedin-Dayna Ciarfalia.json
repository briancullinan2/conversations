Not only does she bring an awesome spirit and a yearning for growth, but she also brings a unique ability to find and connect with great candidates! She is extremely pleasant to work with, always up for helping out the newbies, and consistently willing to dedicate the time and effort needed to get the job done! Oh, and she introduced me to pineapple and Tajin (which has pretty much changed my life). ;-)"

        "summary": "    I LOVE what I do (and I'm not just saying that because everyone else does). For years, though, I struggled to figure out who I was and what impact I was going to make on the world. In 2010, fresh out of college, I moved to Arizona from a small town of 315 in Northern Minnesota (extra points for anyone who's actually heard of Taconite). Within less than year of making the move, I went through a HUGE life change, which forced me to start from scratch in figuring out who and what I wanted to be.By 2013, I had discovered my love for helping people better understand, appreciate, and market who they are and what they have to offer. My natural skills in connecting the dots, matching IT (particularly dev) talent to companies, and having an incessant desire to exceed expectations make me someone you want to work with. I also LOVE Phoenix's Startup community and am the host of the Startup Land series of the Dawn of the Devs podcast.
