        "summary": "    While many of us prefer to step into a well-paved scenario, I enjoy the make-or-break, fresh blueprint pressure of developing a new organization or new product. As a competitive entrepreneur,’ I love to step in and start production immediately. Energy produces energy and you will not stumble upon something great if you are not moving forward.I live in the moment. I do not see the future as a fixed destination. Instead, I see it as a place that you create out of the choices you make right now. I discover the future onechoice at a time. This doesn’t mean that I do not have plans, I do. My strength of Adaptability enables me to respond willingly to the demands of the moment even if they pull meaway from my plans. Unlike many, I do not resent sudden requests or unforeseen detours, I expect them because they are inevitable. On some level I actually look forward to them. At heart, I am a very flexible person who can stay productive when the demands of work are pulling me inmany different directions at once.\n  \n  \n",
