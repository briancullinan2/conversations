I work closely with business stakeholders and end-users to assess business impacting situations. I then go deep to discover the real core of the problem, which may not be immediately clear. I analyze possible solutions, select the best fit, and then rapidly deliver solutions that grow productivity and streamline efficiency with little to no business impact or downtime. In addition, I develop extremely robust designs that provide the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. I possess particular strengths in \"connecting the dots\" to ensure that key systems including hardware, scanners, printers and other devices are fully integrated with database solutions. This ability enables me to ensure that internal / external customers have the data they need when they need it. In addition to my technical strengths, I'm personable, and work effectively with stakeholders across the organization. End-users know they can come to me with their technical issues because they realize that I'm genuinely committed to making their work lives more productive. \n  \n  \n",
