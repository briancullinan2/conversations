On the first meeting I was really impressed with his ability to take a concept he was unfamiliar with, and provide ideas to improve the company.  I soon realized that he would be an extremely valuable asset, so I quickly asked him to join me as co-founder and Elite Tee was born.  By utilizing the software he created we were able to build a company that is being used by over a thousand private country clubs across the country.  He is extremely organized and completes projects quickly and efficiently.
