A little backstory… For 8 months I struggled to find a position in my career field through another recruiting agency that I had been referred to. With that agency, I had to drive a long distance to interview with them before interviewing with a potential employer, take multiple rigorous tests with them, I couldn’t use my pre-existing portfolio, and I was asked to complete complex samples of work with short notice and short deadline despite my work schedule. I also interviewed with multiple companies they attempted to place me with that weren’t the best fit for me… That agency didn’t seem to really listen to or understand what I offer, and it was a lot of wasted time and stress. It was an ENTIRELY different story with Mark. He actually found me on LinkedIn, and he respected my professionalism. He is a great communicator - highly accessible, and very accommodating! Mark submitted me to two companies without requiring an interview with him first, using my portfolio, and I was placed with a company that the previous recruiter had failed with! I converted from contract to hire; and it truly feels like I belong here with consideration to the work my position entails, opportunity for growth, a respectable salary, and an ideal atmosphere! I really didn’t think such a great position with such a great company existed, and I LOVE my job! My quality of life has DRASTICALLY improved, like night and day! Thank you so much Mark!"

                "Mark Gordon helped me get hired on to my dream job! He is a lifesaver! A little backstory… For 8 months I struggled to find a position in my career field through another recruiting agency that I had been referred to. With that agency, I had to drive a long distance to interview with them before interviewing with a potential employer, take multiple rigorous tests with them, I couldn’t use my pre-existing portfolio, and I was asked to complete complex samples of work with short notice and short deadline despite my work schedule. I also interviewed with multiple companies they attempted to place me with that weren’t the best fit for me… That agency didn’t seem to really listen to or understand what I offer, and it was a lot of wasted time and stress. It was an ENTIRELY different story with Mark. He actually found me on LinkedIn, and he respected my professionalism. He is a great communicator - highly accessible, and very accommodating! Mark submitted me to two companies without requiring an interview with him first, using my portfolio, and I was placed with a company that the previous recruiter had failed with! I converted from contract to hire; and it truly feels like I belong here with consideration to the work my position entails, opportunity for growth, a respectable salary, and an ideal atmosphere! I really didn’t think such a great position with such a great company existed, and I LOVE my job! My quality of life has DRASTICALLY improved, like night and day! Thank you so much Mark!"
