I also discovered what aspects of business I can cover, and some I am not really suited for.

This was necessary as the team was accepted into an accelerator program called The Brandery. My first responsibility was building the front-end, customer-facing web portal. However, being a part of a small startup means I touched pretty much every piece of the Modulus infrastructure. Not only did I accelerate my web development experience and knowledge by 10 fold, but I was mentored by some of the best minds in the entrepreneurship world during this time. This taught me invaluable lessons in business, marketing, and even a little financing. It was a lot of long nights and endless networking, but I would not trade those years for anything."

        "summary": "    <body>Software is in my blood. Since my father helped me write my first program when I was 12, I was hooked.  I have worked in PHP, ASP, C#, and many other languages. I love learning and trying new things, so I tend to branch out to new ones from time to time. Over the years I found my real passion lies in web development. Front-end development to be exact. To go from a blank canvas to a web page that the world can enjoy always makes me proud. I have experience with full-stack work, but I usually just do what needs to be done to get things running. I really prefer the comfort of my HTML/CSS/JS. I also co-organize TucsonJS, which has been fun. Currently open to employment and consulting.</body>\n  \n  \n",
