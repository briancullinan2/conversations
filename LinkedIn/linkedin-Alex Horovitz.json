I really wish I'd run into more people when interviewing that think and act like Alex. He never got stuck on the fact that I didn't have formal computer science background for a moment. He could care less, but was genuinely interested in what I had done so far, how I'd gotten there, where I wanted to go next and what motivated me. He never quizzed me with silly gotchas and was confident in me before even hiring me. It was very refreshing to not feel as if I was auditioning. At the time, Alex had already assembled a dream team (family) of engineers who'd been writing Objective-C decades before the iPhone's debut. I knew I was in the presence of greatness and was a bit intimidated, thinking I had no chance of joining the team. Alex eased my concerns and was very welcoming, complementing my achievements and ensuring I deserved to be there, just before making me an offer. I've never been so excited to join a team. Months later Alex made sure that I went to my first WWDC! The confidence in my own abilities he fostered, forever shaped my career. Every interaction was a pleasure and I would highly recommend Alex for any team. I hope that we can one day work together again."
