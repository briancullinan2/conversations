                "ContentEngine is born in 1996 as International Media Services (IMS), a Latin America-focused media services company operating in 18 countries throughout Mexico, Central and South America. In its inception, IMS was a clipping service, providing hard copy clips from print newspapers and magazines in Latin America to multinational corporations for research, intelligence and corporate communications purposes.In 1997, IMS incorporated Global Network Content Services (GNCS) to license news content from newspaper publishing groups strictly using digital delivery methods – the concept was to move from the print editions to digital delivery making news aggregation fast, reliable and cost efficient. The new process would also allow access to the digital versions of the publications. The concept was to have the digital editions of Latin America’s largest newspapers and magazines available in customer platforms before the print editions hit the streets.By 2006, news from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, among other countries, was being syndicated to Dow Jones, LexisNexis, ProQuest, Thomson Reuters and others. In 2008, Canada’s largest private equity group OMERS Private Equity and Marketwired acquired GNCS. In 2016, GNCS became a part of NASDAQ.In 2016, Hector Botero, the founder of GNCS launched ContentEngine to expand the library of titles available with a greater focus on legal, scientific and economic content. ContentEngine offers more than 300 titles (publications) updated daily.. ContentEngine licenses content exclusively to subscription-based professional research services including Artificial Intelligence applications. Distribution is strictly controlled.Our newswire, www.iCrowdNewswire.com with over 40,000 releases in its first two years continues to grow"
