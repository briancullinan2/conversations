        "summary": "    Hello! My name is Kristi and I am the HR Assistant for Shop Priceless Fashion Company. I love to interact with clientele and I have a talent for building strong rapport. I graduated cum laude from ASU in December 2013 with my B.S. in Family and Human Development. Prior to graduating from ASU, I worked in the hospitality industry as a bartender and server. Working in this industry from the ages of 16-21 allowed me to build excellent customer service and communication skills that have been vital to my professional growth.In addition to my full time role with Shop Priceless, I co-own an online boutique clothing and accessory shop, 'BratLife,' a line for young women ages 12-21.  I also have a strong passion and history of working with developmentally disabled youth. This includes experience in children and family services. Having three siblings on the autism spectrum has heavily impacted my life and I am emotionally invested in the cause of Autism Awareness.Please do not hesitate to message me, I appreciate each invitation for connection!\n  \n  \n",
