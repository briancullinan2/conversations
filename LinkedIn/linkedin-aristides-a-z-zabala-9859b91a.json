I greatly value creativity, diversity, building winning cultures, and win-win relationships.  I’ve inspired team transformations to lead to significant increased sales performance.  I have hired, trained, and developed recognized top sales talent and teams.  I’ve sponsored the establishment of plans, processes, and strategies for initiating new and innovative sales organizations.  I thrive to inspire and uplift those around me while I garner virtues from them.  I have been fortunate enough to manage small and large sales teams (from 3-41), and mange budgets of $650K-78M.  I’m completely enthralled by music, and study all types of elements of it when time permits.  And, I enjoy bringing that same level of passion and enjoyment with me in my career wherever I go.\n  \n  \n",
