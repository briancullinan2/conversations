Although Jan was new to the industry, he seamlessly translated his financial expertise and consultant experience in the satellite industry to deftly breakdown the workings of my company and our competitive environment. The overall result of Jan’s analysis was a report including key projections of the company’s growth. We have since been successful at raising sufficient capital to begin fulfilling these projections.  During my first experience working with Jan I not only benefited from having the task at hand completed, which was drafting the amortization of the mortgage on our factory, but was also impressed with the ease at which he introduced me to technical solutions for communication issues within the constraints of Nicaraguan internet access. This was just brushing the surface, and from what I later recognized, Jan’s analytical skills and adaptability far exceeds that of previous Harvard M.B.A. graduates that I have hired. Jan deftly organized and analyzed the key performance indicators regarding my company here in Nicaragua, the constraints and strengths of conducting business here, and market entry into the United States and Canada. He developed a target customer base, drew together research on market indicators, and developed financial forecasts accordingly. From conducting this analysis, Jan drew together vital recommendations that he made for our business plan that we are now carrying out. Alongside Jan’s notable business and worldly acumen, he is quick-witted, personable, demonstrates an outstanding work ethic, and is a strong leader. Jan managed the Market Analysis and Corporate Social Responsibility intern throughout her time with us. He was well aware of what sort of supervision was needed when, between exhibiting patience while she worked through daily trials on research and surveys for the report, and spelling out the foundations of the analysis to facilitate research when her aptitude was limited."
