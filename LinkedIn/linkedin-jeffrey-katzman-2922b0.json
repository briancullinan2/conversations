It was the first to automatically disaggregate learning content into reusable chunks of content. Imagine a textbook being broken up by chapters, and chapters into topics, and topics into subtopics, and subtopics being broken up into it's atomic elements like figures, text, movies, questions. Each object from as small as a paragraph, to a full chapter, could be reused and recombined with other objects to create new collections of content.It was also the first to use XML to separate content from it's presentation thus enabling the same content to be transformed into print and web-based learning formats."

        "summary": "    For the last 20+ years, I've been thinking about how technology can enhance and enrich education. In my career as an educational technologist, product designer and entrepreneur, I have founded two market-leading educational technology companies. Prior to founding my current company Core Learning Exchange, I was a founder and executive at Xyleme, where I envisioned a learning platform and helped grow it to become the market leading Learning Content Management System used by some of the world's most respected corporations, consultancies, and higher education institutions.All the while, I am also a father of 2 students in the K12 system and I have witnessed the irony having technologically savvy children lugging backpacks filled with outdated textbooks, and photocopied assignments. Finally, after 50 years of stagnation, the US education system is at the cusp of a radical transformation. I find this very exciting and am compelled to apply my experience and knowledge to help re-imagine teaching and learning in the digital age. This is why I founded Core Learning Exchange.The Core Learning Exchange is a self-sustaining business that matches crowd-sourced learning and teaching materials with the teachers that need it to implement personalized learning, and blended learning programs.
