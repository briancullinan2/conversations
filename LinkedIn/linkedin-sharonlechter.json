While the steps to success are the same for men and women, we approach those steps very differently.  The original Think and Grow Rich was written during a time when only men were titans in business. This book for women, honors Napoleon Hill and looks at his principles for success through the eyes of successful women.  Over 300 women are celebrated and share their stories in this thought provoking and timely message.  Visit www.thinkandgrowrichforwomen.com for more information, to order and to receive special gifts. The book is to be released on June 17, 2014."
