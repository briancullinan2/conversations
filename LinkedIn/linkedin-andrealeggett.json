Andrea combines a solid understanding of the fluid dynamics of the business, the savvy understanding needed to navigate within a complex organization and a friendly, outgoing demeanor to boot!  Andrea is a pleasure to work with and has a \"get things done\" attitude that makes her a powerful part of any marketing team.  Hence my recommendation."

Leonard’s hard work and dedication played a major factor in keeping our department of 50+ people moving efficiently. His organizational skills were exemplary and his ability to keep our busy meeting calendars on track along with his special skills in handling heavy travel requirements made him a strong asset to our team and to our VP. Leonard maintained a great balance of hard work, professionalism, and a great sense of humor. Leonard left after four rounds of layoffs when the department could only keep three employees.
