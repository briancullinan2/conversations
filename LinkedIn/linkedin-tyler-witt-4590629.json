After working closely with Tyler over the course of the past year, I see Tyler as someone who should be leading an entire sales floor as a director, and at this point would be underutilized leading a small team. Tyler's ability to coach, train, and mentor his team his bar none - he is truly an expert in the Sales Process (don't even get him started on 'Discovery'). Not only can he \"do\" but he can also teach others in a way that is easily consumable and repeatable, so that reps can leave his training and instantly apply it. Because of this, his team was constantly developing and improving. Not many managers possess this skill, and that's where I see many fall flat. Tyler always used data to his advantage to pinpoint where to spend his time coaching and leading his team, whether he was pulling it himself or using his resources around him. What I truly valued about working with Tyler was that he always had solutions to the problems he was bringing me, and these solutions impacted more than just his team, but the business as a whole. On top of all of the above, Tyler's business acumen, energy, intuition, and resourcefulness made him the go-to guy whenever our acting director was absent. I would recommend Tyler time and time again in any capacity, but especially if you are looking to grow your sales team and bottom line.

                "There are sales managers who merely \"talk\" that they can get things done and then there are sales leaders who \"do.\" It is an injustice of words merely to say that Tyler firmly fits in with the latter. Simply put, Tyler is the consummate sales professional who relishes and thrives in the tactics of the sales process and also has the smarts to get above the trees and craft a solid strategy for an entire organization.
