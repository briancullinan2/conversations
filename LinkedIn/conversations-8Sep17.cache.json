If you would like me to come in any time to help or schedule another interview just let me know! I have tons of material to study to start getting up to speed. I took down some hardware names to look into. If there is anything else you need to make an informed decision, or I am happy to come in tomorrow to help. Which reminds me, how long do you plan to be in Phoenix? Looking forward to seeing you again.\n\n-Brian",
