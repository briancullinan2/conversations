In addition to my academic endeavors at Duke, I was elected captain of the Track and Field team and competed in the hammer throw. Saying I’m a “car guy” is a significant understatement! While I love a wide variety of exotic sports cars, I’m a Porsche enthusiast at heart. Martial arts have always been a big part of his life. I’ve been training in the Korean art of Tang Soo Do since the age of three years and continue to train and teach. I currently do business out of the Phoenix office in the Southwest Division of North Star Resource Group where I focuses my efforts on building long term meaningful relationships with professionals in the medical space as well as with a variety of business owners. Utilizing a comprehensive approach, I embrace my clients’ unique financial goals while focusing on their long term strategic plans.\n  \n  \n",
