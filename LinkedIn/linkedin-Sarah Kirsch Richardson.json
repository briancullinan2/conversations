As Founder of the rapidly growing brokerage Tru Realty, she is responsible for the multiple growth avenues the company is pursuing. Sarah began Tru Realty in 2010 to take advantage of an unexploited change in the Arizona marketplace, the shift from auction-centric to MLS-centric fix/flip deal flow. By testing an idea and building a solid team of capital lenders, general contractors, investors, and other specialists unique to each deal she reached the 450 deal mark in Six years - most of which had been profitable yielding double digit returns. While focused on flipping, Sarah also delivered to traditional Buyers and Sellers and was recognized as the top.5% of agents for several years.As flip spreads have tightened, Sarah's expertise is still finding success for her clients but she has expanded her team of agents to focus on the traditional side of residential real estate. By implementing cloud technology solutions to keep costs lean, a sliding fee scale based on performance that keeps agents motivated with more money in their pocket, and a leading mentor ship program to reiterate the Tru methodology of customer service; Tru Realty is growing fast and Sarah is leading the Tru team and brand to great things.Sarah was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin and moved to Arizona in 1996 where she attended Arizona State University and studied Business Communications. In 2003, she shifted from her corporate path into real estate when she was licensed and became a member of the National Association of Realtors. She initially specialized in Commercial, Retail Shopping Center Leasing and Sales, and ultimately moved into Wholesale and Residential Real Estate before founding Tru Realty.  Sarah Is a vendor and member of the Scottsdale Chapter Women's Council of Realtors and is also spearheading Tru Gives;  Tru Realty's charity that grants scholarships for preschool.\n  \n  \n",
