She is loved by all, respected by all, and without tooting my own horn---she has a great eye for talent.  From her humble perch in Phoenix she tracks down and nurtures developing talent---at least she did with me.  She found me about 5 years ago and stuck with me thru the wins and the losses.  She is smart, sophisticated and incredibly calming.  Don't let her fool ya---Paula knows her shit---and while she may not know how to force quit her computer she knows what's important in this business and life---relationships, loyalty, and smart hard work.

She is loved by all, respected by all, and without tooting my own horn---she has a great eye for talent.  From her humble perch in Phoenix she tracks down and nurtures developing talent---at least she did with me.  She found me about 5 years ago and stuck with me thru the wins and the losses.  She is smart, sophisticated and incredibly calming.  Don't let her fool ya---Paula knows her shit---and while she may not know how to force quit her computer she knows what's important in this business and life---relationships, loyalty, and smart hard work.  I hope Paula and I have many years ahead as partners."
