That's it.  Just pick one, right?  You know it doesn't work that way.  Adam found himself in this very same position in his career, and he handled it in a way that turned figures on paper into real people with tremendous personal contributions to their new telecommunications company, with goal-setting and goal achievements that rewarded them more than they otherwise would ever have imagined.  He made it all work for his customers, for his company, and more importantly, for hundreds of new business and technology sales people entering a sales organization that Mr. Orzol made more confident, more comfortable, and more competitive than they had ever been at any other time in their careers.Prior to Joining Verizon Wireless, Mr. Orzol's team facilitated my negotiation of a national Joint Marketing Alliance with Verizon Wireless.  I traveled from market to market with Verizon Wireless, showing customers and training their Data Solutions Managers to share with sales how to position ERP and data services to businesses to enhance the value of wireless data.  When I joined Verizon wireless myself, first in sales, then in sales management, having direct access to Mr. Orzol was like having a shot of Vitamin B-12 available for my deals and those of my team.My first year in sales at Verizon Wireless I made Winner's Circle (115% to quota).  My second year I made President's Cabinet (top 1-2% of sales in the USA) and was awarded in Switzerland.  This included a 463% to quota deal, thanks to a data-rich deal that Mr. Orzol (and of course, my manager Melodie Chan) had a very big part in.  It was a big win from a rival carrier, and I was able to convince our new customer that the additional $ per year with our company was justified because they received the value of our network as well as Mr. Orzol who was just a phone call away, in addition the the rest of our team.  In my third year, I took over my team, and in my fourth year, I added two regional vertical teams to track and coach.  Performance like that takes a team behind you for support.  A great manager (Melodie Chan), a great Regional Team Leader & Data Sales Manager, B2B (Adam Orzol).  You could not ask for a better trained, more dedicated, better performing group of women and men available at a moment's notice to help bring partners to the table or help support or close deals.I would strongly suggest hiring Mr. Orzol for any position that you are considering him for.  He is professional, personable, and brings a wealth of knowledge and experience with him well beyond his years."
