I have the connections, resources and experience to get your name out to the community. I'll get you in front of the right people. Local Influencer:  Looking for a local influncer to tell your story? I'm your girl! Whether you have a product or service that you'd like my community to know about, we'll create a story that involves me sharing my experience with my audience.

Consulting: Want to understand how to grow business relationships? Have a local presence in the community? I've consulted for large companies, small companies, non-profits as well as solo-preneurs. It doesn't matter the size of the organization. From one-day high-level overview consulting sessions to multi-month projects, I'm here to help.Team training on networking and relationship building: Relationships are critical in order to achieve any level of success, especially for a sales revenue-producing environment. I will train your team on how to network and cultivate relationships that turn into clients. From a one-day training workshop to multi-month training sessions, I'm available to propel your team. Hire me to speak: I've delivered keynotes, presentations and workshops on the topic of networking, entrepreneurship and relationship building. Most recently I was humbled by the opportunity to do a local TEDx talk and share my message. I would love to speak to your organization. Let me know how I can add value to your event."
