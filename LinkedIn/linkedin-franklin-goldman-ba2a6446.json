His nature of treating everyone with the respect that they would deserve as a trusted friend is rare. As far as his technical ability and attention to detail along with his extensive art education skills (teaching level).His  knowledge of art supplies and techniques makes him in my professional opinion the most talented artist at any of the styles he decides to paint.After handling and framing  many of his originals it only takes one painting to notice NO BRUSHSTROKES AT ALL! He airbrushes but that's not the secret. His skill at mixing mediums and using only the best quality brushes and supplies. Along with extreme talent makes him the BEST at what he does. 5 STARS ***** FRANKLIN GOLDMAN"

        "summary": "    Launched my love of the arts with  Marvin Markman, where we catapulted his career throughcharity art promotions with his own unique innovative concepts. Franklin has since become President of an art promotion company and organized several artfestivals and events. He also assisted many other prominent local and successful artistsin his efforts to promote the arts through charitable and worthwhile causes. Artist Statement:While working as a gallery operator and picture framer, I have gained a tremendous senseof color and color coordination, as well as extensive artistic design. I have also seenand experienced a variety of art in every possible medium. Many trends have come and gone,but I feel the truly important artists change with the time, definitely not the trends.They develop new concepts in their minds and express it in their art. Ultimately, I want to become a true inspiration to young artists who feel they have obstacles to overcome, which create a lack of confidence in their artistic ability. I wantto encourage them to express their creativity and to prosper with my sponsorship andacknowledgement. Franklin Goldman's paintings are in several corporate and private collections Worldwide in Florida,New York and Hawaii. Home is where the art is!\n  \n  \n",
