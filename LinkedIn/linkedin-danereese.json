He came to the executive management team as a real shining star and maintained that status during his tenure there.  He truly 'gets' the people and business side of the recruiting/staffing business which is rare at the executive level.  He has the ability to take very little infrastructure and build it into something extremely profitable.  His ability to build a team and motivate them to achieve their best is a wonderful asset to any organization.  I have been in the staffing business for over 25 years and have been continually impressed with his facts and figures in regards to our industry.  He is one of the most informed and educated people I know who has the passion to get the job done.  I truly enjoyed the collaborative management style Dane has with his co-workers and his individual team.  I am confident that he will be an asset at any challenge he chooses."
