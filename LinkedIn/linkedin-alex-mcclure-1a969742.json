        "summary": "    My name is Alex McClure and I started capturing photographs when I was about 12, more than 30 years ago. I have been living in Tempe Arizona Since 1998 and I am passionate about photography as an art form. I am an Olympus Visionary,  NiSi Ambassador, Fotopro Ambassador Professional photographer, President of AZ Photo Guild. I get to shoot and teach people about photography. One of the most rewarding parts about helping others learn photography is when they have those \"ah-ha\" moments and capture that perfect shot.In my early years I fell in love with Landscape photography. Taking backpacking trips in the High Sierra, Cascade and Canadian Rocky Mountains - photographing everything from the Lake Louise and Columbian Ice fields to Yosemite Valley, Kings Canyon & Mount Whitney. But lately I have been photographing the Arizona/Utah desert, High Sierra & Grand Canyon. It has been really nice to focus on my art, photography.\n  \n  \n",
