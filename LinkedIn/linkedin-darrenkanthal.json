Alan is a true professional who was easily able to switch gears and manage both teams effectively by staying abreast and embracing the new while also remembering and maintaining the merits of the old.  From a recruiting perspective – Alan is as good as it gets.  He’s an active and engaged hiring manager who offered timely feedback and remained patient as we identified highly specialized candidates for hard to fill positions.  I would welcome the opportunity to work with Alan again and have every confidence he’ll be a successful hire on his next endeavor."
