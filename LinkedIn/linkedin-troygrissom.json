Last year my wife and I purchased a home in Arizona.  Had it not been for her assistance and constant tending of the various affairs and keeping our condo looking great, we would have made many trips to and from our home in Arizona.I will recommend Doris as a great real estate broker to my co-workers. She is willing to go beyond the expectations of a potential real estate buyer or seller. Doris provided us with outstanding advice about how to prepare our home for sale. She promptly returned all phone calls and had advertising in place as soon as possible. She worked hard, illustrated a great understanding of contract details, negotiation etiquette and documentation.We really appreciated Doris's calm reassurance and expert advice throughout the entire process. She was the outstanding professional we were looking for and having her work with us made a nerve-wracking negotiation a wonderful success!"
