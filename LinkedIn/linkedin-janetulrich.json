I have worked with Janet for over 5 years at Catholic Health Initiatives during which time she has served as a trainer, project manager, and system administrator.  Janet played a key role in our integration of Clarity and MS Project and is expert in both systems.  More important, Janet understands that the project management information system must be fully integrated with project management best practices and real world usage.  She not only managed multiple Clarity upgrades and implementations, but she used the tool to do so.
