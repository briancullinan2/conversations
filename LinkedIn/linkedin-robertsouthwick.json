Planned pack meetings for all scouts and their families to attend and participate, in addition to special camps, day camps, and kept on top of progress and achievements of all the scouts in the pack.Of course, I didn't do it alone, I had the best team of den leaders and volunteer staff working with me in their respective roles.One of my favorite duties was preparing, presenting, and awarding the Arrow of Light ceremony for a scout.One of the best compliments I got was after doing the popular Pinewood Derby race night, several parents came up to me and said it was the funnest, best, and frankly, amazingly organized Pinewood Derby they had ever been too.  Again, it was the small army of adult volunteers I had at each and every stage working in their respective roles to make it great."
