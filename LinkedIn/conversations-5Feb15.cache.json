    "message": "This is fantastic Brian\n\nWe would consider you an uber VIP. Uber VIPs receive a concierge like service. We can market an anonymous version of you and your desired comp to all the companies we work with (no downside reputation risk since it's anonymous) and then you can pick and choose what you are interested in. \n\nWe are not traditional recruiters. While we do these offline events, we are primary a software company founded by a developer who was tired of recruiters acting as gatekeepers to all the good opps.\n\nSo two things:\n\n1. If you want the uber VIP treatment send me your resume \n\n2. Register for the event either way. It runs from 11-2. Most people come for an hour during lunch. More info below via link. And use promo code \"LD\" for your comp: http://phoenix.jointriumph.com/talent/\n\nSent from my iPhone",
