                "I worked with Ric during my tenure at Pegasus Solutions as VP Sales and Account Management Asia Pacific.  As a direct report, he encourages you to constantly challenge yourself to reach your true potential.  He was very supportive of his team and makes great efforts to engage team members in different countries and to understand the cultural differences. He took time to travel all over Asia Pacific with the team so he could personally hear from the customers and connect with them.  Ric also demonstrated a vast knowledge of the travel industry from both a sales and marketing perspective. He was excellent in creating PR opportunities and helped enhanced our company’s profile in the market. I have enjoyed knowing Ric as a friend and as a supervisor and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him to an organization seeking a strong and experienced professional."
