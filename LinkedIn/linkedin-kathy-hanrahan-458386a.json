Kathy worked with me as our interim CFO, as a consultant on my Retention Task Force, Enterprise PMO and finally as an Executive Coach. Kathy has been a tremendous asset to my organizations and LifeLock®. Kathy was a key consulting member of my Retention Task Force at LifeLock.   The theme of her composition is consistent: drawing the best out of people and identifying actionable business strategy out of financial results. She is highly capable of driving business results, doing detailed analysis, gleaning actionable solutions and presenting them in an articulate/compelling manner. She helped establish a strategy through Prado analysis combined with a cross functional systematic approach. The results are still being realized, while we have already had a tremendous impact on the bottom line.Kathy is adept at understanding others’ perspective; she convincingly pulls relevant personal experiences to eloquently influence change.  Her style is one of leveraging empowerment and encouragement to direct a symphony of performance results. She is a valuable asset to any team because of her talent of establishing solidarity among colleagues.  Kathy is very genuine and persuasive in her approach, a strategic thinker that anticipates obstacles during her planning allowing for smooth execution. Kathy’s competence, passion, interpersonal skills and integrity have enabled her to achieve what 1% of women achieve in a lifetime."
