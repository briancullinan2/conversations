Managing our sorority’s Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and website daily while updating them with the different events we have is the main part of my position. I also create some of our logos and graphics through Adobe programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop. This past year I was in charge of holding multiple photo shoots and creating our 2015 Pre-Recruitment video. Creating our Pre-Recruitment video included promoting it through different organizations, and launching it to the rest of the nation on a mass scale. Although it can be time consuming at some times, I am very organized in managing it with my time, and it is something I truly enjoy doing."

The determination Michael had to make our booth at Phoenix Pride 2016 run smoothly and efficiently was admirable, which shows that he is able to successfully plan out and execute anything he is presented with. I receive some independent work in my internship with Michael, such as designing flyers and other forms of visual communication to promote the Graduate Tempe. This freedom given to me shows that Michael is trusting of his coworkers, and believes both in the individual success of each team member and the overall success of the team. There has never been an instance where I have felt misinformed or confused on any project or event, and Michael’s strong leadership skills are highlighted every time.
