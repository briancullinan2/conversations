                "New food packaging made from seaweed is a solution to reduce plastic waste from the root. Instead of throwing out the single-use plastic, eat the wrapper made using Seaweed which is naturally high in fiber and vitamins. It is nutritious if it’s eaten, and if it ends up as litter, it naturally biodegrades. An area of ocean roughly the size of a baseball field can grow 40 tons of seaweed in a year, absorbing 20.7 tons of greenhouse gases. Unlike some other sources used to make bio-plastic–like corn–it’s grown without fertilizers, water, or other resources. Seaweed is treated for food safety and converted into packaging without the use of chemicals. With the growing awareness, understanding, and sense of urgency to minimize the use of single-use plastic, this is an interesting solution. Reference Evoware, Indonesia.

I have 10+ years of success in delivering  IT projects of all sizes - application and infrastructure - using agile or waterfall. My experience spans several industries (tech startups, healthcare, biotech, government, telecom) and disciplines (process improvement, compliance, governance, security).- I drive results by keeping the focus on the goal, scanning the landscape, adapting to change and removing obstacles- I provide the \"glue\" that unifies teams by having a positive outlook and strong communication skills – with all stakeholders, all levels- I am valued as a capable task manager, quick learner, thoughtful analyst, and advisor to senior management. My recent MBA program provided me with the opportunity to work with real businesses and non-profits on strategic, financial, operations and marketing plans - and thus to see how IT can help.\n  \n  \n",
