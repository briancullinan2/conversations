He's incredibly detailed and there's no situation he hasn't encountered over the years. Perhaps most important is his intense desire to stay ahead of the ever changing world of technology which means he's rarely surprised by what's going on in the industry.  Easy to work with and trustworthy make him someone I recommend without hesitation."
