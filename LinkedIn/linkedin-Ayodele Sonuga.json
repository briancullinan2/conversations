Ayo is a superb engineer, instructor and Matlab programmer.Ayodele received his BSEE in Spring 2012 from Northern Arizona University, and his MS in EE, also from NAU, in August 2014.I have known Ayodele for the last 5 years, as his instructor for 4 undergraduate courses (including Signals and Systems, Communication Systems and Error-Correcting Codes) and 3 graduate courses (including a Random Processes course and a course on compression, estimation and cryptography), his undergraduate research supervisor, and his masters thesis advisor.  Ayo is a quick learner and easily grasps abstract theoretical concepts.  He excels at both theory and lab work, as well as programming.Ayo is very good at explaining difficult concepts to students, and was one of our top lab teaching assistants (TAs) in EE.  He was a lab TA for NAU's freshman circuits lab course for several semesters, and did such an excellent job that the EE program hired Ayo to teach that course during the summer in 2013 and 2014.  He was a very good lab instructor, a natural teacher who was very responsive to student questions, and worked hard to improve his English skills to facilitate student understanding.  As a graduate student, Ayo was also a lab TA for the Digital Logic course and the Matlab programming labs in our Signals and Systems course for three years. I supervised Ayo in the Matlab labs, where he was an excellent lab TA, patient and helpful with the students.  His strong understanding of Matlab allowed Ayo to quickly determine where students were having difficulties and assist them in converting their knowledge of course concepts into code.  Ayo was always very well prepared for his labs, and very reliable; he would do the labs himself the week before to ensure that he understood them well and could identify potential problems the students might have with the lab.Ayo was an excellent researcher for his masters thesis work as well as earlier, as an undergraduate researcher.  His strong understanding of the theoretical aspects of his research, enthusiasm for research, and very good programming skills served him well in completing his masters thesis.  Ayo's successful thesis defense showcased his in-depth understanding of his thesis topic, and his skill at explaining abstract concepts through clarifying examples.I highly recommend Ayodele Sonuga as an electrical engineer, instructor orresearcher."

Ayo is a quick learner and easily grasps abstract theoretical concepts.  He excels at both theory and lab work, as well as programming.Ayo is very good at explaining difficult concepts to students, and was one of our top lab teaching assistants (TAs) in EE.  He was a lab TA for NAU's freshman circuits lab course for several semesters, and did such an excellent job that the EE program hired Ayo to teach that course during the summer in 2013 and 2014.  He was a very good lab instructor, a natural teacher who was very responsive to student questions, and worked hard to improve his English skills to facilitate student understanding.  As a graduate student, Ayo was also a lab TA for the Digital Logic course and the Matlab programming labs in our Signals and Systems course for three years. I supervised Ayo in the Matlab labs, where he was an excellent lab TA, patient and helpful with the students.  His strong understanding of Matlab allowed Ayo to quickly determine where students were having difficulties and assist them in converting their knowledge of course concepts into code.  Ayo was always very well prepared for his labs, and very reliable; he would do the labs himself the week before to ensure that he understood them well and could identify potential problems the students might have with the lab.Ayo was an excellent researcher for his masters thesis work as well as earlier, as an undergraduate researcher.  His strong understanding of the theoretical aspects of his research, enthusiasm for research, and very good programming skills served him well in completing his masters thesis.  Ayo's successful thesis defense showcased his in-depth understanding of his thesis topic, and his skill at explaining abstract concepts through clarifying examples.I highly recommend Ayodele Sonuga as an electrical engineer, instructor orresearcher."
