Michele worked with my staff to plan and deliver this 12 class program over the course of a school year and everything went very smoothly. The classes were held in our teaching kitchen at the Halle Heart Children's Museum in Tempe, AZ and Michele worked with our equipment and set up; in fact, she made suggestions to improve our kitchen and we've since implemented those ideas.This was a difficult program because it was grant funded and the food requirements had to meet or exceed the strict guidelines of the American Heart Association. Michele came up with several great ideas using our curriculum and eventually settled on a great flat bread recipe that was healthy and fun for the kids. She instinctively knew the students would love to get their hands in the dough and create their own flatbread designs with the vegetables available. The other aspect of this program that made it so complicated was that we had never done anything like this in the Phoenix market and we had no idea what equipment we needed to buy. Michele provided us with an extensive list of equipment and now our kitchen is fully prepared for future cooking classes. MIchele also was able to bring several of her students to each class to serve as assistants and that proved to be invaluable as managing 25-30 fifth graders was no easy task and definitely a job for more than one person.I wouldn't hesitate to hire Michele again as she is easy to work with, a great chef and nutritionist and a very detailed and organized person."
