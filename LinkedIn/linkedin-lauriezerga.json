Her topic was \"3 Proven Steps to Unleash Your Feminine Power and Envision Your Dreams\" and through her speaking expertise, approachable and charismatic presence and the power of her message she touched every woman in the room!  Her interactive exercises helped us to understand how much we actually do in life, hidden roles that demand time and energy. She shared how prioritizing what really has heart and meaning and regularly practicing self-care can shift the balance in our lives, enriching us all.  Laurie is an expert presenter and I highly recommend her."
