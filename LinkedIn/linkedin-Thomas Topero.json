        "summary": "    I am pursuing a certificate in Geographical Information Systems at the University of Colorado Denver. This education is expected and designed to tie together my educational, career and personal experience and skills in a meaningful and significant manner. The intention is to use this education to learn how to bring together disparate sources of data and make them useful to decision makers, and understandable by any interested party.My current employment as a Security Officer has been specifically chosen to aid in the support of my education while gaining significant exposure to many locations, organizations and industries in the Denver metropolitan region. This will be replaced by a professional track in GIS as I progress through the certificate program.Trained in architectural and urban design, with concentrations/focuses in sustainability and business have allowed me to understand and apply my skills at all scales and with people from all perspectives and backgrounds.Employment experience in allied fields of sales, financial services, construction management, project management, estimating and real estate, as well as running my own business and consulting service, lend additional understanding about the facets of the processes and end use of designed spaces and environments.In addition, sustainability is a core value that I live and demonstrate in all aspects of my life. I bring this passion and experience to the workplace and organizations in a way that expands the ideals of sustainability in an attainable and attractive manner.Thomas.Topero@gmail.com720.600.4680\n  \n  \n",
