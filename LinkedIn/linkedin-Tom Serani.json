I have been here since 2009 and just yesterday when I spoke to a entrepreneur friend of mine that has visited me at the office a time or two and he described cPanel, our company to me this way: \"Mario, when I tell people about what you do I tell them its like a high tech company with many smart people, and all the perks that I would imagine a company like google or facebook provides to its people. Its these standards in a company I would want my son to be a part of in the future\"  I can definitely say that cPanel, Inc. has set the standard having been part of some great companies during my career.
