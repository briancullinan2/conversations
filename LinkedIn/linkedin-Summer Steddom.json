        "summary": "    I am a systems architect with a strong emphasis in Identity and Access Management (IAM) coming from a background in full stack web development and enterprise systems administration. I have focused much of my career in management of next gen middleware and core identity services such as: Federated SSO, Metadirectory (Identity Repositories), LDAP, DNS, DHCP. I tend to see myself as a bit of a futurist in the IAM area and work to bring bleeding edge ideas to implementation.\n  \n  \n",
