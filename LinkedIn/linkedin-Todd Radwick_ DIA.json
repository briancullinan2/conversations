For those who depend on their earned income, it is more important than life insurance, retirement planning, investments or anything else."

                "After graduating from the Washington State Law Enforcement Academy, for about six years, I worked as a police officer and deputy sheriff in Washington State. During this time, I worked in both urban environments in south King County, Federal Way, as well as very rural environments in Okanogan County in north central Washington. I think of this period of my life as the time I did my tour of duty for society. During this time, in addition to my normal patrol duties, I also participated in a marijuana task force, and mountain rescue unit. I came to realize that while I was very much a people person and enjoyed helping them, I was more suited to the insurance and financial services profession and its associated successful clientele, rather than that which law enforcement deals with on a regular day to day basis."
