I believe I will make a name for myself one day. So where should I start I was in the grocery business for 10 years and I loved it! From there I went into solar sales and appointment setting. At the Stealth Solar,  I remained one of the top five  producers  my entire employment with the Stealth Solar company. Working my way  up to sales floor supervisor. Then I decided of many years of telemarketing that I would be my own boss and I started working the platforms and became very good at lead generation and now I am a lead generation  freelancer. I also just got done with Social Media classes and I'm trying to make a career  in Social Media. So as you can see I'm quite the Entrepreneur It's in my  bloodline.\n  \n  \n",
