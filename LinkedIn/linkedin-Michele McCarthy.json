Anyone who has been there knows what a joyful experience that is. But to create that experience with every project – well that was new.See, we had an edge. We used a platform called The Core, distilled by Michele and Jim McCarthy over hundreds of experiments with actual teams creating/building stuff.The Core enabled arbitrary groups of people to rally behind an idea (not the usual manipulative corporate mission stuff, I am talking about real people, really owning an idea), to harness conflict, to decide unanimously, and to make things happen. And sometimes (more often than you can imagine), create something great & lasting.Michele was a key in my learning and internalizing The Core in both my work and personal life (my kids love it). She is focused on results, is an excellent observer, and asks the one critical question that changes the flow of ideas, and helps me find the solution to a conundrum.Michele is a trusted advisor, and now a dear friend of our family. I would recommend her coaching to any organization creating brainware, and to anyone in a leadership role, without any reservations."

The help she needed was essentially support for how to deal with her extraordinary gifts and situation. She had, through her beautiful writing and engaging charisma quickly amassed a Facebook group of thousands. She was noodling over what to do next. (This was the surprising, exciting part for me). Since then we have spent many hours together talking about this and other projects and interests of hers. Venessa is a gifted writer and a builder of communities. She also is humble and carefully assesses her own personal growth on a daily basis. She is brave and willing to make changes in her life for the better.
