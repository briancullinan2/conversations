        "summary": "    I am naturally curious.  I am a dreamer, and a doer.  Those who dare to dream, along with walking the path of actualization of desire, get to live their dreams; creating their chosen reality.            I was raised by a journeyman carpenter who worked hard, worked smart and became to be known as a great builder of organizations.  My father with only two years of formal university, and all the tenacity he could muster, was arguably the first to apply the concept of building trusses in an assembly line process on a large scale.  He also was first to come up with a practical process to build pre hung doors and jambs.   In the 80's he was invited to assist in renovating the thoroughbred horse racing track by my grandmother's colleague in the Phoenix Millwork industry, Walter Clure.  Under his leadership, the industry of horse racing saw significant changes.  I was privileged to work for several years for Norman Freeman at EDCS.  He developed much of the technology that became EDCS while at Turf Paradise.  Later I was lucky enough to be involved in helping EDCS develop industrial automation solutions to real world problems in the areas of wastewater management, irrigation systems management, and admissions systems for municipal stadiums such as San Diego Padre's Jack Murphy Stadium and Del Mar Thorobred Park.  On both sides of my family, both maternal and paternal, invention and innovation has been something of a family tradition.  Problem solving is a key ability of mine, to be able to observe, understand a problem in depth and then come up with an efficient solution.    I have been very blessed to have been mentored by some very fine people who have helped me to find values and appreciation for innovation and excellence in the things I strive to achieve.  There is so much to learn in this journey of life.  So much to experience and share in.\n  \n  \n",
