        "summary": "    Upgrade Your Strategic Executive Skills and Attitudes to Realize Your Vision and Radically Increase Profits with the Executive Strategy Skills Summit in Denver, Jan 19-20, 2018.Specifically created for profit-and-loss-responsible executives of companies, operations, or divisions from $5 million to $100 million in revenue, this 2 day event brings executive skills and insights to founders and staff who occupy the executive suite. The exception: a P&L responsible exec may bring select team members they wish to groom for greater responsibility.In our market research, business consulting, and executive coaching work, we’ve learned that in small and mid-size businesses, most top execs have limited strategic skills. While they’ve been successful with their past work, they’ve never acquired the required strategic skills and holistic view of the business, so become secretly overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do.There are three basic skills gaps: Insufficient business acumen, no customer acquisition system, and undefined culture. In this event, we fix this.Key outcomes:* Develop your executive skill stack — what it is, how it’s radically different from a managerial skill stack, and how to intentionally develop it* A deep understanding of the Seven Business Pillars™: Product, Marketing, Sales, Service, Infrastructure, Finance, and Culture, which give you a holistic view of your business* Master critical executive business concepts that apply to B2B and B2C, for goods and services, for commercial, non-profit, and governmental operations* Develop your own Monday-ready phased plan to improve results and grow your companyWhat makes this executive event different is the holistic view of business, not just sales or marketing or leadership, but everything required to operate a sustainable, scalable, profitable, and salable business.Let's talk to see how this supports your goals: http://MarksSchedule.comMore at http://ExecutiveStrategySummit.com\n  \n  \n",
