A United Nations Delegate for Global Partners on behalf of OneMamahttp://onemama.org/onemama_videos.html#vidfavhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmNwLbQnX68&feature=youtu.beSummaryOneMama has developed a unique model for service - whose beneficiaries receive 100% of proceeds - that blends indigenous treatment with modern medicine and economic development creating self-sustaining communities within 5-10 years. Now in Yr 5, this project is specific to building the 3rd and final tier (the Community Center) of our OneMama Pilot Program so that its members and the community can become 100% self-sustainable by Yr 10.What is the issue, problem, or challenge?There are nearly 1.8 billion people in the world living under $1.25 per day because of poor economies & virtually no access to techniques, trades, education & the global marketplace. Learning how to achieve the dream for a brighter future is unheard of in communities where fighting for survival is the only outcome. OneMama seeks to eliminate these statistics by building 250 clinics around the world a starting with our pilot program in Uganda - which serves & empowers over 150 people per month!How will this project solve this problem?Your donation will directly benefit OneMama community members by providing birthing & medical supplies as well as training, materials & the development of their Community Center. We believe that in order to establish a self-sustaining community (just like any business), there must be nurturing & economic strategy. Now in Yr 5, we know that completing the Community Center will take Kirindi Village to 100% self-sustainability by Yr 10 - eliminating these poverty statistics one community at a time!Potential Long Term Impact"
