                "Anisha joined my team at Connexta over the summer as an intern. During this time, she quickly began to contribute in meaningful ways despite her relative inexperience with the tools and software we were using. One thing that quickly stood out about Anisha was her willingness to engage members of the team and ask questions with an earnest desire to learn. This sincerity coupled with her technical ability and friendly demeanor helped her fit in right away. By the time the summer was over we were disappointed to lose a teammate, not just an intern."
