Not just Big Data but ALL DATA. Right now anyone can scan or upload images into a computer, the end resultis an exact copy in image form, just like making a photocopy on a copier.Your system can not tell what information is displayed, who the author was,what the topic of the content is etc, minimal ability to filter, crop orcopy the information exists but that is it. IWR DRMS (Intelligent Word Recognition Data Redirection Management Systems)can. Artificially intelligent, not only can it read, but also to understandthe data it has read. It accurately translates into digital format eachaspect of this data, where it is searchable and populates the data into thelanguage used by the device calling for it.IWR DRMS has the following functions as part of its core: . Cognizant Recognition and Understanding of (so far) 72 languages . Handwriting Recognition. The ability to translate and display data. Convert handwriting into digital text. Recognition of image data, such as tables, elements, algorithms, etc. . Data converion into digital counterparts. Self Creation of Databases. Recognize Label and Replicate according to Author, User, Keynotes, Topicand Content by established protocols. Direct Data into one or more locations, systems platforms as indicated bythe user . Adapt to User Specific TerminologiesIt understand the context of data presented, learns from it, adapts, andinforms users when information indicate a mistake has been made.
