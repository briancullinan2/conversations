        "summary": "    Stephanie brings 20 years of hi-tech experience to the table and has held a variety of HR Leadership roles from start-ups to mid-size organizations.  She knows intimately the challenges faced by hi-tech companies and it’s leaders, managers and employees. Stephanie is also a trained Mind Body Stress Reduction educator and has been teaching for several years in medical settings, workplaces, weekly meditation groups and retreat settings across the country.  “It occurred to me after teaching in medical settings that I was teaching the people that I often work with.  Many of them were complaining of stress-related illnesses due to work.  So why were we waiting until people were getting sick to help them?  Let’s bring this to work and see what happens.” The programs originally created by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts have been adapted to fit the  workplace and the results have been remarkable.All of the programs that are offered statistically verified so there is no question that what is offered works for your company.   And there is a ton of neuroscience research to show why it works.\n  \n  \n",
