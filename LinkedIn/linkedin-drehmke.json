This tool would allow me to more easily match up what was marked as sold in our sales management program and the tags that came in from clients. * Built myself a simple task management system in Sharepoint. Included uploading files, added version management to the files with email notification on changes, auto-generated tasks when new files were added. Also had custom tasks for pre-checking landing page takeovers that included saving the links of the live DFP line items, the test DFP line items and the actual test links. * Nightly checked landing pages that had takeovers. Desktop, tablet and mobile versions. If there were issues, I would fix them. If I couldn't, I would contact my on-call person. Sent emails nightly at the end to indicate any issues or lack-thereof. * Sent emails each morning, coordinating with two teams in order to make sure the landing pages for that night were ready and noted in Basecamp. * Built a lot of my processes. This position had not existed at SheKnows prior to 2015."

        "summary": "    I like learning new things - new crafts, new technologies. I’ve taught myself HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and a little MySQL. I did have the opportunity to attend a programming boot-camp where I opted to learn Full-stack ASP.Net. During the boot-camp, I worked on a personal project for one of my role play groups - I got started building them a token / rewards shop so our players could get rewards for their various in-character achievements. Our group project was the start of site to build a community and support network for working mothers. We called it \"WoMoCo - Working Mothers Connection\". It was an interesting project and rather exciting. All six of us on the project had varying degrees of programming experience. I had fun not only trying out the new technologies, but helping my teammates troubleshoot and come up with new ways of looking at problems they were having.\n  \n  \n",
