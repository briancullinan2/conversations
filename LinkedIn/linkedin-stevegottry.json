        "summary": "    The Vision, and therefore the Purpose, of my small, agile company—Priority Multimedia Group, Inc.—is to \"Create, market, and distribute original content—in a variety of formats—that impacts individuals and organizations in positive, meaningful ways.\"Here are some of the things I've done, and am doing, to fulfill my vision and purpose:I am a published author, accomplished ghostwriter, and produced screenwriter. I wrote COMMON SENSE BUSINESS (HarperCollins) and co-authored (with Ken Blanchard) THE ON-TIME, ON-TARGET MANAGER (Wm. Morrow), and I have more books on the way, including 8 books with Mark Victor Hansen, \"Mr. Chicken Soup.\" Among my work-for-hire projects are 3 books by Michael Gerber, author of the E-Myth series, and THE BREAKTHROUGH, a parable by Gerard Long (published by Alpha USA).In November, 2010, my stage play, THE BITTER SEASON, was produced by  Imaginations Theatre, LLC. The 8 performances, with a talented cast supported by a great crew, were well-received. (The play is an adaptation of a screenplay about racism that I first developed in 1997.)As to screenwriting, even many of my friends do not realize that I wrote the screenplay for the most-watched children's movie/video of all time. (In fact, it's been dubbed into more than 146 languages.) I also wrote the adaptation of Max Lucado's bestseller, JACOB'S GIFT.I was named \"Writer in Residence\" at Grand Canyon University (gcu.edu) in 2004, where I taught \"English 498: Writing as a Career.\" I developed all of the course materials.I offer private coaching on writing and teach a one-day seminar on starting and growing a small business, titled THE BIG IDEA.Prior to its folding in mid-2006, I was a regular contributor to SUCCESS Magazine. (I am convinced I had nothing to do with its demise, and it has since come back under new ownership!)A good starting point to discover how I may be able to contribute to your future can be found at www.SteveGottry.com.My quote: \"I play on WINNING teams!\"Specialties: If you need a ghostwriter or an editor who can bring relevant new content to your book project, please contact me. My recent ghosting projects include THE E-MYTH INSURANCE STORE by Michael Gerber and John Rost (coming in 2013), THE MASTER PLAN, by Mike Ingram (Dust Jacket Press, 2012), and ANYONE, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME, by Rich Wllkerson (2013). Other projects include Michael Gerber's AWAKENING THE ENTREPRENEUR WITHIN (HarperCollins, March, 2008) and THE E-MYTH ENTERPRISE (HarperCollins, 2009).\n  \n  \n",
