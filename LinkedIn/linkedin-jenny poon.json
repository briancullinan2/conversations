As a boss, Jenny is a great motivator who constantly inspires her team to dream big and empowers them to produce great work. This coupled with the collaborative “yes environment” she has cultivated provides a powerful sense of space and freedom to experiment. To me, this is an ideal environment because it allows you to turn your ideas into action, even if it means failing (which she is flexible with as long as you learn something valuable, of course!)

We were so lucky to have found Kelsey. She came in, took charge and propelled us forward without fear. Very few times do you find an individual that has both the ability to dream and the ability to accomplish. She took our little business and doubled our numbers and brought new meaning to coworking culture. Kelsey has both strengths. She is an incredible partner and an incredible leader. Give her the end goal, get out of her way, and she will make it happen. I think beyond the ability to dream and actually implement, Kelsey has this incredible skill of empathy. This skill in the workplace is often lost when companies scale. I’m not sure how she does it. I think she somehow leaves her body and is able to inhabit another humans body to digest their thoughts and then return to her body to speak words and relate to others. It’s quite magical and is what truly makes her a leader above all others. She takes on overwhelming tasks with curiosity and when faced with unsurmountable odds is able to develop a strategy to find success. She’s organized huge events with more than 700 attendees, empowered young children to build startups and has been the glue to our community.

                "I had the opportunity to work with Kelsey during a growing stage of our company. We needed a person who could lead, have great vision and follow through. We were so lucky to have found Kelsey. She came in, took charge and propelled us forward without fear. Very few times do you find an individual that has both the ability to dream and the ability to accomplish. She took our little business and doubled our numbers and brought new meaning to coworking culture. Kelsey has both strengths. She is an incredible partner and an incredible leader. Give her the end goal, get out of her way, and she will make it happen. I think beyond the ability to dream and actually implement, Kelsey has this incredible skill of empathy. This skill in the workplace is often lost when companies scale. I’m not sure how she does it. I think she somehow leaves her body and is able to inhabit another humans body to digest their thoughts and then return to her body to speak words and relate to others. It’s quite magical and is what truly makes her a leader above all others. She takes on overwhelming tasks with curiosity and when faced with unsurmountable odds is able to develop a strategy to find success. She’s organized huge events with more than 700 attendees, empowered young children to build startups and has been the glue to our community. She is an asset to any team and a leader in any role she chooses to commit to."
