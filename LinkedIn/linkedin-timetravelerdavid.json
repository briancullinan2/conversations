        "summary": "    I'm a working writer, director, and actor. Rather than clutter this page up with a ton of stuff, this profile just focuses on my writing and directing. If you're interested in my acting experience, please check out my resume & headshots here:http://resumes.actorsaccess.com/davidmichaelsMy recent short film BEING THERE won \"Best Dramatic Film\" at the California Film Awards. I served as writer, director, and producer on it. I was very fortunate to attract an amazing team on this.I'm the kind of person who appreciates and empowers his team, inspiring them to bring out their very best work -- creating something outstanding together far greater than any of us could have ever done on our own. It's all about teamwork and matching up complementary skills and talents between the right people to create magical creative synergy. Ultimately, I want to take audiences on an emotional journey. Inspire their imaginations. Help them escape reality and discover new possibilities for their lives. Make them laugh, make them cry. Connect them to themselves and their loved ones. Make them feel good. That's the power of multimedia entertainment. And I'm so grateful to be able to do this. \n  \n  \n",
