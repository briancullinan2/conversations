        "summary": "    Since 2006, I have held diverse management and consulting roles with Bank of America focused on driving operational efficiency, revenue growth, client satisfaction, and on-time/budget project deliveries. These roles allowed me to serve as a trusted advisor and subject matter expert to all levels of the organization as well as a high-volume client base. Among my many achievements include saving $1M in potential losses, leading business turnaround, start-up and M&A initiatives, and volunteering on community outreach efforts. My specialties are operations management, process improvement, cost control, project management, staff management and change management, but I have equally strong skills in business development, sales, consulting and client relations. My financial services expertise includes mortgage, banking, real estate and underwriting.  A major factor in my career success has been my ability to embrace challenge and foster teamwork. I thrive in environments where I can truly add value and collaborate with hard-working and passionate people to achieve a common goal. I’m a loyal and responsible man from the Midwest, recognized for my integrity and taking commitments very seriously. In addition to my long tenure with one company, I’m married to my high school sweetheart and love spending time with our young daughter.I welcome all opportunities to connect with like-minded individuals at 619) 832-8640 or DMStew23@yahoo.com.\n  \n  \n",
