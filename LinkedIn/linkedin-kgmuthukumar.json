His highly dynamic personality with crystal clear focus and objectivity is highly sought by both, his superior as well as his business partners and subordinates. He is out-of-box thinker and due to this reason many project related issues just got resolved, by seeking out his guidance only. He sees a bigger picture opportunity than most people I've met, and breaks the task down so the short- and long-term objectives coexist and compliment each other. Finally, KG brings a sense of comraderie to the business which makes working with him doubly rewarding. He is a great professional and a leader who leads by example. His commitment and dedication are a source of inspiration to others. Strengths include high degree of customer focus, good understanding of business processes apart from technology expertise, providing guidance and encouragement to his team to think creatively and offer solutions that add value to customers.
