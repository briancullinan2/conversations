During that time, I was particularly impressed by Sean's ability to adapt and redirect the team's efforts in response to change.  This skill is not easily acquired; but it is so natural for Sean  - and his sense of humor and candor were things universally appreciated in tense meetings.  Sean is an adept leader and natural problem solver who has earned my highest recommendation.  He would be a true asset in any leadership position."
