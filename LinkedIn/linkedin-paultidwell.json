Software that exceeds the expectations of the business while being scalable, extensible, maintainable, traceable, secure, compliant and performant are hallmarks of winning software projects - and we deliver these continuously for dozens of clients a year.I have been a professional graphic designer and 3d animator, built high performance software solutions for securities trading, developed APIs, built killer software teams from scratch, and architected many solutions across a plethora of platforms and form factors.My goal is to continually improve as a leader, technical evangelist and strategist as I deliver products that exceed expectations while delivering on time and on budget and to work with talented and passionate people who share those values and goals.C#, C++, Java, Golang, Roku, JavaScript, and objective C are the languages of communication, aside from English. I love 12factor solutions deployed to containers and embrace automation.\n  \n  \n",
