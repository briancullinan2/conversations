        "summary": "    The world has complex problems and a lot of data. We can solve problems faster when aided by software and data visualized in meaningful ways. I do my part by writing great software, creating advanced visualizations, and implementing solutions in a user-centric manner.I thrive when writing tools that improve processes and workflows for organizations; helping transform the way analysts, researchers, executives, and everyone in between accomplish their work. To that end I am currently spending most of my time developing advanced web applications with compelling data visualizations written in D3.While I am a versatile developer that is comfortable wearing many hats, I am focused on growing into a leader and visualization expert. I avoid labels such as \"fullstack\"​ or \"frontend\" that pigeon hole my roles and instead favor open-ended titles and tackling the tasks at hand.I have written services; designed and implemented software build automation and verification systems; and defined software development processes and built accompanying tooling to support, encourage, as well as enforce process adherence. I prefer to be technology agnostic picking the best tool for the job though web clients have been my focus as of late.I am interested in human centric computing, data visualization, clean/green technologies, and cloud computing. The challenge of hard problems, agile teams, and cutting edge technology are my idea of a good time.In my personal time I have various projects including running Ubuntu-based OpenStack IaaS systems; Raspberry Pi controlled time-lapse photography machines; Arduinos and DIY electronics; home automation and IoT; and NHL Statistics.
