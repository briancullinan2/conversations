                "From our first contact, Matt made it abundantly clear that our relationship was going to symbiotic. He spent the time and asked me direct questions during the recruiting process to not only make sure I would be a good fit at Fairway, but also to ensure I would be able to reach my professional goals by being part of the organization. He really understood what I wanted to accomplish in the next stage of my career and was honest about whether or not I would be able to attain those goals by signing on. It was obvious that he cared about my happiness and professional growth which made the decision an easy one for me. 6 months into my role, Matt still takes the time to not only see how I am doing, but to make sure I am getting the experience that I signed on for. His continued concern demonstrates his genuineness and sincerity. His knowledge of recruiting is unsurpassed, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to a colleague."
