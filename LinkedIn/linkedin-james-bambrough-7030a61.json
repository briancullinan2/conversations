Our web group has delivered several applications that are highly visible to upper management including some executives in our Phoenix and New York locations.

I can always count on him to handle critical projects and tasks without much direction or involvement. It’s really nice to have a go-to guy on my team who I can delegate work to and trust that it will get handled with the proper care and attention as if I were tending to it myself. This quality is a luxury that I appreciate and it is extremely rare in my experience. His years of experience consistently shine through. That is quite obvious with his work over the months/years he has been at American Express. Jim is a rare animal in that he is proficient in all aspects of software development. He can dig in and do the development on any given project. He can put on his Project Management hat and do the analysis, offer timelines, and perform most aspects of the SDLC. He can establish a good working relationship with clients and business partners. He can lead others and rally the troops to produce results and hit milestones. He can relate to the most introverted engineers and work well with them. And, he can also switch gears and give a presentation to a Vice President. This type of person is extremely hard to come by. One other thing that makes Jim rare is his ability to work with various technology stacks. He’s not afraid to pick up new technologies when called upon. Jim is more of a “problem solver” than a computer programmer. He’s a true IT professional and I feel fortunate to have him on my team."
