                "A few years ago I had a gentlemen who was a store manager for me. One day, I visited his store and I learned that he had left. He was a superstar. Two weeks later I saw him in a restaurant. We started to chit chat and I ¬†found out the real reason that he left and it was VERY disappointing. He had left because his DM had given him a negative review. He also said that his DM had not visited his store in 5 months. Lastly, the fatal blow was when his son passed away, his DM asked him to return to work (for inventory) the day after the funeral. I went back to work on that Monday and started asking questions. Needless to say, I found out that this DM had been abusing his power. We terminated that DM that same week. I rehired that store manager as well. Eight months after we rehired the store manager, he was promoted to a DM and was number 1 for 3 years in a row. ¬†Here is what you can learn:",

The level of management Steve requires is minimal, and when he does need some help, he's usually already formulated the right approach.There were several instances I observed first hand where Steve built a relationship with a customer I didn't think would ever buy from us.  The same is true of prospects we had some engagement with previously, but lost the deal or project.  Steve actually snatched some victories from the jaw of defeat when no one gave him a shot at turning it around.I learned over the course of working with Steve to trust his sales intuition.  When Steve says something is going to progress, or that there is a risk to the deal, he was right almost every time.  When he was wrong, it was caution.

Things like training, marketing, lead generation and standard contract vehicles are all things we didn‚Äôt have and are arguably table stakes to being a successful seller.
