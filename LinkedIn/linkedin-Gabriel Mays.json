                "I'm excited to speak at the Tech Inclusion conference as part of a panel on veteran recruiting, moderated by Ian Faison. In preparation for the event, the organizers asked why I work on this area of Diversity & Inclusion. In short, it's because hiring veterans is great for business. Yet doing it well is both a huge and a solvable challenge. Together with our amazing tech partners and the veterans who give us a shot, BreakLine has proven that when talented folks have the right coaching, network, and access to opportunity, they can jump into a wide range of awesome roles and absolutely fly. That's terrific for veterans and their families, and even better for the companies that hire them. We have made a ton of progress succeeding at this within the tech industry, and we are expanding quickly to meet demand. Because every time a veteran is hired, we all win. #techinclusion",
