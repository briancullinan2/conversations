        "summary": "    Dan attended Santa Clara University in California as an English Literature major. He spent his junior year abroad at the University of Durham in England. While completing his Ph.D. in English Literature at the Claremont Graduate University, Dan taught at Harvey Mudd College, The Phoenix Institute at the University of Notre Dame, Mesa Community College, and coached basketball at Pomona College. In 1998, he returned to his hometown to teach humanities and coach at Tempe Preparatory Academy. In 1999, he was promoted from teacher to headmaster of Tempe Prep and oversaw the first six graduating classes of the Academy. In 2004, Dan authored the Great Hearts business plan, secured its initial grant funding, and was promoted to CEO of this charter management organization. In this role, he has grown the corporation’s central office and has overseen the founding of over 20 academies.  All graduates attend college; more importantly, their hearts and minds are shaped for noble leadership and a destiny beyond themselves. Dan is a 2008-2009 Piper Fellow and attended the Stanford University Executive Education Program. He is also a Pahara-Aspen Education Fellow (class of 2013). He is now working with the national board and executive staff on the founding of schools in Texas, with the first academy opened in San Antonio and more to be founded there and in Dallas/Ft. Worth. Other regions across the country are also being considered for future expansion. The purpose of Great Hearts is to restore American public schooling through a return to Classical, liberal arts education dedicated to the pursuit of Truth, Beauty, and Goodness.\n  \n  \n",
