It was inspiring to work for Jim because he is a creative writer, relationship manager, and innovator of his own.  He provides autonomy and advice when you need it, and then goes off and produces he own powerhouse materials for the team.  He's also phenomenal at finding the humor in any situation and his connections with others often pivot off a shared jest even in the toughest times.  He's the guy you want around -- and not just for the work."
