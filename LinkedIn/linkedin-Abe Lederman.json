        "summary": "    Abe Lederman has 35 years of experience in computer software engineering, the last 25 years focused exclusively on developing leading-edge information retrieval products and solutions. Mr. Lederman began his career as a Software Developer at Hewlett Packard and was recruited in 1987 to become a founding member of Verity, a startup pioneer in the field of text retrieval where he developed the user interface to their Topic product. Verity became one of the first companies to go public at the start of the Dot Com era.In 1994, Abe left Verity to start Innovative Web Applications (IWA), a software consulting firm primarily serving Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). At LANL Abe was one of the pioneers in developing web-based search-enabled applications including one of the largest applications at the time that searched 20 million records and contained more than 200 million hyperlinks.Starting in 1998 while consulting with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI), Abe developed Federated Search technology that enables searching of hundreds of information sources in parallel.In 2002, in order to exploit the full potential of Federated Search, Abe founded Deep Web Technologies (DWT). As President and CTO Abe has pushed DWT to set the gold standard for Federated Search, pushing the limits of what is possible. Innovations included: incremental display of search results, sophisticated relevance ranking, scalability to searching thousands of sources in parallel and multilingual search.Abe holds Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Computer Science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  \n  \n",
