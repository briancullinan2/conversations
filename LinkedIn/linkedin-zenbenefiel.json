A Possibilities Coagulator, I facilitate life-changing activities, craft curriculum, build websites, manage digital marketing campaigns, assist self-publishers, manage small to large events, produce presentations and more for my clients. Philosophy: Changing how we think is tantamount to changing results. 'Possibility Coagulation' means that in the process of creating action plans we crystallize the fluid feelings and thoughts into working plans with SMART goals.Bridging state-of-the-art business management and coaching practices encourage and inspire clients with reason for change and growth in career or professional opportunities. A primary goal is facilitating deliberate creating, making the work fun and insightful while providing value-added features that come naturally with the process.Goals are dreams with deadlines. Dreams present possibilities to attract and solidify resources for you. Deadlines and commitments realized are what drive success, including career changes. Relationships are built to sail the ocean of emotion, yet navigation with last century's mindset often yields disastrous results. We align your vision, mission, passion and purpose for maximum results.Companies using the principles of 'co-presencing' recognize the need for inspiration in their workforce and/or staff. A clear advantage: \"Do not hire Zen if you will settle for traditional guidance with no surprises. Don't hire Zen if you merely aim to fulfill some education requirement. You see, Zen is no ordinary consultant or facilitator. Do you have any idea how rare it is to find this kind of genius -- a distinguished guru who is a Gandhi-esque idealist and who also happens to have his feet firmly planted on the ground?\" - Jack Dermody, City of Phoenix, Four Colors, retired"

Zen was enthusiastic about the conference - his commitment to creating content that would transform people was apparent from day 1. He had a vision, and shared it with the committee members to create excitement and forge a cohesive team. He worked hard to make the event better than in years past, and was tireless in his effort to find exceptional speakers, vendors, and content. He was passionate about providing the attendees (our members) with valuable information that would change them, and make them better employees, better managers, and better people.

He has proved himself as an integral part of driving innovation and improving value to our membership. One of the qualities I admire most in Zen is that he goes the extra mile to assist and solve problems with his teammates. Put a challenge in front of him and he’ll approach it with unrelenting determination and enthusiasm to find effective solutions. He takes great pride in getting the job done and making meaningful contributions. Due to Zen’s strong work ethic, he works well independently and is an effective advocate for positive change.\"Quincy ConleyAssistant Professor at Boise State University"

Developed additional revenue sources with software training workshops. Created and managed annual conference 'The Shift - Challenge to Change: removing liabilities, limitations and excuses in the workplace.'\"I was fortunate to work with Zen on the committee that planned and produced the ASTD Valley of the Sun 2010 Conference. Zen was enthusiastic about the conference - his commitment to creating content that would transform people was apparent from day 1. He had a vision, and shared it with the committee members to create excitement and forge a cohesive team. He worked hard to make the event better than in years past, and was tireless in his effort to find exceptional speakers, vendors, and content. He was passionate about providing the attendees (our members) with valuable information that would change them, and make them better employees, better managers, and better people. Working with and for Zen was an exceptional experience, as he proved to be an inspiring leader.\"Brian HolmstenSr. Consultant, Web-Based Training at CVS Health\"Zen Benefiel has been a tremendous asset during his term as Website & Technology Director for the ASTD Valley of the Sun chapter.

                "I was pleased to attend the SCORE sponsored \"Build your business through LinkedIN\" class that Zen facilitated.  To say that the class was extremely helpful would be a gross understatement!  Every issue and topic (some of these discussions went beyond LinkedIN) addressed during our 4-hour session were modern-day applicable without being so very techy which made it quite possible for those non-techs of us to understand.  Additionally, the classroom  and real life practice of the nuances of LinkedIn were very helpful as Zen encouraged classmates to assist each other as well.
