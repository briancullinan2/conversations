        "summary": "    For over 20 years I’ve helped people resolve credit and IRS tax problems and have made it my life’s mission. I started during college developing a program for single mothers paralyzed in financial distress. I successfully negotiated with creditors and the IRS and witnessed first-hand the positive impact the results had on families and their peace of mind. Through experience with hundreds of people revealing their most personal financial secrets, I wrote and published a book, Credit Crisis, A Step-by-Step Survival Guide. The book addresses problems I repeatedly expressed and provides proven solutions. It is written in an easy-to-understand format for readers already overwhelmed. I sidelined consumer finance as full-time work during the Internet boom and joined the emerging field of user experience design (UX). I was privileged to work with amazing people, teams and projects during my years in UX. The work fit my need to figure things out and use common sense design to solve problems for users. While working in UX, I continued providing services part-time for credit and IRS tax problems. It became obvious that although I enjoy UX work, my heart is in making a difference at a personal level. Financial literacy impacts every person, family and generation. This heart tug focused me back to my mission: helping with creditor and IRS problems for financial peace of mind. The most urgent need seems to be with IRS help, so I dedicated my business to solving IRS problems. Frankly, some of the most common, costly and devastating mistakes are made by taxpayers representing themselves.Those who have worked with me get relief from their IRS problems and the daily stress they bring. A client’s peace of mind is my biggest reward and having such a positive impact on people, families and generations motivates me to do and be my best each day. I can help with your IRS tax problem and may be reached at (480) 502–9333.\n  \n  \n",
