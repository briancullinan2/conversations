Our goal is to create outstanding customer experiences, and be a company that’s personable, respectful, transparent, honest and helpful. Here are some specific goals with customers service: Offer you the best hearing aids at affordable prices Treat every customer as if they were a member of our own family To tell the truth. If we do not have a hearing aid that fits your hearing loss. We will tell you.Deliver your hearing aids within 5-7 business days--FREEIf you return your hearing aids, to issue 100% refund within 7 days of receiptTo provide the best customer service possible--if we screwed up--we will do everything in our power to make it right - we know the customers is not always right, but whether they are or not it is our job to make them feel that way.  Find and Keep customers and clients better than any of our competitors. Analyze our customers needs and offer better solutions than anyone else can.
