He showed up each day promptly and ready to work, not just on his own character, but with anything that he could find to pitch in with. Nothing was too much effort and he jumped into every scene and take, with conviction and intent. But he was also more than happy to quickly change course if the director deemed it necessary.I am fortunate to have had the opportunity do know Bill as an actor and now as a dear friend. His professionalism is only matched by his integrity and loyalty."
