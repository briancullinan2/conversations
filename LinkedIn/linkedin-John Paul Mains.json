We help garage startups, Fortune 100 companies and ministries take the guesswork out of marketing.  The idea of using customer data and analytics to understand how visitors engage with your brand has had a large impact for our customers. I've spent the last 20+ years as a digital marketing and technology leader for companies like Google, BMC Software and AT&T as well as small startups, including my own. I've lead the startup of new social media teams, lead generation, SEM and SEO teams, creative and agile programming teams.\n  \n  \n",
