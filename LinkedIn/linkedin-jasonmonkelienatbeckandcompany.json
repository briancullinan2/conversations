When Jason contacted me about a job that another recruiter had also contacted me about, I was impressed with Jason’s knowledge of the industry, he was honest and very personable. So from that first interaction, and with my gut, I contacted the first agency to advise that I would go with another agency in my job search and I went with Jason at Princeton Information because I believed in Jason.  Yeah, sure, all head-hunters should be personable, upbeat and have a gift for gab but it was different with Jason, he took a personal interest, he listened, he offered feedback and pointers for me to exceed not only with the contract assignment but on personal matters.  I appreciated Jason and he is not only a great representative with Princeton Information but he is a great person.  However, I was not expecting the perks that came with contracting with Princeton Information!  I have contract or worked as a temporary employee all of my life, in fact, every full-time job I have had were through an agency but never have I ever felt like I was secure with any agency as I did with Princeton Information.  The staff are top notched, knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  Upon walking into the Princeton Information’s office, you are greeted with smiles and you don’t feel like you are there to meet a quota. You actually have an orientation with Princeton Information to learn more about the company and the many benefits.  Did I mention benefits? Yes, from day one on your contract you start accruing a generous amount of vacation and sick leave, you are also paid all major holidays (no you don’t have to work 1000 hours to be eligible!), health, dental, vision and 401(K). Personally, for me, this was the very first agency that not only had a dedicated, personable, professional and knowledgeable staff but one that offered instant benefits.  Fortunately, I was hired full time from the contract that Princeton Information placed me on but it was a hard decision for me because unfortunately, I will not be contracting for Princeton Information, so yes, giving up my “freedom” was a bit hard because the staff at Princeton Information and Jason already made me feel like I was part of a team. I will miss my interaction with Jason at Princeton Information but I would recommend anyone to give Jason and Princeton Information a try if you are in the job market.

Yes, from day one on your contract you start accruing a generous amount of vacation and sick leave, you are also paid all major holidays (no you don’t have to work 1000 hours to be eligible!), health, dental, vision and 401(K). Personally, for me, this was the very first agency that not only had a dedicated, personable, professional and knowledgeable staff but one that offered instant benefits.  Fortunately, I was hired full time from the contract that Princeton Information placed me on but it was a hard decision for me because unfortunately, I will not be contracting for Princeton Information, so yes, giving up my “freedom” was a bit hard because the staff at Princeton Information and Jason already made me feel like I was part of a team. I will miss my interaction with Jason at Princeton Information but I would recommend anyone to give Jason and Princeton Information a try if you are in the job market.  Take it from me, Princeton Information stands out from the competitors, in a great way!"

                "Princeton Information was a rare gem that I would not have discovered had I not been contacted by Jason Monkelien. When Jason contacted me about a job that another recruiter had also contacted me about, I was impressed with Jason’s knowledge of the industry, he was honest and very personable. So from that first interaction, and with my gut, I contacted the first agency to advise that I would go with another agency in my job search and I went with Jason at Princeton Information because I believed in Jason.  Yeah, sure, all head-hunters should be personable, upbeat and have a gift for gab but it was different with Jason, he took a personal interest, he listened, he offered feedback and pointers for me to exceed not only with the contract assignment but on personal matters.  I appreciated Jason and he is not only a great representative with Princeton Information but he is a great person.  However, I was not expecting the perks that came with contracting with Princeton Information!  I have contract or worked as a temporary employee all of my life, in fact, every full-time job I have had were through an agency but never have I ever felt like I was secure with any agency as I did with Princeton Information.  The staff are top notched, knowledgeable, friendly and professional.  Upon walking into the Princeton Information’s office, you are greeted with smiles and you don’t feel like you are there to meet a quota. You actually have an orientation with Princeton Information to learn more about the company and the many benefits.  Did I mention benefits? Yes, from day one on your contract you start accruing a generous amount of vacation and sick leave, you are also paid all major holidays (no you don’t have to work 1000 hours to be eligible!), health, dental, vision and 401(K).
