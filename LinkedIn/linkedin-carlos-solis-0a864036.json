        "summary": "    Founder of media companies in North Carolina & New York. 2 newspapers and one magazine. Currently working corporate strategy and marketing assignments that include the vast multicultural markets, such as the Spanish language design and delivery of programs to reach consumers in the United States. Works completed include hotel, banking, health, transportation, education, communication and entertainment industries. Significantly increased revenues for global sales at MDhelicopters, Google, Inc., CitiGroup, NBC_Universal, American Express, Bank of America, America West Airlines, and Mercedes Benz. The list keeps growing and despite what some say about the high-cost of living in this part of the hemisphere, I am enjoying myself in the west coast. I graduated with a bachelors degree in international business at the University of North Carolina (Charlotte Campus) and also have an Aviation Management and Pilot program licensure at Guilford Tech, both in North Carolina. During my tenure at various boards, I have sat as a chair to the Consumer Credit Bureau of the Family Foundation in NC, The Business School, The Girls Scouts, The Red Cross and the United Way among others. Specialties: Sales, trainer and business development team lead. A consultant for language projects to include synchronized interpreting. Translated books, websites and marketing documents into Spanish. Responsible for product development, market and competitor research. Initiated investments, funding vs financing, vertical integration of products and services within industry specific markets. In my spare time if I am not playing soccer, tennis or on a photography assignment, I do acting for television and have helped produced a couple of major motion pictures with the 'Hollywood' types. I have been labeled a down-to-earth, humble, and hard-working individual with strong connections and a powerful approach to getting things done. Title I do not take lightly. www.carlos-solis.com\n  \n  \n",
