Sarah’s support not only to find solid candidates, but also make sure the process was like clockwork and the candidates had an experience worthy of our company was great. As hiring managers we try to describe what characteristics are important to us for the role (beyond “we just need that certain X-Factor!”), but Sarah really quickly worked out what we were looking for and I can honestly say there was not one candidate that I interviewed and wondered why they'd made it to that stage in the process. We spoke to many who may not have had the typical background, but we all agreed were absolute gems … before Sarah moved on to her next challenge she made sure that our mission was 100% completed. Nice work Sarah and thanks again for the hard work."
