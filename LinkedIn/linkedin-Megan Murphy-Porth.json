From a very young age, I was attending networking events, strategic planning meetings, and marketing seminars. My passion for helping businesses grow inspired me to go to law school, where I graduated with honors and created and supported a number of school organizations. I currently own my own business consulting firm in addition to being a practicing business law attorney.Prior to law school, I worked as the Business Manager for a software development company, the Deputy Director for a statewide initiative, and a lobbyist for the Arizona Department of Veterans Services. Additionally, I was the Chief Operations Officer of a web-based real estate training company, where I managed hundreds of clients and a full staff of employees.  When I'm not working, I love kayaking, camping, and granting wishes through the Make-A-Wish Foundation."

There is an \"heavenly\" energy that resonates within her and shines out to other people in her life like high beam headlights.  She is a true original, a stand out in a sea of others who just see the world as it is and conform to it.  Not Megan…she sees the world as it can be and she is going to make it so.  If you have the privilege of calling her your friend, as I so thankfully do, you should feel blessed to have such an angel in your life.  Megan…some days I felt as if you were the teacher and I was the student.  You are going to change the world, and I can't wait to see it.  Your friend and advocate for life, Greg."
