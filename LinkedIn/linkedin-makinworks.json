Pro Tools sessions and sound design experiments with ADR and sound design were also continued at the snail pace of a painter really not having the finishing funds or Sundance Festival to save me i realized i would discover myself better working in reality instead of waiting on a distributor or deal to finish the project for me. I worked on this until my father died and i felt no reason to continue. It was shelved for lack of funds and interest. Technology had simply not been available. Also the reality that the business of Hollywood was changing gave me direction to study other cases of success and failure before i continued any futher! Also being overwhelmed by DV, HD, and soon 4K it left me researching a new telecine or film scanning but building a scanner was impossible and not available lije it is today to build one and 3D print the parts! And Scan the film to the new 4K resolution. Out of no-budget vs charity vs extreme budget insanity left me realizing i needed to rethink the entire marketing plan of action and think outside the box! Pun intended! SD 4:3 resolution became an idea because of mobile phones and watching films on iphones and ipads. This technology spawned new life into the next decade making the reality of self-distribution very possible indeed!"
