As a small but growing start-up, a strong recruiting component was key to Homebell's success, and Jen definitely delivered strong results on the recruiting front. She was creative with her efforts, pulling from a variety of different recruiting pools and leveraging her strong network and industry expertise. She was able to get top talent into Homebell quickly and effectively throughout her entire time at Homebell, and I was impressed with how easily she could adjust her efforts depending on the role we needed fill. Jen filled a variety roles ranging from sales, customer service, upper management, and accounting.Beyond her recruiting efforts, Jen was instrumental in bringing Homebell to the next level and legitimizing us as a company from an HR perspective. She set up our on boarding process and put together an employee handbook that outlined all our company policies and procedures. She even saved us tens of thousands of dollars by switching us to a new payroll and benefits platform, an extremely difficult transition that Jen navigated adeptly and impressively.As I mentioned, though, Jen was much more than just a head of people. She was a true thought partner to the business and provided helpful suggestions for every department - sales, customer service, accounting, etc. In our leadership meetings, Jen always had suggestions and insights that greatly benefited all departments and the business as a whole.Jen's personal qualities also made her a great addition. Calm, a great listener, empathetic, and very intelligent. I cannot speak highly enough of Jen, and I greatly enjoyed working with her at Homebell."

As a small but growing start-up, a strong recruiting component was key to Homebell's success, and Jen definitely delivered strong results on the recruiting front. She was creative with her efforts, pulling from a variety of different recruiting pools and leveraging her strong network and industry expertise. She was able to get top talent into Homebell quickly and effectively throughout her entire time at Homebell, and I was impressed with how easily she could adjust her efforts depending on the role we needed fill. Jen filled a variety roles ranging from sales, customer service, upper management, and accounting.Beyond her recruiting efforts, Jen was instrumental in bringing Homebell to the next level and legitimizing us as a company from an HR perspective. She set up our on boarding process and put together an employee handbook that outlined all our company policies and procedures. She even saved us tens of thousands of dollars by switching us to a new payroll and benefits platform, an extremely difficult transition that Jen navigated adeptly and impressively.As I mentioned, though, Jen was much more than just a head of people. She was a true thought partner to the business and provided helpful suggestions for every department - sales, customer service, accounting, etc. In our leadership meetings, Jen always had suggestions and insights that greatly benefited all departments and the business as a whole.Jen's personal qualities also made her a great addition. Calm, a great listener, empathetic, and very intelligent. I cannot speak highly enough of Jen, and I greatly enjoyed working with her at Homebell."

Additionally, I've used that understanding to facilitate a better employee and recruiting experience for teams, candidates, and our partners. I have been able to engage with some of the top talent in software development, sales, marketing, customer success and client services with growing companies from start-ups to well-established, hyper-growth businesses.  Being able to participate as a strategic leader as well as having an active role in the execution of the action plan of several companies has been an amazing opportunity to learn from an incredible group of people while leveraging my experience to assist them in their successful navigation of various stages of the company's development. I have truly enjoyed the journey on which my career has taken me and each milestone has added a new level of depth to my understanding of and passion for people, growing businesses, and technology.  I hope to continue to connect teams by creating a vision, story, and shared experience around incredible cultures and organizational objectives.\n  \n  \n",
