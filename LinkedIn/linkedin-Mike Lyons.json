I never had to worry about things not getting done.  I didn't spend a lot of time correcting errors or reminding him to take care of things.  He wasn't shy to bring ideas that would make our radio stations or websites better, and more often than not, had a plan to implement them that was smoother and more efficient than anything I could have come up with.  Since Mike left us, there hasn't been a day where we haven't discovered something extra he covered that we didn't know about, and our productivity and organization hasn't even started to recover from the loss.  And yeah...I'd hire him again.  Without reservation, hesitation or passing go and collecting $200.  And I'd tell you the same thing if you called me, e-mailed me or hung out with me in a bar.So.

I never had to worry about things not getting done.  I didn't spend a lot of time correcting errors or reminding him to take care of things.  He wasn't shy to bring ideas that would make our radio stations or websites better, and more often than not, had a plan to implement them that was smoother and more efficient than anything I could have come up with.  Since Mike left us, there hasn't been a day where we haven't discovered something extra he covered that we didn't know about, and our productivity and organization hasn't even started to recover from the loss.  And yeah...I'd hire him again.  Without reservation, hesitation or passing go and collecting $200.  And I'd tell you the same thing if you called me, e-mailed me or hung out with me in a bar.So.  You should really hire Mike."
