In an extremely competitive real estate market, he secured a highly sought-after office space for Foursquare's headquarters, managed its expedited build out, and secured subtenants for 5 suites on an excess floor, all in under two months.  Nearly a year later, when a hurricane and super storm rendered the office and surrounding neighborhoods uninhabitable, Derek was able to secure working office space for the company's displaced employees overnight. Many other companies had to virtually shut down during this time, but his efforts allowed Foursquare to continue running as uninterrupted as possible. Though Derek and I were on opposite coasts, he was instrumental in facilitating communication and collaboration on projects.  In our time working together, we got two offices off the ground, migrated accounting systems, and maintained the company's finances, all while scaling operations from a team of 80 to 150.

                "Derek is a fantastic manager and colleague with whom I had the pleasure of working for just over two years at Foursquare. He has a creative approach to problem solving, a knack for prioritizing tasks and projects, and a managerial approach that encourages his reports to grow.  In an extremely competitive real estate market, he secured a highly sought-after office space for Foursquare's headquarters, managed its expedited build out, and secured subtenants for 5 suites on an excess floor, all in under two months.  Nearly a year later, when a hurricane and super storm rendered the office and surrounding neighborhoods uninhabitable, Derek was able to secure working office space for the company's displaced employees overnight. Many other companies had to virtually shut down during this time, but his efforts allowed Foursquare to continue running as uninterrupted as possible. Though Derek and I were on opposite coasts, he was instrumental in facilitating communication and collaboration on projects.  In our time working together, we got two offices off the ground, migrated accounting systems, and maintained the company's finances, all while scaling operations from a team of 80 to 150.  I haven't encountered another person in my professional career who could succeed in all of these arenas.I absolutely hope for the opportunity to with Derek again sometime in the future and believe he would be a great addition to any team."
