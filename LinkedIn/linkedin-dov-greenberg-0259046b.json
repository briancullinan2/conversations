He later taught me how to use those skills for reporting purposes to architect and design Powerpivot, SSRS, and Tableau reports. Jared takes pride and ownership in his work and always puts tremendous thought and care into his projects. He is not only technically strong but also goes above and beyond gathering requirements having a knack for anticipating business needs designing creative, scalable, and dynamic solutions. What sets Jared aside from many developers is his breadth of knowledge and deep understanding of fundamentals which makes him an asset on almost any IT project.
