On a car ride back, we once played a game in which we challenged each other to translate idioms from Spanish into English and vice versa. As any interpreter knows, this is one of the most challenging aspects of interpreting. Only one who has truly lived and submerded in the culture can manage to translate idioms. Rafael taught me some new ones, He understands interpreting because he translates thoughts, not isolated words, which results in accurate interpretations. I have absolute confidence that with his perseverance and natural talent in both languages, he will reach mastery in interpreting.\"Esperanza Clavell, Sworn Translator and Simultaneous Interpreter - +30 years active experience.(English-Spanish-Brazilian Portuguese, to and fro)"

On a car ride back, we once played a game in which we challenged each other to translate idioms from Spanish into English and vice versa. As any interpreter knows, this is one of the most challenging aspects of interpreting. Only one who has truly lived and submerded in the culture can manage to translate idioms. Rafael taught me some new ones, He understands interpreting because he translates thoughts, not isolated words, which results in accurate interpretations.

Esveide was very professional, had a great positive attitude, and I never felt alone through the hiring process. More importantly, she created results.
