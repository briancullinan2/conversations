She cares very much about what exactly the hiring manager is looking for, and helps the hiring manager refine their vision. Her candidate screening is very effective. In fact, I believe it took us one meeting to refine vision, and out of the hundreds of candidates she screened, there were zero clear misses. I never felt like I was wasting my time in an interview, because Josetta made sure very qualified candidates (both in skills and in team fit) sat across from me.She works well with new technologies, is prompt with her deliverables, and never drops the ball (and would never let me drop one either).
