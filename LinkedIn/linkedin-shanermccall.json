                "Scott is extremely talented in understanding how to bring your company's strategy and vision to life.  He has a unique combination of creativity, maturity, and business practicality that is refreshing in this day and age. He's a great listener, understands and accepts limitations around budget and/or timing, but still managed to deliver all projects on time. He has always provided clear, direct, honest and constructive feedback to us as clients, which in turn made the relationship more enjoyable and efficient. It's obvious that Scott's engine is powered by his passion for strategy and teamwork. His strategic insight dovetails excellently, positioning his team with exactly what they need to impress clients and meet their expectations. One thing I really enjoyed about Scott was that he knew how to make those around him have purpose beyond their titles. I feel very lucky to have worked with Scott and can only hope we interact professionally in the future once again."
