        "summary": "    Growing up I was perpetually fascinated by how good ideas matched up with good business could change the world around me.  I’m fueled by the idea that the world is something that’s created new again in every era—by a tiny few with the vision and courage to make it happen.  Individuals like Edison, Ford, Hopper and Berners-Lee have made the world I was born into very different from theirs. I’ve made it my life’s work to contribute what I can to building a new world for future generations as the titans of innovation and finance did for us. It’s an amazing feeling to create something from little or nothing.  But being able to take what you built and grow it with a great team is something else entirely.  Working at KKR for seven years gave me dozens of opportunities to do just that.  And while I worked with many companies in many industries, the technology and vision I was introduced to at GoDaddy stood out to me as an extraordinary opportunity to change the world.  I love getting up and coming to work each day because I believe each person can make a difference in the world's trajectory. This manifests in GoDaddy through a blend of technical brilliance, passion for our customers and scrappiness in how we approach our work. In that way, we’re a lot like our customers—those millions of people who run small businesses around the globe. Like them we started with a big idea (ours is to radically shift the global economy toward small business) and like them, we have a deep passion for our customers and approach our work with scrappiness and grit. Ben Franklin once said that without continual growth and progress, such words as improvement, achievement, and success have no meaning. At GoDaddy, we constantly seek to improve – both as individuals and as a company—and to deliver uncommon results for our customers and our investors.  If you share our quest for changing the world, and want to lend your passion and brilliance to the cause, we’re always hiring great minds.\n  \n  \n",
