Some of our best work is buried underground, driven over, or tucked away behind attractive landscaping. Some of our work features prominently along roads and highways. But all of our work is done with a \"Total Project Approach.\" At M·E, we know that solutions aren't solutions unless they take into account all the factors that impact the project, the owner, the users and the community. We measure success not by the completion of our work, but by the functionality of our work.Responsibilities include storm sewer design, pavement design, cost estimating, traffic analyses, project funding, and construction document creation."
