        "summary": "    My recruiting philosophy is simple: be kind, be attentive, foster long-term relationships and never stop learning. If you aren't taking steps forward, this industry will leave you behind.Inspired to push boundaries and grow in new ways, I joined Atlas Informatics to build an innovative, robust recruiting engine to grow our dynamic team and to redefine how companies search for talent.Previously, I worked for iMatch as a full-cycle recruiter and had the pleasure of guiding over 40 candidates successfully through the recruitment process, from initial sourcing and outreach to eventual placement at their new company.My goal is to continue connecting with exceptional people and growing as much as I can along the way, hopefully we have the chance to meet during this journey!\n  \n  \n",
