                "I am a full-time consultant and advisor to ambitious CEOs of growing companies. I work directly with founders, CEOs and business owners to overcome their biggest growth challenges. Most of my clients run businesses with revenues between $1 million and $10 million. Some run bigger or smaller businesses, but all these entrepreneurs are serious about creating big impact in the world.I understand what it's like to have a big vision and get stuck on the journey to achieving your growth goals. In these transitional growth phases, adding more tactics, more investment, more people, more intensity doesn't produce more results. Something deeper and more strategic is holding your business back. Behind the countless tactical challenges you face every day are the bigger, strategic questions that need to be solved for your business to keep growing. These aren’t the questions you can answer on the fly or delegate to your marketing department. Answering these foundational questions with clarity and confidence is worth millions to your business – in future revenues, higher company valuation, saved time and mistakes avoided.These challenges are figure-outable. They are just hard to tackle by yourself while you are running a  business. That's where I can help.Contact me directly and we'll have an open conversation about your challenges and if I'm a good fit to help you. Serious inquiries only.http://greghead.com/strategyI also speak nationally to groups of entrepreneurs and business owners, mentor Phoenix software entrepreneurs and I am working on my first book that I will launch later next year."

In all my marketing years in the high-tech industry, not only did I learn immensely under his stewardship, but also had a great time doing it.   It's not often that you see a start-up firm grow from a couple of people into a thriving business employing hundreds with products that became mainstream in just 2 short years.   Brilliant mind.  High Energy.   Enthusiasm that never stops.   A total go-getter that inspires all around him to drive toward single goal and vision.  The best ever boss anyone could ask for!"
