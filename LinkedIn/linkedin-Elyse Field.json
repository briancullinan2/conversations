Working with Elyse as interns for Northern Arizona Healthcare is something I will never forget. The passion, hard work and enthusiasm she put into each assignment is something that definitely elevated her above any other students I had worked with in the past. In addition to her enthusiasm and dedication to her position, Elyse greatly excelled at design work. It was always a pleasure to see the new designs Elyse would come up with for an array of design projects to include: fliers, banners, post cards, invitations & business cards. Each assignment that she finished dawned hospital walls, departments as well as local newspapers & were always a well known hit. Working with Elyse was a great pleasure and although our time together came to an end, I am confident that Elyse will excel in any area of the Communications & Design industries."

Working with Elyse as interns for Northern Arizona Healthcare is something I will never forget. The passion, hard work and enthusiasm she put into each assignment is something that definitely elevated her above any other students I had worked with in the past. In addition to her enthusiasm and dedication to her position, Elyse greatly excelled at design work. It was always a pleasure to see the new designs Elyse would come up with for an array of design projects to include: fliers, banners, post cards, invitations & business cards. Each assignment that she finished dawned hospital walls, departments as well as local newspapers & were always a well known hit. Working with Elyse was a great pleasure and although our time together came to an end, I am confident that Elyse will excel in any area of the Communications & Design industries."
