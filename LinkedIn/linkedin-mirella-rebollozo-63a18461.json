How? By exploring unconventional approaches and pairing technological innovation to develop a novel technology that can solve a variety of issues that were previously limiting the sound quality of digital audio. After thousands of hours of developing, listening and testing, a true breakthrough in digital audio processing emerged that far surpassed expectations and has the potential to change the industry once again. That technology is the award winning AfterMaster HD Audio (“AfterMaster”). ♦ As Chief Financial Officer of AfterMaster, Inc. I am proud that our technology is currently used by professional mastering engineers to master music for some of the worlds biggest artists, for online music mastering for independent artists and soon in consumer hardware products. Unlike other audio post production processes, AfterMaster preserves the original intention of an audio event and brings greater clarity, depth and amplitude to all of the audio elements without changing the integrity of the underlying recording.♦ Please feel free to contact me at mchavez@aftermaster.com, with any thoughts, comments, or questions about my work, or the work of my company, AfterMaster, Inc.--I’m always interested in making new professional acquaintances!
