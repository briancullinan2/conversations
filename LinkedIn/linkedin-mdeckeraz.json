Beyond all of his knowledge and expertise, he possesses an array of soft skills that naturally engage at just the right moment. He can challenge, build up, mentor and coach as necessary as though it's second nature.Last but not least - Michael has modeled personal integrity as only one other person in my life has. He does so on a daily basis. I can't emphasize how rare that is. I trust him absolutely - his expertise, his judgement, and his motives.What Michael means to the company:Michael is our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and is responsible for the management of TrendShift's research and development (R&D). He is the author of our product and technology roadmaps that capture the short- and long-term needs of the company, and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help us reach our objectives. He is passionate about system building and systems thinking, and creating solutions to problems or developing new opportunities.Because we are a small company, he also performs the role of CIO and CISO. In those roles, he has helped to navigate the regulatory obstacles to secure our applications, intellectual property, and our client's data. He was responsible for implementing the critical security controls for SANS20 as well as controls for Service Organization (SOC2) relevant to security, availability, processing integrity,  and confidentiality."
