        "summary": "    Quick preview of my resume. Originally from Colorado, obtained a 75% academic scholarship to Texas A&M where I also was a student athlete. Had two summer internships to further my business skills. One in Arizona, where I learned all the ins and outs of a small family owned company, the second one for Glazers a regional company. At Glazers I learned sales, supply chain and category management skills. Went on to graduate with a bachelors of science in Agricultural Business and a minor in Economics. Agri-business is a more specific business degree that studies the interrelations of companies interactions with each other as well as with economic influences around them. Currently work for Swiftpage as Lead Generation Supervisor. If any further questions, or in need of more in-depth answers please feel free to contact me.\n  \n  \n",
