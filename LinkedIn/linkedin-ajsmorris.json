                "The Transmashholding 4ES5K is the World's most powerful locomotive.  It has a power output of 13.12 MW and delivers a pulling force of 1,356kN during a standing start and then 928kN when travelling at its optimum speed of 49.9 km/h (31 mph).  By 2020 a total of between 50 and 70 are expected to be produced for Russian Railways (JSC) to operate on the Baikal–Amur Mainline (BAM).  The BAM is a key cargo link that runs for 4,324 km between Tayshet (Southern Siberia) across to the Pacific port of Sovetskaya Gavan.  This route crosses harsh and sparsely populated regions of central Russia, North of and parallel to the Trans-Siberian Railway.  The 4ES5K locomotives will be used to haul freight trains of between 6,000 and 9,000 tonnes on mountainous sections of the route in temperatures as low as -50°C (-58°F).",

                "The World's first operational supersonic fighter - the North American F100 Super Sabre. The F100 (also referred to as the \"Hun\"), was operated by the USAF between 1954 and 1971 and continued to be used by the Air National Guard until 1979.  A series of crashes in 1954 exposed design flaws that made the aircraft unstable in certain flight situations. The aircraft's stability was enhanced by modifications that lengthened the vertical stabilizer (fin) and extended the wings. Ultimately 2,294 F100s were built and it undertook 360,283 combat sorties in Vietnam.",
