All interested filmmakers and sound/media artists are encouraged to submit work for consideration.The DroneThe drone forms the basis of much world music, from Early Music to Ragas to American Primitive Folk Music to experimental music, the sonic drone places the viewer in a space that exists outside of time, inducing a transcendental state of consciousness and visions of ancient exotic landscapes infused with eastern philosophies. Or, anywhere the listener's imagination is liable to take them.On the surface Drone Cinema shares similar qualities with Slow Cinema, Structuralism & Minimalism, but Drone Cinema eschews narrative altogether and instead focuses on micro-movements within the frame: monotonal structures, monochromatic radiations, hypnotic ganzfelds, slowly changing blur fields, light beams filled with particles of dancing dust -- i.e., tiny visual nuances that go unnoticed by the casual observer. If you are a fan of Earth, La Monte Young, Tony Conrad, Phil Niblock, Terry Riley, Glenn Branca, Eliane Radigue, Indian Classical Music, Early Music or other drone music projects then it's obvious you know what drones sound like, but we want to know what you think drones look like.Looking forward to viewing your work,Kim Cascone Director/Curator, Drone Cinema Film Festival",

If amplified string instruments are provided then a fourchannel sound system (two speakers for the strings and two for my sine waves) will beneeded in order to achieve this effect.This effect will fill the the space with pulsating frequencies and acoustic moire patternswhile conjuring associations and visuals for the listener.The piece will be played in darkness for a meditating audience.* this piece can be adapted to either pipe organ or strings as noted in the text."

        "summary": "    Kim Cascone has a long history involving electronic music: he received his formal training in electronic music at the Berklee College of Music in the early 1970's, and in 1976 continued his studies with Dana McCurdy at the New School in New York City. In the 1980's, after moving to San Francisco and gaining experience as an audio technician, Cascone worked with David Lynch as Assistant Music Editor on both Twin Peaks and Wild at Heart. Cascone left the film industry in 1991 to concentrate on Silent Records, a label that he founded in 1986, transforming it into the U.S.'s premier electronic music label. At the height of Silent's success, he sold the company in early 1996 to pursue a career as a sound designer and went to work for Thomas Dolby's company Headspace as a sound designer and composer. After a two year stint at Headspace he worked for Staccato Systems as the Director of Content where he oversaw sound design using algorithmic synthesis for video games. Since 1984, Kim has released more than 50 albums of electronic music and has worked/performed with Merzbow, Keith Rowe, Tony Conrad, Scanner, John Tilbury, and Pauline Oliveros among others.Specialties: sound design, writing, performing, lecturing, & workshops\n  \n  \n",
