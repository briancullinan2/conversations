                "I have worked with Tami for several years at various recruiting firms, and she is undoubtedly the most personable, caring and supportive recruiter I have worked with.  She takes the time to understand exactly what you are looking for, and if you are not sure, she will help you to determine what would be the best fit for your experience and knowledge as well determining a suitable company culture for your lifestyle and personality.  She has the utmost integrity and is honest and objective with feedback.  I think most importantly, though, she is extremely encouraging and positive, yet realistic.  I truly enjoy working with Tami, and I know she has my best interest, as well as her clients’ best interests at heart.  Thank you for everything, Tami!  You are truly an amazing and talented recruiter, and I appreciate all you have done for me."
