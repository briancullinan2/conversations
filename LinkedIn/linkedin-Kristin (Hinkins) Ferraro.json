He assisted me (and many on the sales team) with technical questions for our High Volume clients, answered deliverability questions and provided deliverability consulting and was key in closing a few High Volume deals. He also worked with others on his team to serve as a liaison with many of our Technical Partners.  He did internal presentations on our integration partners and acted as a resource on providing more details on what various partners did, how they fit into SendGrid and how our customers could benefit from them.Rob is someone that people love to be around and work with everyday. He brings a lot of laughs and joy to those around him.  It was a pleasure to work with him and I would recommend him without reservation."
