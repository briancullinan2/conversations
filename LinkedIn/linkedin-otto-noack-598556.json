Changing jobs can be a complex and nervous process, but Troy's skill and professionalism made all the difference for me. To begin with, he immediately recognized that my credentials made me a potential good match for the job opportunity. Troy then became my advocate, and worked in a very focused way to get me the right exposure with the people who would be influential in hiring me. He also filled-in the blanks, explaining the organizational structure, key executives, the team's current priority objectives, and described the culture in great (and, as I learned later, in very accurate) detail. Meaning, I had all of the information I needed to make a confident decision. Troy seemingly worked around the clock; we spoke late in the evening, very early in the morning and on weekends. I was perfectly informed every step of the way. Anyone who has been through this process knows how critical it is to be aware and informed. 15 months later, Troy's skill at matchmaking has been validated - my recent promotion to Executive Director is evidence that it was a good fit all around.
