                "Empathy is the obvious resonance you could distinguish from speaking and meeting with Jill. She offers an abundance of positive energy, but most importantly she is patient and insightful. Through her patience, she is able to grow people the way gardeners are careful and patient with growing plants. Through her insight she is able to expand on her patience for those who are difficult, calm the nerves who are confused or upset, and dissect problems in process that stall the progress of others. She is consistent and clear with her instruction as she is charming and endearing with her leadership. Jill is the archetype in which I model my drive to advocate for the UX process and having integrity with all my future ventures as a professional."

She goes above and beyond in her research and makes sure that every feature and function in her projects is based on solid user research. She has no fear of contextual inquiry and will get out \"into the wild\" and observe people to understand their needs more clearly. She uncovers many solutions in her research processes that would often go unnoticed in a typical project. She is objective in her work and aware of any possible biases. Her journalism background and her gentle, attentive candor makes her a great interviewer of target demographics. She is a great collaborator and critical thinker and a true delight to work with.
