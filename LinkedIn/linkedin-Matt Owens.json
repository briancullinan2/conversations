I was the first hire in the Marketing Department and performed a lot of different functions for the company while I was there. I got travel the country and meet a ton of automotive dealers along with working with some great manufactures as well. It was a time of change in the automotive market place and Cobalt was on the bleeding edge. Lots of hard work and bold actions saw the company grow to over 450 staff members while I was there. Eventually I simply burned out and moved on but still have a very warm spot in my heart of Cobalt and all of the great people there. I learned how to manage growth and over come fear of failure while I was there and wouldn't trade the experience for the world."
