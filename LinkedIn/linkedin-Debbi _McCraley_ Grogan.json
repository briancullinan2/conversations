For 25 years, I’ve built strong relationships locally and throughout the state.  A vital part of my professional career has been staying involved with the community which has allowed me to work with most city government officials, past and present. This enhances my ability to comfortably fill this position and to immediately begin to work with people with whom I have associated, allowing me to continue working with entities on all levels.My belief in and commitment to the City of Flagstaff has only grown stronger over the years.  The combination of my business skills, vast community networks and passionate belief in Flagstaff’s future will give this organization the best possible means of success for making Flagstaff’s visions reality.\n  \n  \n",
