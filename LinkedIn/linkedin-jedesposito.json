I stretch to not only exceed stakeholder expectations, but to delight learners with content that is fun, beautiful and highly polished. I never build walls of text into PowerPoint presentations. Instead, I work backward to understand what learners need to be able to do after completing training so that my work will grab and hold their attention, and ultimately change their behavior. Best of all, I'm constantly given opportunity to expand and polish my skill set to create content with the latest tools and languages. There's no reason training shouldn't look gorgeous, elicit laughter, and meet the web's standards for user experience."

He was able to get a platformer game in the works in less than an afternoon.
