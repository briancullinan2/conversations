Students will use TwoWks’s mobile app (or website) once a week to track the progress toward specific goals (e.g. improve overall grades, get financial aid for college, increase personal happiness, etc.). Each time the students use the app to update their progress, they will also view a classmate’s progress and leave a positive comment – this ensures each student has consistent accountability. This whole process will only take 5 – 10 minutes per week. Throughout the school year the mobile app will take students through an interactive lesson plan that will increase parental involvement, instill solid habits, boost their motivation and transition them into post-secondary education. We incentivize students to get their parents, relatives and adult family friends to download TwoWks’s mobile app. This will allow supporting adults to receive detailed progress updates and participate in collaborative activities. A student with an engaged support system will benefit from the experience and knowledge of the group. “It takes a village to raise a child.”",

For your convenience, our website is laid out like an online store. Here is how it works: First we help your company come up with a 5 – 15 question survey. We specialize in surveys that deal with Customer Satisfaction, Customer Loyalty, Product Feedback, Market Research and Marketing Effectiveness. Once the questions are finalized, we create an SC-Page to house your survey. This is a diagram of an SC Page. SC is short for “Survey Collaboration” and an SC-Page is a collaborative marketing solution that allows a business to refer their past customers to other companies. The SC-Page can look like the other pages on your current website, or you can choose from one of our ready-made themes. After you do business with one of your customers, you can give them a flyer with a link (or QR Code) to your survey. Using surveys to engage your customers and stockpile feedback is invaluable. Although, the primary purpose of creating an SC-Page is the opportunity it gives you have customers referred to your business from other companies. The three advertisings slots on your SC-Page can be bartered with other companies who also have SC-Pages. The advertising slot sizes are; [a.] large, [b.] medium and [c.] small.",
