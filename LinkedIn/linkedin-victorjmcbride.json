                "Fire EmergenciesJust like their paid counterparts, volunteer firefighters respond to residential, business and other structural fires. They work to suppress the fire using a number of means, including laying water lines, putting up ladders, creating necessary ventilation and entering the property, if necessary. Volunteer firefighters report to their station's captain or company officer to receive instructions. Depending on the station, volunteer firefighters may drive the fire trucks to the scene or drive their own vehicles. Volunteer firefighters also operate different firefighting apparatus, including hoses, ladders, axes and saws.Emergency Medical ServicesVolunteer firefighters respond to other emergency situations, such as car accidents and natural disasters. Volunteer firefighters rescue victims and provide first aid, including CPR, mouth-to-mouth breathing and wound care. Because of the high level of first aid care required, all departments require firefighters to obtain EMS certification. When administering first aid, volunteer firefighters must attempt to speak to the victim or other witnesses to determine what happened. MaintenanceIn an all-volunteer fire departments, the firefighters are responsible for maintenance and care of the fire vehicles and equipment. Maintenance duties also extend to the fire station itself; common chores include mowing the grass, attending to the landscaping and cleaning. PhysicalBecause of the job's physical nature, volunteer firefighters must stay in good shape and pass a physical abilities test and medical examination before working. During a fire or emergency, a volunteer firefighter may have to knock down doors or walls, carry large pieces of debris or pick up victims and carry them to safety. Fighting fires often involves crawling through extremely hot, smoke-filled and hazardous conditions and volunteer firefighters must have the necessary lung capacity and physical strength."
