I have had the pleasure of working with Tobias for the past 10 months and I have nothing but amazing things to say about him. He is beyond talented in his work and always wanting to go above and beyond on any project. In his free time, he continually strives to grow in the digital field, finding new and innovative ways to develop. His expertise in both Front and Back End Development, along with his kindness and hard-working attitude, makes him the perfect developer. Whether a project is in discover, development or just needs a little help, Tobias is always the go-to person. I would strongly recommend Tobias without a doubt."
