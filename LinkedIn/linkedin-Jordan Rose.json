        "summary": "    Jordan Rose started Rose Law Group pc leasing space for just herself in another lawyer’s storage room and has grown the firm to the largest woman owned Law Firm in the western states. Jordan’s passion is adding value to her clients business propositions – her goal being “to make my clients more money”. The Phoenix Business Journal once asked Jordan what she enjoys most about the practice of law and she responded, “the ability to help people solve their problems.”In a profile by the Arizona Capitol Times, Arizona Corporation Commission Chairman, Gary Pierce, was asked about Jordan and responded “Nowadays, you turn around and say, ‘Oh Jordan’s doing that, and that, too. Jordan’s Firm is representing that group, and that group.’ And she got there because she works hard. She’s unafraid to do what it takes to ethically advocate the positions she’s been hired to take.” Of her ability to come up with creative solutions to complex problems, Constitutional Litigator, Clint Bolick, Director of the Goldwater Institute’s Sharf-Norton Center for Constitutional Litigation says “It’s very instinctive for her, and that’s unique. It’s not something they teach you in law school.”More....http://www.roselawgroup.com/biographies/jordan-r-rose.php\n  \n  \n",
