Primarily funded by the Las Virgenes Educational Foundation, combined with donated services, the process included hundreds of hours of interviews with teachers, staff, administrators, parents, students and community members. Unlike most reports the District receives, the goal and methodology of the project was to assist the District in creating a strategy, rather than just make recommendations.The result is a 198-page document giving the background, status, and strategy that is available for public viewing. The Board of Education held a Study Session on October 14th, 2009 to review the document. The 5 main points of the strategy are outlined in the executive summary.

He anticipated issues and problems, in most instances before they even arose, so that solutions were quickly implemented. He was a team player throughout the process and ALWAYS had the boys’ best interests as the focus of any decision he made. He was able to reach through to scouts who were having issues in such an effective manner that problems were solved, and the issues did not affect (or only had limited effect on) the rest of the scouts in the troop. Because of his extraordinary efforts and dedication, each of the scouts had a wonderful and safe time at the Jamboree, which was expressed time and again by the scouts and parents at our court of honor.  Without his efforts, I do not believe that would have been the case for Troop 831 and I would have had concerns about the welfare of the troop and the trip as a whole."
