We need to connect to make sure you have not already been submitted to some of my clients, to see if you are interested in these clients (project/location wise), etc. That is information that I submit to the client and that is the only way they get your information to then make a decision if they would like to interview you or not.\n\n>On September 19, 2015, 9:46 AM, Brian Cullinan wrote:\n>All of my resume information is available through my linked in profile.

I started in VB4 and explored .Net since it's inception. Later I honed my skills on the web with PHP and JavaScript. I enjoy all forms of software development and computer administration. In previous positions a 6 month salary review has worked well, as it gives us both a chance to show what we are made of, without breaking the bank. I have a lot of experience with start-ups, so I am no stranger to bringing new products and technologies to market in a controlled environment. I would enjoy a change to meet more of the team. For reference, I would be looking in the ballpark of $180k.

I wanted to reach out to you based on your current background and see if you were looking for any career opportunities at this time. If so, I have a couple of positions available that I think you could be a good fit for. If you are interested in speaking about them in more detail, please feel free to reach out.
