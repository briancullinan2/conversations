I considered myself fortunate when she agreed to join the Firm fulltime in the operational management role.Debbie is a dedicated and customer service oriented manager who effectively and consistently delivered high quality and on time service. I found Debbie to be extremely detail oriented, with a keen ability to not only thoroughly assess challenges but also present recommendations for addressing the situation at hand.   She is well respected and liked by her staff, peers, and management. Debbie is an asset to her team and organization."

        "summary": "    I am a full-stack .NET web developer dedicated to improving workflows and the understanding of data through the use of technology.  I specialize in C#, Web API, React, Angular, Javascript, ES6, TypeScript, Boostrap, Azure Table Services.  I will learn any technology that gets the job done, and sometimes \"just because\".  Right now I'm working towards certificates in Python and Data Science.You can reach me by messaging me through LinkedIn, or at dtwestwood@intechgration.com.From understanding what's in your documents, to who was communicating with whom at critical decision points in your business, to understanding how a poor night's sleep invariably leads to downing a pint of ice-cream, I have always been fascinated by retrieving and presenting data to \"tell the story\" so you can make better decisions for your business and your life.As a web developer, I want to understand what doesn't work with your workflow and use software to help smooth out those kinks.  I want to understand how data - whether for business or personal life - informs your decisions both big and small.  And I want to help you access what you need, when you need it, wherever you need it: on the road, at home or work, waiting in line at the grocery store.My own journey to this point has given me a deep understanding of how all of our decisions are affected by data; so getting the right data at the right time, and in the right format, is critical.  I have seen how the tyranny of \"we've always done it this way\" causes inefficiencies and missed opportunities.  I understand the importance of making software intuitive because the best app in the world means nothing if no-one uses it.What do you need from me today?\n  \n  \n",
