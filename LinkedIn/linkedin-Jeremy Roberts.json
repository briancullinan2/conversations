We are witnessing a world where people don’t write their resume—they live it. In essence, people write their resume little-by-little every day. It happens when they check into a location, have public conversations, share open source projects, post pictures, and more. Reaping the fruits of this enormous ecosystem requires intelligent learning software. This astronomical task cannot be solved with a singular job board, browser extension, ATS, or search engine. Developing real solutions means boldly breaking the archaic mold and proceeding with a novel philosophy. We aim to fundamentally change the way people are hired forever. Ultimately, we endeavor to solve hiring."

The SourceCon website was launched after the very first SourceCon conference in 2007 and has been a destination site for information, knowledge, and news for the sourcing community ever since. In the summer of 2009, SourceCon was purchased by ERE Media and the tradition continues. What is sourcing? In 2007, most sourcers created lists of candidates and recruiters made the phone calls. Today, the primary problem for most organizations has changed. Building lists has become easier but getting a candidate to answer their phone or respond to an email has become difficult. Because of this, we now define sourcing as identifying and engaging talent."
