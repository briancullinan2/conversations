                "Last week I celebrated 10 Years of working with John Adams¬†at The Score: Marketing, Production, Promotion. Although there were some breaks where I did not work regularly, it has been an incredible 10 years of growth and learning for me. John continually took chances on me - from hiring me initially as a high school senior, to inviting me to move with him to central California after graduation, to trusting me to run my own home office and continue working long-distance. My career path and overall path in life would never be where it is now if not for John and my time working for The Score; he was my gateway into the sports entertainment industry and for that, I owe him everything. He is a great boss, mentor, role-model, and friend.",
