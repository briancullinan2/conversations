I'm a Speaker who loves to share everything I know about organizational culture and customer service! I am part of the Zappos Family, and have been for 9 years! Before that, I worked all kinds of jobs - and I think that helped me to become the Culture Evangelist that I am today. Through my experiences playing music on stage, working as a corporate trainer and doing customer service, I found a love of speaking and sharing with a hope that I can be a part of a movement that helps change the world.I have spoken for organizations new and old, small to large, non-profit to big moneymakers, since all organizations have culture and purposes, the message has been well received! I had the honor of participating in TEDxLoyolaMarymountU in April of 2013! copy and paste link for video: http://youtu.be/NW5BGsmpYXoAs a musician, I have over 22 years of experience. I play Bass, Guitar, sing Lead and Harmony Vocals as well as Songwriting and have Live performance and recording experience. You can find my ramblings about the wild world of music on my website: http://www.missedthemessenger.comAs an Audio Tech, I worked with concert systems from small to large, as a soundman and A2 and have worked as a bench tech preparing equipment for shows, building customized racks and repairing cabling and equipment that was broken in the field.
