        "summary": "    APEA is a registered non-profit organisation working within communities around Mthatha to create grassroots and systemic support for children and youth. The aim of APEA is to build prosperous communities by creating safe, nurturing and enabling environments for children and youths to develop to the fullness of their potentials. We are writing to explore the possibility of partnering with Saint John’s College to implement the APEA Leading Light project around Mthatha. APEA was founded on the passionate belief that the most critical challenges faced by the African continent today can be addressed through coordinated grassroots initiatives genuinely concerned with transforming childhood experience. We have thus adopted an intergenerational approach to addressing fundamental problems related to abuse, crime, poor leadership, and poverty by directly involving children, youths, parents, families and the entire community. \n  \n  \n",
