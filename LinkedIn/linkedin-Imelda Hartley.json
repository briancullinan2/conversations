While I attended Amnesty International, I was able to send letters to governors, Presidents and diplomats al over the world to create awareness about the equal rights to trials and the violation of rights on prisoners worldwide. When modeling for the United Nations I was able to participate on real issues affecting the world and allowed me to create resolutions that will bring change. I represented Mexico and other countries. some of the topics i debated were Violence against women in the world; human trafficking; how to empower women in the new created democracy. I did a presentation about violence against women."
