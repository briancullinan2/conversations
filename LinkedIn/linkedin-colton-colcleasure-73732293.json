        "summary": "    Building web-based software is what I love. There's nothing else I'd rather do.I currently write complex React UIs all day every day, utilizing ES6+, Flow/TypeScript, Webpack, MobX, Redux, and so many other bleeding edge technologies.My main strength is in my understanding of core JavaScript. It enables me to pick up any new tools without a hitch. I feel that I am highly skilled for a developer of my experience and class, but acknowledge and embrace that I have a lot of learning to do, yet.I am also very fluent with Node. And, because I'm a hipster, I love writing functional JavaScript. :)I want to work on a team that is close, friendly, helpful, open-'minded and passionate. I seek an employer with \"culture\", somewhere that will allow me to be me, a human, rather than expecting me to be a suit with flawless etiquette.\n  \n  \n",
