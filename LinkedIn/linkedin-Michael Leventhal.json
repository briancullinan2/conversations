I am very impressed with his combination of technical marketing skills and creativity. Michael ranks among the few people who I would call \"concepts people\". He was given a daunting task when he came to Micron. I had the privilege of creating the early root architecture of a new processing concept:  the hardware which grew into the Micron Automata Processor, first hardware implementation of a Non-deterministic Finite Automata Processor. You can regard it as a symbolic processor rather than the Von Neumann / Harvard bit processors. Nothing existed. No software. No tools. No-one in the world understood any part of it outside of the small development team. And it was in stealth. Michael developed important collaborations with academic researchers which led to significant scientific results in genomics and cellular automata. He recognized the need for a different human interface to serve these markets and so he created the ANML (we pronounce it Animal, stands for Automata Network Markup Language) which is a graphic CAE design and simulation environment. You can think of it as the Automata Processor workbench, presenting a visual interface somewhat like MatLab is a visual interface for generic complex math problems. His contributions were felt throughout the project. I was particularly impressed with the approach to, and highly successful results of, the launch of the Automata Processor at SC13 in Denver, the world's premier conference on SuperComputers."

David was responsible for account management of the largest datacenter customers; my role was to create business conditions for success in those accounts. Our working relationship was always complementary and cooperative. Together we were able to increase Xilinx's footprint in a new, major business sector. I have to credit David with being one of the very first people at Xilinx to identify deep learning as a critical opportunity for Xilinx and to help initiate a company-wide focus on that area. He is very solid technically and quick to grasp the strategic significance of new markets. David is also very personable, readily builds confidence and trust with the customer, and is extremely diligent in tracking customer issues, building teams to address problems, and communicating effectively with all parties."

        "summary": "    Currently based in Bamako, Mali, I am an ex-Silicon Valley Techie growing a start-up NGO bringing practical education in STEM, entrepreneurial and innovation skills, programming and robotics to West Africa. In addition to tech-world proficiencies in engineering, marketing, business development and start-ups, my experience now includes executive management, international development, government relations, and education.My tech profile consists of entrepreneurial technical product management combined with high-leverage marketing strategy and engineering collaboration. Passion for launching new enterprises and new technologies, producing do-whatever-it-takes creative and successful solutions, often under challenging business conditions. Running an NGO in Mali, West Africa, makes great use of my experience in operating under challenging business conditions.In my last decade in Silicon Valley I specialized in hardware accelerators and massively parallel compute architectures and related software ecosystems. At Xilinx I led the effort to enable and promote the wide-scale utilization of FPGAs in hyperscale data centers as computing devices replacing CPUs and GPUs, especially in areas such as machine learning. Prior to that, for Micron, I led GTM as well as some R&D activities for the Automata Processor, focusing on HPC, bioinformatics and graph processing applications. Before Micron I was responsible for product management at LSI and Tarari (acquired by LSI) for FPGA and ASIC-based accelerators for networking, security, and data processing and related software stacks.Prior to moving into parallel compute architectures I was an internet entrepreneur, participating in the creation of XML and many of the core technologies around it, running my own company and partnering with several other start-ups in the U.S. and Europe.I’m a seasoned communicator, author of many blogs and technical papers, and a book, and am a  frequent speaker at conferences.\n  \n  \n",
