Rukmini was influential and had lined up early adoptors pilot groups and had enabled confidence in the offering of the new centralized testing service. The fundamental trust of the Technology leaders on Rukmini had helped reduce the natural resistence to new tool with top management's support, and the rollout plan. We sucessfully rolled out the test service to all Technology groups with 20+ concurrent projects.Rukmini is wonderful to work for. She is insightful and a very postive leader. She focuses on individual strengths and encourages growth in needed areas. Her authencity and transparency style brings out the best from her team. I am lucky to have worked for Rukmini, and has gained a mentor and a friend. I would love to work with Rukmini anytime."
