        "summary": "    Speak With A Geek (SWAG) brings together technical talent with leading employers. Launched in 1999 by a team of tech-loving geeks and developers, our passion lies in connecting the people who matter with the companies that appreciate them.  Social sites, job boards, and resume databases are noisy and overcrowded. These platforms continuously let job seekers and employers down. They barrage users with suggestions of irrelevant jobs or unqualified candidates. When piling on the additional challenge of looking for technical roles or talent, users are left frustrated and underserved. Cut through the noise with SWAG.  Our intuitive platform simplifies the job matching process, making it easier to find the right fit for you. For job seekers, that means having access to top-quality opportunities. For employers, that means finding diverse, fully vetted candidates with just a few clicks.\n  \n  \n",
