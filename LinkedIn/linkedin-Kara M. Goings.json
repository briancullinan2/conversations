        "summary": "    Hello, my name is Kara Goings and I am a recent graduate from Bentley University with a major in management, concentration in leadership and minor in law. Throughout my four years, I have worked in a Human Resource role where I exhibited leadership and communication skills by creating an employee handbook, working with and managing the calendars of 15 other staff members including the President of Bentley University.I have demonstrated teamwork and management skills by being a leader in various community service positions. I was able to multitask my three different jobs on campus while simultaneously participating in community service and extracurricular activities (basketball captain, CAB member, ALANA member, etc...) I am extremely interested in working as a Recruiter, but would love to continue to be an advocate of equality in under privileged communities. With a bachelor of science degree, I aspire to work in the Human Resources department within the sports industry as a recruiter. I would love to help new people assimilate into new job roles. I will always be active in the community in order to enhance my knowledge in all aspects.\n  \n  \n",
