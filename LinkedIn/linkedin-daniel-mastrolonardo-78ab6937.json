        "summary": "    Being able to celebrate Children's Hunger Fund's 25th Anniversary was nothing short of humbling and inspiring! Starting from a garage to having distributed well over 1 Billion dollars of resources, I am awestruck by the opportunities to deliver hope to those still in need around the world. I work alongside dedicated servants who are driven by our mission to deliver hope to suffering children by equipping local churches for gospel-centered mercy ministry. Together, we seek to equip those who have been uniquely called, with the things that their communities so urgently need. If you have been looking to engage your company or business in the fight against hunger, poverty and world relief, we would love to partner with you to serve these children and their families together. There is no greater reward than to bless others from the blessings we have received. \n  \n  \n",
