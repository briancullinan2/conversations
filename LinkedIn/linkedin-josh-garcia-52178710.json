                "I had the privilege of meeting Josh in the fall of 2007, when I began working with NAU's student news operation, NAZ Today. Of all the other students that worked in NAU Student Media, Josh stood out from day one. I am proud to have been a colleague of Josh's, and to call him a close friend. When I first met Josh, he was in charge of the student television station, UTV 62, which he essentially built from the ground up. His charisma and knowledge allowed him to attract and retain a dedicated staff that turned UTV into a real gem for the School of Communication. Shortly thereafter, Josh and I worked together on many projects and it was clear that our endeavors would be successful based on his hard work and dedication. These projects included promotional activities, video production, and a stint as elected student representatives to the faculty's Student Media Advisory Board, charged with converging NAU's print, television, and radio operations.When Josh transitioned into leading the sales effort for the entire Student Media Center, I knew he would be able to get the job done. His work in this position transitioned into a sales job immediately upon graduation in a top-15 market. I whole-heartedly recommend Josh for any position that he would apply for.  He is an asset that any operation would be lucky to have."
