First of all, she is an extremely talented designer and has done a great job of making even the most dry and boring content look good!  I have been so impressed with her skills that I asked her to design Arizona's Statewide IT Strategic Plan and she knocked it out of the park.  Natalie was also instrumental in designing the new AZ.gov and multiple state agency website themes.  She worked closely with our vendor to ensure the designs of the new sites were clean and fresh.  And finally, she oversaw the program in which a partner migrated more than 75 agencies to the new website themes.Natalie has an amazing attitude and demeanor.  No matter how tense a situation is, or how upset a customer may be, Natalie never loses her composure.  She is literally customer-centric to her core.  Natalie is always going above and beyond to help her customers, both internally and externally.  I can undoubtedly say that Natalie has been critical to the overall success of our organization and although she did not report directly to me, I would hire her in a heartbeat!"

                "I had the pleasure to work with Natalie over the past couple of years.  First of all, she is an extremely talented designer and has done a great job of making even the most dry and boring content look good!  I have been so impressed with her skills that I asked her to design Arizona's Statewide IT Strategic Plan and she knocked it out of the park.  Natalie was also instrumental in designing the new AZ.gov and multiple state agency website themes.  She worked closely with our vendor to ensure the designs of the new sites were clean and fresh.  And finally, she oversaw the program in which a partner migrated more than 75 agencies to the new website themes.Natalie has an amazing attitude and demeanor.  No matter how tense a situation is, or how upset a customer may be, Natalie never loses her composure.  She is literally customer-centric to her core.  Natalie is always going above and beyond to help her customers, both internally and externally.  I can undoubtedly say that Natalie has been critical to the overall success of our organization and although she did not report directly to me, I would hire her in a heartbeat!"
