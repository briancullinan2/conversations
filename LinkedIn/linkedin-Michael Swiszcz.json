                "Another day, another friend telling me that he can't find the talent. He's sitting on cash reserves and a pipeline full of business. But he can't find any good people to hire. Let's run it: (1) You need a mission and a vision. Companies need a strong culture. You don't get that by chanting slogans and doing team-building exercises. You get it through building that culture day-in and day-out. You lead by example. (2) Real talent costs real money. Pay up. (3) People want a future. People want to be part of a wining team. So win. And prove there's a bright future. (4) Check your footprint. If people look you up and really don't find much, your footprint isn't big enough. (5) Don't expect serious candidates to do a bunch of sample assignments and tests for free. That's scummy. You want people to spend time on tests and sample projects, pay them for their time. If you can't afford to do that, you're broke and shouldn't be hiring anyone. (6) Don't be inflexible. Don't say every candidate must meet these 50 criteria or they're out. BA or worse MA required?  No. Hire for talent, not degrees. What if a single dad needs to work 7am to 3pm instead of 9 to 5? Don't be stupid. Make exceptions for exceptional people. (7) Look in the mirror. Maybe you're a jerk and not a lovable jerk like me.",
