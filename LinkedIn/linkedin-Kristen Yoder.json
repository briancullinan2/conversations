But a wise person finds a smart person and learns from them how to avoid the mistake altogether”  Roy H. Williams Over the past 12 years, I have managed and/or set up the first dispensary in the City of LA (California Alternative Caregivers), 2 edible companies, one being an I502 compliant edible company in WA (Evergreen Herbal), the other being one of the largest edible companies in CA (Venice Cookie Company), as well a cannabis testing lab (The Werc Shop) with multiple locations on the west coast. In 2015, I moved into the ancillary side and began working with a renewable energy generator company(YOU-GEN) with a focus on bringing sustainable energy to cannabis cultivators. In 2016, I became partner at a management consulting company(LIV Advisors), and was also a co-host on the popular podcast, Cannabis Business Minds.I am the founder and CEO of Cannabis Industry Advisory Group. We specialize in advising entrepreneurs and investors looking to enter the CA cannabis industry. I'm also the current social chair for the Cannabis LAB Los Angeles, a national educational networking organization focused on bringing cannabis business owners together with Lawyers, Accountants and Business consultants, as they are essential to each other in the pursuit of attaining licensing!\n  \n  \n",
