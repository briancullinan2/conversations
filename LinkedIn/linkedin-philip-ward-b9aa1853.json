I perform research on new technology, tools, and industry trends to find ways to help the business achieve it's goals in the most efficient manner possible. I manage a couple different agile teams of developers; working closely with each team to ensure that the goals are met on time, and that the end results conform to the overarching architectural patterns and industry best practices. I work closely with the product owner, and stake holders to eliminate the communication gap between the commercial, product, and engineering sides of the business. Some of my areas of responsibility include the ECommerce website, the billing engine, our product entitlement service, our integrations layer, and I also recently worked heavily on the version 1.0 release of the Act!
