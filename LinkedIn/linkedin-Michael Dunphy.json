The method was developed 2002 in Germany and since 2010 we have been working on adapting the tutor to the English language. Finally in 2012 we were ready to offer our product to the public and we are currently offering the tutor for sale in our own web-shop at www.fightdyslexia.com and on Amazon.The project was and is great fun, teaching me a lot about business regulations and laws in America. Also the internet marketing strategy has taught me the differences between online marketing and print media marketing which I was overseeing for EUROKAT in Germany. The Reading Fox was and is a great learning experience for me which I enjoy greatly."

This was a very fun but challenging experience from which I have learned a lot about starting, building up and maintaining a small/medium sized business. From the beginning of our venture I was responsible for everything from developing a business plan, negotiating bank loans, overseeing the rules and regulations in the recycling business, overseeing the accounting process to fleet management and human resources. After the startup phase I was also involved in marketing and customer relations. I have traveled Europe for quite a while and have established great customer relations in that time. I left the company in 2008 to explore new ventures in the United States and to start a study in business at Arizona State University. I still hold an interest in Eurokat and today it is a very established company in the European converter recycling market."
