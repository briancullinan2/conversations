I have had the good fortune of riding the wave of a career as a speaker/entertainer that has spanned two decades, taken me all over the world, allowed me to touch the lives of millions of people and brought me over a dozen national awards for excellence.  The primary reason this all happened, is Christine Logan.  As my first agent, she helped to create, plan, form, mend and sustain my career.  She helped me create a brand that is, and has been known as the tops in its genre. Others could only marvel at the meteoric rise that I experienced and when people would ask me \"David, how is this all happening for you?\" I simply smiled and said, \"Christine.\"  She is diligent in her work ethic, personable by nature, and tenacious in her representation of her clients, but never loses track that she is working with people who have put their reputations in her hands.  As is probably quite evident by now, I highly recommend Christine to you.  In a profession that can sometimes get a bit \"sketchy\" it is nice to know that there is one person you can go to who will always take the high road. That person is Christine. She has learned that the view is better from there!  Hire her. Now.  You can thank me later!"
