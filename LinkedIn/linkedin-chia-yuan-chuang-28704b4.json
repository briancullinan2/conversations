        "summary": "    I worked at Coplex as a software developer and I am currently looking for a job at San Diego. I am PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science program at Arizona State University. During my Ph.D., I was supervised under Dr. John Femiani and co-chaired by Dr. Scotty Craig. I had one year teaching experience (Data Structure) and also worked on two research projects. The first project was a remote-sensing project, Digital Map Data Generation (DMDG) funded by Navy; the second was an interdisciplinary project, Global Dental Phenomics (GDP) funded by NSF. I helped develop DMDG API, which aimed to automate feature extraction of buildings and trees from aerial image. DMDG can help researchers generate a large scale of city 3D models without manually identifying buildings and trees. For GDP project, I developed a web platform, which can visualize and analyze high-dimensional 3D scans of teeth datasets. By using the platform, researchers can understand the interplay among genes, development and environment in determining an organism’s appearance.I am interested in multidisciplinary research in Cognitive Science with a focus on Computer Science in educational settings. My Ph.D. dissertation is “Improving Proctoring by Using Non-Verbal Cues During Remotely Administered Exams.”  In my dissertation, I conducted a lab-based experiment on cheating behaviors during online testing. It found that time delay, uncertainty, and head pose were significant cues for predicting cheating behaviors in test takers. Based on the findings of time delay and uncertainty, I published a paper on 37th Annual Cognitive Science Conference. I also published a journal paper at Higher Education Research & Development\n  \n  \n",
