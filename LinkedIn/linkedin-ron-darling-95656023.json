Serpent is available on Kindle and in paperback on Amazon.com and many other great book web sites.  Simply search for Serpent by Ron Darling. If you love Brad Thor, Vince Flynn, Clive Cussler, or any of the action adventure authors you might just like my little story.  Nick Washburn is the one they call \"That Guy\".  He solves the problems no one else can.  Terrorists at home and abroad fear his reach, and he always gets his man.  The Serpent, a Jihadist terrorist has planted bombs in all 48 continental States and is threatening to detonate them if his demands are not met.  Nick must locate and destroy the Serpent before he can act on his threat."

        "summary": "    When someone chooses to have a new custom home designed, be it a personal family home, a second vacation home, or a builder looking to create the most sellable spec home possible I have been specializing is exceeding my clients expectations since 1987 out of Scottsdale, AZ.  I have designed homes in seven western states and now I have expanded to doing homes all over the nation.  Projects in Montana, Texas and the Seattle area are upcoming as well as North Carolina when I am designing a great home on a river front lot.  My projects vary greatly, with budgets as low as $300,000.00 to homes valued at over $5 million dollars. No matter where you are, or where your new home project will be built, I'd love to discuss the possibility of working with you. If you are looking to have a home built and need a designer who really cares about your needs and wants, or if you are a builder looking to create that near perfect spec project that sells faster and for more profit, or even if you are a realtor with a client who has a home that needs to be redesigned on paper to help it sell...I can meet and exceed your expectations.Specialties: Custom home designerAddition designerRemodel designerConstruction documentsNovelist\n  \n  \n",
