The most famous of them, \"MMM\",  one of the World's largest Ponzi schemes of all time, made from 5 to 10 million people lost their savings (for many the loss included homes and other property). There were many other pyramids, so almost a half of Russian population were affected.",

They have to pay more money to buy bitcoins (their quantity is limited) and the cost of the latter goes up. Once media reach everyone reachable, new investors will stop coming, the growth will start slowing down. And then, everyone will try to sell, which will result in a massive bitcoin devaluation. That's how pyramids work.",
