The old lady took a free seat, and her man was standing next to her. None of the people stood up to give a sit to the old man to sit. From a distance I got up called him to give my seat to him.",
                "When I offered it, he smiled at me and said, \"Thank you, my girl, but it’s better you sit. I don’t leave my beloved one here for that far sit. I have to stay close to my wife because we have always stood by each other. I love her and I don’t want to lose her to sit far from her\"",
                "And smiling, he caressed her hair. I was touched by his words and the love to her wife. My eyes filled with tears.",
