He was able to relate to the staff, earning their respect and bringing out the best in them.  He was always well organized and professional and my branch staff would look forward to his visits.  Luis was well liked and respected by his colleagues at HSBC, and I would recommend Luis for any role entailing sales, management and motivation."
