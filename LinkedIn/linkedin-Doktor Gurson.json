Surveys rate it as a bigger problem than the next three issues combined. It’s the one feature that matters most (more than web access) – yet 80% of us charge our phones every single day, and a third of us 2+ times a day.Most of us don’t take our chargers everywhere we go – we find ourselves planning around charging, borrowing others’ chargers, and always running low. Even when we bring chargers, we’re constantly on the hunt for that elusive outlet.Enter Doblet. We’ve built a network of super-portable chargers that fully charges your phone in under an hour, wherever you happen to be. Whether you’re at your favorite bar, restaurant, coffee shop, hotel, on vacation at the beach, taking part in a startup conference, or even at the gym, we’ve got you covered. Just ask your bartender or concierge for a Doblet, plug it into your phone, and get back to doing what you do best."
