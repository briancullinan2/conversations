        "summary": "    22 year old living in Los Angeles, CA, playing Professional Baseball for the Atlanta Braves. I was born in Lexington, Kentucky and moved to Los Angeles when I was 9. This crazy journey inspired me to create the new animated comedy series located inside one of the toughest urban hood's around entitled \"Hub City\". My goal on and off the field has always been to make a positive impression on those around me. I have a great deal of passion for writing and being behind the scenes creating material for others to enjoy. Although my two passions are polar opposites, I feel as though dreams go as far as the mind allows them, but goals are achieved by taking a risk. I plan to bring animated comedy back to the communities of Urban America, and make an impact doing so. No matter wherever you are in the world or what your nationality is, we are ALL Hub City!\n  \n  \n",
