        "summary": "    I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and startup junkie. I'm logical and detail-oriented, so software development fits me pretty well. However, I also enjoy sharing my knowledge with others through teaching and mentoring.My company began with the goal of helping startups create their vision, but found that the Phoenix startup community was fragmented, at best. So, we began organizing events geared toward entrepreneurship (e.g., OpenCoffee Club, Startup Drinks and Startup Weekend) in order to draw out the nascent startup community.Since that time, the startup community has strengthened and I now concentrate on helping local startups create their vision, in addition to building products of my own.Specialties: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, web application development, API development.\n  \n  \n",
