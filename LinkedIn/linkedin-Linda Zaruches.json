        "summary": "    I am passionate about finding the right candidate for the right job. There is nothing more rewarding then seeing someone you hire thrive and grow in their career and reach their full potential.  I enjoy college recruiting and providing students the opportunity to start their journey towards an amazing career.   When I am not hard at work finding the perfect candidate, I get to sit in the Captains Chair on the set of Star Trek Continues. Or....I get to hang out with Chekov, yes Walter Koenig on the set of Star Trek Renegades. I am currently part of two separate Independent Star Trek Projects and enjoy spending time with Klingons, Vulcans, Andorians and even humans.   These are produced with an army of volunteers, crowd funded supporters and lots of Star Trek love.    If you haven't checked them out, below are the links to the YouTube page.
