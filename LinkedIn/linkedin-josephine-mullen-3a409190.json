                "Recently, thousands of Accenture people connected around the world, both physically and virtually, over a 24-hour period to celebrate the power of an idea. We shared examples of how our colleagues are turning their best ideas into innovations with impact to improve the way the world works and lives. I am always inspired by our people and what they can achieve when they bring their passions and whole selves to work. We learned about how Accenture has helped a client respond to the migration crisis in Europe. We heard about what inspires Accenture’s most prolific inventor, who is named on 140 Accenture patents and patent applications. We saw examples of how Accenture is applying “Tech4Good” (https://accntu.re/2pS0wl0) to address complex social issues. Our intent with this event was to reinforce how we are making innovation our mindset each and every day … and I personally came away even more convinced of the tremendous impact we can have in this world when we combine our collective imagination, creativity and diversity to drive innovation with purpose.",
