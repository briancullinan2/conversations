Erin was responsible for all operations.  She was key in facilitating a merger and several office moves.  She moved our company from zero policies and procedures to having formal, documented processes.  She was instrumental in driving the completion of an employee handbook, a robust interviewing and on boarding process, improved benefits and the launch of our 401k plan.  She remained a product expert and mentor for our consulting and implementation teams.  She was respected for her business acumen, professionalism and proven track record of solving problems.  She brought a great work ethic every day and a sense of humor at the right time.  As a manager, she was the ideal mix of supportive and directive.  She knew when to insert herself to provide guidance and direction and when delegate, trust and follow up.  Our customers loved her and the employees respected her.
