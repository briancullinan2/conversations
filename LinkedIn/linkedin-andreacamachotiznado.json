It requires long hours, is often operationally disorganized, and runs exceptionally lean.  Andrea faced each day with a “how can I help?” mindset.  During the course of the year I saw Andrea rise often in her role, and with the team. She contributed ideas not only from a creative direction but also around increasing efficiencies with processes and procedures and as an example, created a just-in-time training program for the team to help them evolve their creative and technical skills. Over the year her contributions continued to rise and she was promoted to Creative Director due to her unwavering professionalism with clients, approach to fostering an inclusive and trusting team environment and her eye for technical and creative detail.Beyond Andrea’s ability to create an amazing team environment, her creative approach and eye for technical detail is remarkable. Often times our clients would gush about her ability to bring their vision to life in such a special way. In fact we had close to a 95% client retention rate and attribute that to Andrea’s leadership of the team, her approach with the clients and the final deliverables that often exceeded expectations. From a budget and time perspective, she worked hand in hand with operations to ensure all projects were scoped to be on time and on budget.Overall Andrea is like no other creative professional I’ve worked with. She is honest, authentic, genuine, caring, attention oriented, detailed, technical and uber creative. I would not hesitate to work with Andrea again if given the chance!

We had the opportunity to work together in a fun and cool start-up called Videoloco and as we grew from a just another cool video production company to a solid digital marketing organization, Andrea was our rising star, our creative genius, and our lead storyteller!  She led a group of at least 4-7 other creatives and led them all to produce their best work!  Where ever Andrea goes she creates \"magic\" and I have the opportunity to continue that journey with her and to bring my best clients/relationships to create that custom magic to tell their unique and impressive stories!"
