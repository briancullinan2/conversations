Modify existing applications or create new ones to enable data handling and analysis.  Automate processes to eliminate repetitious tasks and/or increase efficiency.  Create UI’s for easier access by non-technical users. Selected projects:  Wrote a software package to  a) calculate statistical properties of large volumes of raster data b) allow non-programmers to calculate custom datasets c) enable batch processing with external scripts, resulting in significant time-savings. Investigated new avenues for visualizing landscape-level datasets  - Prototyped a Flex/Actionscript-based 2D display engine that dynamically reconfigures itself according to user-requested data, allowing users to compare and contrast the behavior of climate-based models across multiple time-scales.  Automated a variety of low-complexity computing tasks - eliminated manual copy and paste operations; allowed resetting of various visual attributes of raster/vector data in ArcMap projects containing hundreds of layers; updated shapefile attribute tables where the Field calculator did not offer the necessary functionality."
