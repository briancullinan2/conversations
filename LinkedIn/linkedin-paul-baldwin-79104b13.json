        "summary": "    Live audio is “easy” … until it isn’t. When everything goes right, production rolls without any bumps. When the situation changes or something goes wrong the importance of quality audio is obvious to everyone. The recipe for “good audio” is the right combination of equipment, skills and preparation.  Always invest the necessary time in organization and set-up, shortcuts or wishful thinking don’t get the job done. And it’s not just the technology. Working with the entire crew and talent to solve problems and get the best possible production is a fundamental part of capturing “good audio”. Helping the people being interviewed feel comfortable about the experience, besides wiring them for sound, also makes the shoot go smoother and the result better.I’m lucky to have a job that is always interesting. Every day I learn something new. I get to work with some fantastic people on some fascinating projects. The professional, passionate and caring people add to every experience. I especially enjoy  working when there is a “team attitude”, everyone willing to pitch in to do whatever is needed. If (when) something doesn’t go as planned on a project or a shoot, someone will come up with a fix and we’ll get the job done.Domestic Experience:  • CBS 60 Minutes (2 Emmys)  • CBS Sunday Mornings  • HBO Sports shows  • BBC documentaries  • NBC Dateline  • CBS 48Hr  • ESPN events  • Disney Channel Specials  • Major League Baseball Specials, including Spring Training.   • Super Bowls          (including last year’s behind-the-scenes special showing how a half-time show is created.)     • Over 100 celebrity interviewsInternational Experience:  • KGB special in Russia  • Ecuadorian jungle survival special  • Olympic Games – including Nagano  • National Geographic channel                    And much more …\n  \n  \n",
