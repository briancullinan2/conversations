If I were a hiring manager, I would certainly respect and highly value any recommendation Thach has for a potential candidate.  His ability to question candidates to determine not only their professional experience, but also their ability to socially \"fit\" into an organization is something you just can't teach,  I sincerely expect to see Thach write a NY Times best-selling human resources management book and/or become an innovative senior executive HR leader.

One was an entry level role and the other a leadership one. Thach surprised me pleasantly by not only proactively sharing candidates but also going the extra step of providing context and information which helped me as I repurposed those candidates for my groups. For the leadership roles that he and I worked on,  Thach helped me understand certain nuances of the recruiting which far surpasses his \"years of experience\". In my eyes, he is a true leader, someone I see managing a team not too far from now. He is a clear communicator, able to bridge many gaps and a fair person. He is just a wonderful person to have on your team and to interact with on a daily basis. I look forward to more opportunities of working with Thach now and in the future."
