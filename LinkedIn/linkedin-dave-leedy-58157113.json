Better to make mistakes than excuses, better to experiment and explore to find ways around your obstacles and overcome your hardships. Get some grit and go for the gusto. When you falter, when you fail, get back up, suck it up, spread your wings and fly again. Make a move, make waves, make your mark. Forge a brighter future out of the iron of your will.",
