But other recruiters won't necessarily share my viewpoint, and there's a good chance you could alienate 40% or more of them.¬† At a minimum, while you are seeking a job, and perhaps if you are looking to leverage your professional network in the long run, it's best to take your politics to another medium.¬† There are plenty of people on the internet who would love to debate you, who aren't your boss or future hiring manager. :)",
