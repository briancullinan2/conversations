I honestly can say that John Hall is not that person, for he has earned his stripes with grace and class.  John appreciates how when a company goes through battle together, it often come out stronger on the other side.  As a boss, he was in the trenches.  He never said no to going on trips or making calls together. He often edified his people publicly, making them feel as important as he was in meetings.  He is a solid organizational manager, a savvy strategist, and is a respected advisor within his industry.  Yet, the key reason for me why I recommend doing business with John Hall is how he acknowledges his people.  Always replying to every email sent him, always praising the person who closed a new contract whether big or small, and always supports his employees when they go through hard times (as his partner Zan does).  With John, you’ll not just get an advocate on your side, but a friend who remembers the little things."
