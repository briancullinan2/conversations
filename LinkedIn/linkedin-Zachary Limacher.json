                "I have worked with Tylor off and on for 12 years.  He is easily one of the most talented and most effective technologists I know.  He has \"director level\" skills in many disciplines.  He is much more a \"Renaissance Man\" (ala Leonardo da Vinci) than a generalist.I first met Tylor while he was a tool developer on a project to implement automated software deployment, and later worked very close with him when he was the Product Manager for the firm's IT Service Catalog - where we successfully partnered to roll out 200+ access services.  In 2011 we were lucky enough to score Tylor on our Identity & Access Management team, where he was tasked with leading many successful customer-focused solutions.Because of his depth of skills, Tylor is extremely versatile.  He is comfortable speaking to executives, driving program-level strategic planning, architecting solutions, managing products/vendors, eliciting requirements, or performing highly technical heads down work.  What makes him particularly effective at each of these tasks is that he relentlessly matches his work product/solutions to the needs of the business.  To say he is \"customer focused\" would be an understatement.Tylor is extremely security, audit, and compliance minded.  He anticipates the needs of regulators and will ALWAYS be the first person to both find vulnerabilities in systems and champion appropriate mitigation.  He meticulously matches solutions with standards/policies, and does an excellent job authoring any level of document.  As such, his skills are ideal for Identity & Access Management, Product Management, Program Development, Security Architecture, Risk & Compliance, IT Service Management, Management, or any number of disciplines. Tylor is a very competent follower when leadership is available, and steps right into any leadership void as necessary.  He seems equally comfortable taking a specific assigning or being thrust into a pile of grey - simply tasked with \"making things better\".Working with Tylor can be maddening.  Mainly because his points are always valid and he often sees/anticipates things before others.  As a result, my primary advice to working with Tylor is to listen to him.  In situations of turmoil I've never been steered wrong by relying on Tylor's suggestions or direction."
