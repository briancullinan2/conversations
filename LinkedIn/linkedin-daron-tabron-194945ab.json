Via YouTube where I am able to engage with YouTubians (the best viewers there are) and also through music. Entertainment is shifting and viewers have more control over what they watch, and truly desire to be involved in their content. If you wish to be apart of a community and be involved in the content you view, check out Diggs & Ghost, if you have an idea we will film it (within reason)\n  \n  \n",
