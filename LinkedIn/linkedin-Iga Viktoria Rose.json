Personal skin and beauty consultations, drafting treatments plans, answering multi line phone calls, managing payroll, scheduling, checking clients in and out,  calculating  employees and sales goals on daily and biweekly bases, running seasonal promotions, correspondence, billing and loyalty programs, and content for social networks and ads. Having a pleasure of working with well known celebrity \"hair whisperer\" Mr Enzo Armetta, and a team of cosmetologists, aestheticians, laser techs, and nails professionals who have been working  in the valley for over twenty years in the most prestigious salons and with intriguing and fascinating clients gave me an insight on how to stay successful and build a loyal clientele who loves visiting our Salon and Spa. Obtaining both European and American licensure trained me to follow the procedures safety and adjust to the highest sanitary standards. I am passionate about working in the beauty industry and enjoy learning. I am technology savvy and love implementing my knowledge to make the office run smoothly and have all clients pleased with the services we provide."
