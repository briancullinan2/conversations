This was patented on November 26, 2008 with myself as the lead inventor (see patent below).At this time the product was called Desktop Channel™ and a notable project was with Dell computer's Small and Medium Business division where small business owners would receive the application pre-installed and could then choose the business publication from magazine publishers from which they would like to receive content."

Soon after copy-cat products came to market, but mine has remained on the shelf for 24 years now.In addition to retail sales, I had a product that got the attention of physician's on a daily basis and sold custom versions to the advertising specialty industry, first for the pharmaceutical trade, then later other custom projects for large companies like Lowe's home improvement stores.I sold the publication rights to Andrews McMeel in 2003 and the product, and the genre of occupational humor, is still on the shelves and a strong seller today, more than two decades later."
