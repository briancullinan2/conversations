Rich is incredibaly driven, naturally charistmatic and truly inspiring. And the best part?  He has the results to match -- PatchLink's huge growth under his Sales leadership and Lumension's tremendous success in OEM Sales by his relatively modest yet extremely productive Business Development team.  He brings a ton of energy, a boat load of enthusithm, and a heart of gold wherever he goes. Most importantly, he brings in Revenue!  We might call him a \"Revenue Generator\" if we can put aside his colorful personality for a moment."
