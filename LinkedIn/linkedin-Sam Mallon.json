He has done an excellent job of building a strong, knowledgeable, and capable team under his direction. He has exceptional technical knowledge in a vast array of systems ranging from Windows, Active Directory and other Microsoft knowledge, to Oracle database management, to VMWare virtual infrastructure management, to security policy auditing and beyond. The breadth of his knowledge and the depth of his experience make him an incredible member of any technical team, and has great leadership skills to offer. I am happy to have had the opportunity to work alongside Bill and not only achieve great results, but to have also learned a lot."
