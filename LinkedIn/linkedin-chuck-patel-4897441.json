During my tenure at QlikTech, Champs Software became a strategic partner of mine and this was entirely due to Chuck Patel.  Together we were able to significantly increase Champs Software business intelligence revenue and place in the Top 10 for fiscal year 2011.  This accomplishment was a testament to Chuck's ability to create demand, follow up and propose a solution and gain the customers confidence.Look forward to working with Chuck in the future!"
