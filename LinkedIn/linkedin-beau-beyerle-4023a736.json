        "summary": "    With over 20 years experience, I have a very diverse background in video production. My work has been seen on every major network as both a shooter and producer, and featured on programs such as ABC's Nightline, CBS's 48 Hours and Sunday Morning as well as shows on Discovery, History, Velocity and numerous documentaries for clients like the BBC, CNN, NFL Network, ITN and PBS. Add to that an ever-growing network of commercial and corporate clients ranging from Scripps Howard, Microsoft, Arizona Super Bowl, Arizona State University and others, I have acquired the knowledge to tackle any project from a new, creative point of view. My work has won 11 regional Emmy Awards, having been nominated twice for the national awards and received the honor of 'Photographer of the Year\" from the National Press Photographers Association for the Western U.S. region.From ENG to film style production, I am comfortable with the entire spectrum of cameras available today. Staying on the cutting edge of camera technology by being the first owner/operator in Arizona of both the Sony F65 and prior to that the Sony PDW-700 XDCam is very important to me. With an extensive knowledge of both field and post production workflows, I am able to provide insight and expert support during the course of your entire project.\n  \n  \n",
