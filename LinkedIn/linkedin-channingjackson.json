Channing was dedicated to making the application work for the client and was an excellent co-worker within the project team. Channing worked well with all of the technical consultants and was a true knowledge leader for the team. He was also well respected by the client staff and was the primary liaison between the business users and the technical team. This project was in the early days of distributed computing client server technology and we were doing things that were new and innovative. The project would not have been a success without Channing’s hard work and dedication to the project and the needs of the client. I highly recommend the technical work he did at CSC, his dedication to the project team and ability to always stay focused on the needs of the client."
