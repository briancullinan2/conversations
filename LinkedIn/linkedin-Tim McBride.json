                "A career in #realestate for me is about purpose, impact, friendships and being a part of something bigger than myself.  As a former sports marketing professional and entrepreneur, I used the inspiration from one of my favorite quotes \"You Miss 100% of the Shots You Don't Take\" to honor this new chapter in my career by sitting open 100 homes by the end of 2017.  The campaign kicked off August 1, and today I’m in #McCormickRanch sitting open #home50of100.  As I reflect back on the first 50 #open houses, the consequences that have materialized in the process of committing to becoming consistent and trying to bring value each and everyday are RESULTS!  Only half way to my goal, I look forward to executing the second half of my #openhouse challenge by continuing to serve clients and the greater phoenix community with the same passion, determination, and purpose as the first 50.  #100OpenHomes #OpenHouseChallenge #wexlerrealtygroup #realtyexecutives #buyersagent #sellersagent #scottsdalerealestate #phoenixrealestate #azrealtor",
