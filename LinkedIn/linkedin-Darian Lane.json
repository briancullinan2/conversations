The name calling, the belittling, the horror, the 'this is not FB, this is LI' went on and on & I didn't even respond. I allowed people to draw their own conclusions. No one knew what I meant or cared they just sounded off, like they knew me.  A few asked me what I meant before going off, but they were drowned out by the angry ones. Why is everyone sooooo angry? Has Trump touched a nerve? What's going on? Nobody listens to anyone anymore. Nobody cares any more. Everyone is quick to get offended. Quick to jump to conclusions. Quick to judge.",
