For example, the \"offshore model\" has greatly impacted the ability for onshore resources to be placed in meaningful positions.  With his keen insight, strong business and technical acumen, he is focused and shares his thoughts on the matters at hand.  He introduced me to about one client per week and was generous with his time.  Within one month, I was given an offer to join a niche firm in the Financial Services sector.  This type of turnaround and opportunity is extremely rare!  I give all credit to Muhammad for the revitalization of my professional career."
