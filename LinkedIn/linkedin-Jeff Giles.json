It’s a five-year old software company that empowers content creators to do their most visual and imaginative work. Specifically, Ceros enables publishers and brands, from Vice and The Wall Street Journal to the Dallas Cowboys, to do extremely cool stuff — dynamic maps, deep data infographics, animation, video — without having to develop it themselves. We'll be creating a digital publication that explores and celebrates great visual storytelling wherever it’s found — in tech, fashion, sports, marketing, mass transit, space exploration and beyond. Stay tuned.",
