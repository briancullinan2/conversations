I'm also an active small business and creative coach. Most recently, I got the opportunity to work with inventors and entrepreneurs on Mark Burnett's new seed-funding show, Steve Harvey's Funderdome.At GoDaddy, I get to practice one of my passions: helping others take the creative leap and discover they had the power in them all along.Before my current role at GoDaddy, I worked as the Editor in Chief for our Small Business blog, The GoDaddy Garage.  Prior to that, I was the Director of Professional Development and Internal Communications. Check out the GoDaddy Garage (http://garage.godaddy.com) to see what we're up to."

        "summary": "    Hey there. I'm a Senior Communications Director at GoDaddy. These days I'm working on community relations, influencer marketing, and social engagement. GoDaddy is hyper-focused on helping people use the internet to take their ideas, their art, or their businesses from concept to reality. We're all about helping people create their future. In my current role I lead a group of people who team up with other thought-leaders to help would be small businesses, artists, non-profits, entrepreneurs and solopreneurs succeed. We do that through keynote presentations, videos, articles, workshops, and events around the world. We've managed social engagement during massive marketing campaigns. We've worked with million dollar budgets to develop high-performing content. We've spoken to thousands of people on stages around the globe. But our best work? Whenever we can sit down one-on-one with someone to help them take the next step.  And by the way, that does scale. Because, you know, people talk.Before my current role at GoDaddy, I worked as the Editor in Chief for our blog, The GoDaddy Garage. Prior to that, I was the Director of Professional Development and Internal Communications. And before GoDaddy, I worked as a writer and managed other publication departments.I love what I do. I've been a writer, a leader, a marketeer, and a performer for over 15 years. I'm blessed to do work that truly strengthens me. If I'm able to leverage these strengths to see others create something that didn't think they were capable of, I'll always find purpose in what I do. I have a BA in Writing from the University of Montana in Missoula, where there are more creative, poetic types per capita than anywhere else I've been on the planet.And hey, I'm always interested in hearing from former colleagues, friends, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect or catch up.\n  \n  \n",
