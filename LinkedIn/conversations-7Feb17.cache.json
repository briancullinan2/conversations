I'd rather they hire 10 other people to do my job. I am more interested in my own self development than in a company's. People don't understand the words I am saying to them when they talk to me. I have no evidence that people like working with me and there is a lot of apathy towards informing me on things that matter to them. I can't even say I have \"work\" friends because they never hang out with me outside at work. Most importantly, no one cares what I think. It's a battle between trying to be helpful and communicate my ideas towards a project and no one caring. Oh and I tend to minimize other people's problems like it's not big deal. Might be related to no one caring to talk to me.",

I would rather talk to you either in person or over the phone so I can get an idea of options? Some companies actually prefer they put their head down and work, other companies want that team factor. There is something out there for all of us, don't let the past issues get in the way of you finding somewhere you will love. My cousin actually works for Robert Half as well and he HATES people, it is so funny to me. He is in Technology and cannot stand when people talk to him. He is in the perfect department because they really do not have to deal with people very often...and let me tell you, my cousin is not good at acting like he cares about people. I love it though, cracks me up!",
