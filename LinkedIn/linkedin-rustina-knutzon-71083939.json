I transferred my negotiation and communication skills from IT staffing and banking into real estate in order to help my clients buy or sell homes with minimum stress and at the best price. My commitment to my client is to have constant communication. A real estate transaction can be difficult in any real estate environment, but I am great at coordinating the process as efficiently as possible."
