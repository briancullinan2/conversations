Ce site inspiré d'Airbnb propose une sélection de logements au design incroyable partout à travers le monde.Ce sont deux amis, Connie Lindor et Scott Muellner, eux mêmes architectes, qui sont à l'origine de ce nouveau concept de location.

Ils fournissent ainsi une description détaillée du bâtiment, de sa situation géographique.",
