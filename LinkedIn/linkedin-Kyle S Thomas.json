Our goal is to make sure we help simplify answers to some of the most basic questions about the startup life and entrepreneurial game.For a fun read check out this explanation about what we like to think \"42\" really means...The True Meaning of 42In ‘The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy’, a best-selling book and cult classic movie, the supercomputer ‘Deep Thought’ is built by a race of hyper-intelligent alien beings to determine the answer to “life, the universe, and everything.”Deep Thought, after 7.5 million years of computing and deliberation, determines that the answer is, somewhat anticlimactically, “42.” It sounds like a joke, but is the more to this answer? Douglas Adams was an unabashed computer nerd and knew a heck of a lot about programming languages and coding.In programming, an asterisk is commonly used to translate as ‘whatever you want it to be” - and in ASCII language, the most basic computer software, “42” is the designation for an asterisk. A computer, Deep Thought, was asked what the true meaning of life was and it answered as a computer would… “42” = “anything YOU want it to be.” - Pure Genius!"

He has great problem solving skills, and he has been one of the first to catch on to the mindset we try and create here at ViewPoint.

        "summary": "    I am a lover of the journey that comes with building and exploring amazing companies - Adora, a mobile charity app & ep42, where we create ELE's (Experiential Learning Environments) are both on my plate right now.I am also a farmers/ranchers grandson, general contractors son, a marketing scientist who turned in the serial entrepreneur I am today.Mine is a wild story. A journey that started in Texas, includes moments from coast to coast in the US of A and even across the seas to Asia. With all of the eye-opening experiences you could imagine one thing stands out - People - they are the only thing worth working for. Teaching, inspiring, leading, following, comforting, loving, caring, nurturing and the list could go on and on - these are the activities that fill my mind and heart.I love the marketing world, it was never just a job to me but a passion. I love helping people see what makes a product or company great, how to communicate about it and why someone should be a fanatic about this brand or that one. Adora is an amazing way to get the word out about the good that companies do and I am so excited to be part of telling those stories.Strengths: I love finding people smarter than myself then learning from them and what they do best. I've been blessed with a great gift for absorbing an immense amount of info in a very short time and holding on to most of what I learn. As a result I am your quint essential \"Jack of all Trades\" and a \"master of many\" in the making (youth comes with its drawbacks, to be great takes time). Hard work, vision, creativity, inspiration, marketing, sales, business development, and general strategic planning are all areas where I excel and continue to grow.\n  \n  \n",
