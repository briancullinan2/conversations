        "summary": "    I created a company called RESEARCH STRATEGY CONTENT because those are some of the things  I do really well: market and technology research, strategic branding and partnering, and telling a compelling story. My work is focused in the CleanTech, Clean Energy, Carbon Reduction, BioTech, Nutraceutical and Life Science industries. Tools may be digital, but the world is physical. I’m  interested in the real world.Recent projects include market analysis and investment disclosure in distributed power generation, comparative approaches to post-treatment borreliosis, study of extra-rational cognitive faculties in perception and problem solving, and review of technologies and markets for zero-GHG hydrogen and ammonia production. I have become a subject matter expert in hydrogen production and its conversion to ammonia (NH3) as the efficient hydrogen storage and transport medium. (See my overview on this topic at https://lnkd.in/gcvGJ-K)Prior to creating “RSC,” I was VP of Business Development at Clear Energy Systems, a development-stage mechanical engineering company engaged in modernizing and industrializing the Curtiss-Wright R1820 aircraft engine for distributed powergen applications. While the company’s commercial launch did not materialize, we enjoyed global attention through effective branding, messaging, media relations and editorial placement. On any given day, my phone would ring from any and every continent. I was previously engaged in a marketing capacity for two other tech ventures: one in mobile telecommunications software, the other in ergonomic data entry hardware; and I delivered coaching and leadership programs at the Consortium of Universities for International Studies while living in Europe.There are a few more bits to the story that space does not permit. Ultimately, my experience spans marketing, sales, leadership and organizational development in the arts, retail, real estate, banking and technology sectors.\n  \n  \n",
