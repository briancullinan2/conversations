        "summary": "    Full-stack, DevOps engineer experienced in technical leadership, architecture, and UX design.I have years of experience creating everything from delightful, snappy user experiences, to the secure REST services that support them, and the infrastructure automation that enables rapid iteration, high-availability, and confident, care-free deployment. I am experienced in everything from top-level technical architecture planning and design, to the daily implementation of frameworks and systems.My primary passion is for quickly creating solutions that solve problems for users in intuitive ways, and for creating engineering solutions at all levels for supporting the faster and more-stable production of those solutions.I have created Angular apps from scratch, migrated 15-year-old legacy code to a modern Single Page App architecture, designed and built IAM solutions authentication and service-wide AuthZ of millions of users, and converted dozens of microservices to run in Docker containers on Kubernetes, both on and off AWS.I've also designed courses and trained engineers and end-users on the use of these systems, maintaining documentation that is always up-to-date with the code. I've lead teams of engineers in defining and implementing best practices and conventions for increased code quality, as well as providing strong everyday technical leadership.I would love to hear how I might help your organization level up, both in job satisfaction and user satisfaction.GPG primary key fingerprint: 59EB EC86 C98D 5867 483F  31FB D409 317C 5B5A CD4D\n  \n  \n",
