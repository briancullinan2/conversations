                "I've had the great pleasure to work with Terry on-air at both her nationally syndicated talk show on Radio America - Think! America - and at her 550 KFYI Phoenix iHeart Media show. She is always prepared, organized, and effective at balancing the rigors of a time-sensitive production with communicating insight, knowledge, and warmth to her guests and listeners.As an experienced contributor to her shows, the quality I've come to appreciate especially is her instinct for designing the show. No one on talk radio brings together such diverse topics, which speaks to her experience and diligence at research. Every listener is going to connect with at least one of her selections, and there's always one genuinely surprising topic every hour that keeps me (and I'm sure her other listeners) on the edge of their seats closely engaged. Her talent for this reminds me of a skilled musical director who arranges a memorable concert program. An amateur might look at the selections and think, \"Why would she put these pieces together in this order?\" But then comes the show and you have to sit back in admiration afterwards as you realize, \"Wow...now *that* was interesting!\" She knows exactly what she's doing.Terry brings boundless energy, resourcefulness and dedication to her work. I'm always honored to be invited on her show and look forward to working with her as frequently as I can."

She is always prepared, organized, and effective at balancing the rigors of a time-sensitive production with communicating insight, knowledge, and warmth to her guests and listeners.As an experienced contributor to her shows, the quality I've come to appreciate especially is her instinct for designing the show. No one on talk radio brings together such diverse topics, which speaks to her experience and diligence at research. Every listener is going to connect with at least one of her selections, and there's always one genuinely surprising topic every hour that keeps me (and I'm sure her other listeners) on the edge of their seats closely engaged. Her talent for this reminds me of a skilled musical director who arranges a memorable concert program. An amateur might look at the selections and think, \"Why would she put these pieces together in this order?\" But then comes the show and you have to sit back in admiration afterwards as you realize, \"Wow...now *that* was interesting!\" She knows exactly what she's doing.Terry brings boundless energy, resourcefulness and dedication to her work. I'm always honored to be invited on her show and look forward to working with her as frequently as I can."
