        "summary": "    I'm a developer who's worked with web technologies across the full stack, from the basics like HTML/CSS to server-side code with C# and Node.js, to front-end scripting with JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout and ReactJS and also testing frameworks like Jasmine. I recently built a day planning app as part of a team of 4 using an SCRUM-based Agile Development workflow. I've also worked on dozens of smaller projects while picking up the above-mentioned technologies, from an E-Commerce store to a historical stock portfolio simulator.\n  \n  \n",
