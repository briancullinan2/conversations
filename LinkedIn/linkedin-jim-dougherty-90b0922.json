                "Jim Dougherty is one of a rare breed among entrepreneurs: he is one of the few leaders in ANY business whose disruptive vision becomes reality and causes major change in an industry. Jim's dream of creating a nationwide \"big box\" pet food and supply retail chain came true, and indeed it changed our industry forever.   But many in the independent pet specialty channel saw the rise of PetsMart as a great danger to their livelihoods. And it can't be denied that this new force in our industry caused disruption that hurt and even closed some small family businesses. But I have come to a contrarian conclusion: I believe that Jim Dougherty was instrumental in BUILDING both pet specialty retailing and natural pet food manufacturing into the huge businesses that we see today. How so? By having the passion, persistence, and vision to turn a few stores into the first national pet retail chain, Jim Dougherty jump-started the entire industry by luring pet-loving consumers away from supermarkets and mass retail stores. This exposed new consumers to better foods, treats, and accessories.    Smaller pet specialty retailers who wanted to survive and thrive in the \"PetsMart era\" were motivated to pioneer lesser known but nutritionally superior \"all natural\" pet foods. Independent retailers needed to compete with the big boxes and manufacturers filled the need by developing natural pet foods marketed exclusively to independent stores. These manufacturers trained retailers to sell healthy NUTRITION and superior outcomes instead of \"commodities.\" The once  tiny \"cult\" natural pet food business was thus propelled into mainstream consciousness.Today, the natural category is still the fastest growing in the pet industry. But independent pet retail stores need to beware and remember the need for INNOVATION and EDUCATION. PetsMart is stiff competition, but it's not really the big risk factor for today's independents. \"Natural\" marketing has become so widely used in pet food and treat branding that consumers now see it everywhere, including grocery, mass retail, and of course at internet \"stores.\"   To stay relevant,today's independents must research and select the best new products and be prepared to EXPLAIN WHY these products are better. This is sometimes referred to as product \"curation,\" and it makes the retailer a trusted destination for advice instead of just shelves and a cash register. Promoting heavily advertised and widely available \"all natural\" brands is a trap that favors big boxes and internet stores by making price the deciding factor.The best way to compete with PetsMart and other mass retail is by BEING smart! CURATE a selection of unique, healthy products and compete on YOUR terms instead of trying to be a warehouse. Thank you, Jim Dougherty, not only for growing the overall pet care business, but for helping improve animal health by contributing to the emergence of the natural animal care movement."

        "summary": "    I have always been a risk taker; a key factor in surviving as an entrepreneur. I have had the privilege of working with some of the most talented individuals in the pet industry. It has always been about the team and the ability to regroup and adapt to the situation at hand.I realized early in my life that pursuing my dreams would require, what I believe are four fundamental values; foresight, tenacity, integrity and passion.One of those core values is a favorite of mine...Passion.  It may be defined as a strong feeling of enthusiasm or excitement for something or about doing something.  My passion is the feeling of enthusiasm when I recognize the potential in individuals and encourage them to take it to the next level; to never settle for the status quo.  Helping someone discover their niche, having an impact on their personal development and professional success is indescribable.  Achievement – it should be a work in progress for all of us.\n  \n  \n",
