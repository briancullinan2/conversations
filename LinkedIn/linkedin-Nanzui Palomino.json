        "summary": "    I am a highly experienced in providing first-level innovation and user centered design counseling. I've developed and participated in projects for top companies, startups and brands of all industries.I have over 12 years of experience, with a diverse background specializing in multiple disciplines throughout my career such as design thinking, user research, user interface design (UI), user experience design(UX), branding, eCommerce, digital marketing (email mkt, SEO and SEM, advertising, social media, content mkt), usability and accesibility, management and team leadership. I am a highly strategic and conceptual thinker that love push creative boundaries. I love to manage the entire design process from user research and analysis and strategic planning, through design and construction and see the final product come to life in a way that delights our users while generating revenue for our business.I have a relentless desire for innovation, that I balance with business needs, and customer expectations.Through the years I have developed deep understanding of real world customer attitudes, needs and expectations – specifically relating to interaction through web and mobile.I have an interest and passion around managing and developing others in a flexible and adaptable way.I have a strong background in art, specifically in painting, music and photography. This has allowed me to approach design and management from a different perspective, it has also given me more sensitivity to understand the users needs.
