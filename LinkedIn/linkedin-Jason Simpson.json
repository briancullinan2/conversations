                "I was mute for the first 18 years of my life. Today, the condition is called Selective Mutism. Some of you may know what it is and a lot of you may not. It was not a brain abnormality or medical condition but was considered at one point to be along the lines of a form of autism. In the 70's, the doctors chalked it up to being shy. I gestured and signed when I was in school or in public. I spoke perfect English, but only within the four walls of the home. After many years of medical research and studies, it turns out it was based on being silenced and always told to \"be quiet\" and to keep my mouth shut. When I got the help that was needed, I had to learn to speak up for myself and learn that it was ok to use my voice.  I started speaking outside of the home for the first time in my first year of college when I met my best friend. I even learned ASL (American Sign Language) to aid the deaf who were non verbal.",
