I had training on the mechanics of PM but when it came to team building and people skills, PL Coaches had hit upon what I felt was extremely key to being a truly great project manager. First the term Credibility came up, followed by Relationships, Trust, Influence, and Accountability. I realized immediately that proficiency in these areas would make a huge difference in the overall success of the project as well as becoming the PM that team members and Stakeholders want to run their next project.
