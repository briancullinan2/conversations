Simply put, you cannot lock Steve down into a title or even category of job.  He is an outstanding developer capable of solving very complex problems in a fast and efficient manner that will leave you amazed. But he is much more than that. Steve can easily change perspectives and look at a problem through the eyes of the consumer - no easy feat in today's world of hyper-specialization.  He is a tireless advocate for the customer and spends a lot of time thinking about how to meet both the needs of the business and the customer. In my career I have come across very few people that have the breadth and depth of skills that Steve does. Calculating his value is impossible. He would be the first pick for any team I was putting together."
