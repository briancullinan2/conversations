                "Polished, meticulous, and driven are just a few of the qualities that come to mind when I think about Zach.    As an Account Executive at SAP/Ariba, I worked closely with Zach, who supported me as a Solution Consultant,  on many client engagements.    As any successful Account Executive will attest, having a truly talented Solution Consultant supporting you in the field  can make all the difference.    Fortunately, for me, Zach was one of those talented Solution Consultants.   Above all,  I was impressed by Zach’s  innate ability to  quickly connect  and establish rapport with customers.  Not only  on a  professional level, but a personal level as well.   Zach is a true asset in the field and comes with my highest recommendation."

Zach brought a sense of passion and energy to the job that was contagious.

I expect Zach to have a stellar presales career at SAP.
