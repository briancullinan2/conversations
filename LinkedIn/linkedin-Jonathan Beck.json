Deborah was always willing to go above and beyond to make sure the buying/sales process went as smoothly as possible. She was willing to work after hours to ensure all the necessary documents and forms were correctly filled out, and that we didn't miss any deadlines. Deborah provided clear descriptions for any questions we had during the sales process. In every one of our interactions, Deborah always acted with patience, care, knowledge, and professionalism.
