I hired Stella into the Capgemini Change Management team in July 2012 where she worked for eighteen months successfully building great relationships with her colleagues and with Customers who provided multiple instances of positive feedback related to her customer focus and service-oriented nature. Stella was always willing to go the extra mile to meet and exceed Customer expectations. A popular and enthusiastic member of the Change Management team, Stella was a primary contributor to maintaining the high levels of morale in the team and making the team’s working environment as positive as possible. Stella consistently demonstrated a high degree of technical acumen and an understanding of and adoption of Change Management best practices ensuring at all times that the work of the Agencies she supported was enabled while ensuring minimal risks to the IT Operational environment. It was a great pleasure to know and work with Stella for that period of time and I have no hesitation in providing this testimonial. Good luck with all your future endeavors Stella."
