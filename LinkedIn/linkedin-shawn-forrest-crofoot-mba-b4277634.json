                "I’m very pleased to have joined Alliance Home Loans and bring my years of experience in the Mortgage Industry. I spent first few years of my career as a loan officer assistant and in operations learning how to originate and produce loans that work. I pride myself on my communication skills, and believe that communication and preparation are the keys to a smooth and stress free transaction. I work hard to provide a thorough and complete pre-qualification for every client, I believe that a pre-qualification form should be a blank check and not a question mark. I make myself available to my clients and realtor partners seven days a week, including evenings, because I understand that life can happen and 9am-5pm just isn't as convenient as we wish it could be. Outside of work I am a former classically trained executive chef, lover of cars, avid scuba diver, a member of the Guild of Sommeliers, and a vocal advocate for animal rights.Licensed in Arizona, California, Texas, and Washington.NMLS# 935701AZ LO# 0922834CA License # CA-DBO935701WA License MLO-935701"
