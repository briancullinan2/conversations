The programs run in private schools, charter schools, youth clubs, sports clubs, public schools, in public libraries, community colleges, and even inside private and public corporate offices.  Bottom line is, the programs connect the teens with their purpose and ignite real-life skills. Plus, parents see what their teens can accomplish all on their own, when given the chance.The programs involve community leaders, school administrators, highly motivated teens, lost teens, and their relevant family and influentials ('the village')I'm a huge advocate of real-life-based education, entrepreneurial-inspired workforce development, purpose-based learning methods, ISD and niche skills development.  Rising Tycoons does this for youth, and sparks our youth onto paths that make them recognize their talents, passions and ability to drive results independently, and collaboratively with their peers and community.  An amazing woman named Olenka Cullinan has proven her keen ability to inspire youth for many years, ALL OVER THE WORLD!  My son went through one of her summer workshops and experienced a notable growth process that solidified his professional interests, and drove his confidence to even higher levels.It's absolutely amazing and fulfilling to experience as an adult, an extraordinary effort to support as a business leader, and the results are tangible. Olenka's students who participate in the Rising Tycoons Academies' after school programs even end up launching real businesses by the end of the school year.  The businesses generate revenue, and one student even got funded on Shark Tank!  Thankfully, Olenka has the extreme levels of energy and ability to connect and inspire teens (and tweens), and parents, and school administrators, and community business leaders...everyone involved. I'm honored and excited to be an adviser and occasional instructor."
