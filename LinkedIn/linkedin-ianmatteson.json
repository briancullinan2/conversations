During the process, he will share his creativity to show you the many ways you can craft a deal, he will show the patience of a true mentor when you challenge his ideas, he will help you understand and navigate the internal and external politics that are part of any deal or situation and he will challenge you to do the best you ever done to close the deal.If you get to work with Ian consider yourself a lucky individual because, without a doubt, you will learn something from him that you can reuse throughout your sales career, no matter how much experience you have in the sales arena."

During the process, he will share his creativity to show you the many ways you can craft a deal, he will show the patience of a true mentor when you challenge his ideas, he will help you understand and navigate the internal and external politics that are part of any deal or situation and he will challenge you to do the best you ever done to close the deal.If you get to work with Ian consider yourself a lucky individual because, without a doubt, you will learn something from him that you can reuse throughout your sales career, no matter how much experience you have in the sales arena."
