The challenge, a Right Now! initiative, is set by His Holiness Pope Francis and The Pontifical Council for Justice & Peace, and the competition is open to applicants from all continents and faiths.The Laudato Si’ Challenge will forge a business model to demonstrate that business solutions can realign our relationships to accord with the planet, our only common home. Wherever there is a vulnerable ecosystem, there are vulnerable people; any service to mitigate the crisis involving our common home is also a service to the world’s most disadvantaged people. The inaugural challenge was launched on May 5th, 2017 at The Vatican, and aims to become a multi-year initiative to stimulate and develop innovative businesses through a rigorous and tested process.MISSIONThe Laudato Si’ Challenge, Inspired by Pope Francis will unite humanity in common purpose and productive conversation, much like His Holiness Pope Francis’s “Revolution of Tenderness.” It will be a beacon of new business, inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs to build for-profit, for-purpose companies that address humanity’s biggest challenges in ways that are beneficial to all.http://laudatosichallenge.org"

Level-setting expectations and gaining buy-in from the organization at ALL levels requires that people understand what they are buying-in to.  Thus, from the executive level down to the individual contributor, everyone attends TRAINING.COACHINGThe next step is COACHING to ensure that the organization can make advances without reinventing the wheel, making costly mistakes which others have already made.  The Agile Coach works with clients to build an agenda based upon their needs.  The Agile Coach engages in activities based upon their core competencies:  Coaching and Facilitating, Teaching and Mentoring, Agile Knowledge and Application, Domain Mastery (Technical, Business, Transformational), and Leadership.  The end goal of COACHING is to help clients develop mastery of their own upon which to draw so that they may coach others.SPEAKING AND FACILITATIONFinally, there is evangelism and advocacy through SPEAKING AND FACILITATION.  As the organization continues to grow and establish its own maturity, there are times when reinforcement and external perspective provide energy to continue on with the cultural shift.  This is where events can play a key role in maintaining that organizational momentum and drive toward continuous improvement."
