She offers struggling students the one-on-one attention needed to master the material presented in the school format. She serves all students in the Flagstaff Area.100% of the students who need help in Algebra 1 never mastered Long Division. Long Division is taught in 5th grade and sometimes elementary teachers learn a different technique and instruct their students in that manner. Unfortunately, this consistently creates a problem for the student when the skills needed to master concepts needed in Algebra 1 were never developed. At FlagMath students who struggle in all areas of Mathematics benefit from one on one instruction. This provides a safe place to ask their necessary questions. When students finally understand that one piece which is missing for them, all the pieces come together and the learning takes place exponentially. It is amazing to witness that happening. Tutoring hours at FlagMath are weekdays from after school until 9:00 p.m. Classes are offered on Saturdays for SAT/ACT preparation."

        "summary": "    Anticipated Graduation: May 2017. I am focused on two fields of Computer Science: Bio-Informatics and Big Data. NAU offers (next semester ) the course \"Introduction to Bio-Informatics\"  to prepare for this course I enrolled in two Biology courses, the main course being Biology of the Cell, during the summer session. Data Structures will prepare me for the many options towards Big Data. This is an exciting field and quite challenging to return to school after such a long hiatus.I will be attending the Grace Hopper Conference this week and am so pleased with the opportunities it offers!  Presently, I am searching for an exciting internship  in the New England Area for summer of 2016.The professors at NAU are an excellent mix of academic and industry experience. They are very dedicated to the success of their students.\n  \n  \n",
