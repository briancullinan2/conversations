He is a great leader and mentor, who sees potential in people and grow them to become successful in their careers. He provides the right amount of guidance so that designers are heading in the right direction with the freedom to innovate while he removes the barriers and hurdles that halts great design. There are also times that he would let you struggle a bit so that you push boundaries to make your own way to become a more mature designer. All of this he does is in a personal level that is unique to each person.I have learned a great deal from Thomas and I know he will always be there to provide inspiration and mentorship. I would definitely work on his team again."

        "summary": "    I was going to put something clever here, but decided to keep it simple: my goal isn't to have the user throw back their chair in excitement and declare how clever some shiny widget on the page is. Instead, through a balance of ux strategy, design, and leadership, I want my work and the work of my team to get out of the user's way. At the end of the day, when they have that \"I had a good day and got stuff done\" moment, I will know our work added to that sense of satisfaction.When all is said and done, if their experience was simple, pleasant, and rewarding, they will keep coming back, telling their peers, and engaging in a meaningful way. While that makes me all warm and fuzzy, let's face it, that's also the experience you can monetize.Engagement + Satisfaction = MonetizationSpecialties: Innovation, Building and Managing UX Teams, Marrying Design and Product Strategy, Interaction Design, User Experience, Usability, Prototyping, Software Lifecycle, Front-end Design, CSS\n  \n  \n",
