Study Sauce (https://studysauce.com/) looks like a useful tool; I've always had an issue throughout college keeping track of deadlines, etc. and ended up buying a huge calendar for my wall to pre-input my syllabus deadlines at the beginning of the semester, etc.\n\nAnyhow, great meeting and hope to talk to you soon.\n\nBest,\nBrady Gentile\nbmgentile@gmail.com",
