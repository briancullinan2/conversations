Ali and I were co-founders of our respective companies that participated in the LearnLaunch educational technology accelerator program from September 2015 to May 2016. Ali was an ideal colleague and fellow entrepreneur. In addition to the personal traits I laid out above, Ali shows the qualities you would  want in a business leader: industry knowledge, unrelenting resourcefulness, and a true connection with parents of school-aged children, for whom Ali and Skookii intend to give back lost time and wasted money. I enjoyed working with Ali, and I learned a great deal from him about my own business."
