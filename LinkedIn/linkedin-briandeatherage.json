We have worked with them on dozens of projects for web and TV and recommend them without hesitation.When we need aerial video, Phoenix Drone Service is our ONLY choice due to their professionalism; extensive knowledge of drone operation and law; and creative capabilities. When I tell my clients that I'm bringing an FAA 333 exempt drone operator to a shoot, they are impressed. I also love to brag about Brian and Mark being featured in national publications like HuffPo. Brian and Mark help make me look good :)From my perspective as a video producer, hiring Phoenix Drone Service means I can be confident that I've done my due diligence to ensure legal liabilities are at a minimum on shoot day. I also know that I'm going to get the highest quality footage because Mark and Brian are constantly investing in the latest equipment and focused on professional development. Best of all: they are easy to work with. You won't find a better, more reliable drone operator ... or nicer folks."
