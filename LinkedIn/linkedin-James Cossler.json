But, the quality that most impresses me about Brittany, is that she views herself as a lifetime \"student\". Constantly looking to learn, to broaden her knowledge, to improve her skills. And better yet, Brittany also views herself as a \"teacher\", readily willing to share all of that with those around her. Reduced mathematically, on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate Brittany a 17."
