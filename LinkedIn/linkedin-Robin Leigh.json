Because of the success I have enjoyed with staging for both myself and my clients, I made the decision to expand into opening and operating a full service staging company in February of 2013.Through experience I have come to recognize professional home staging is one of the most important and valuable tools available to any property owner. Our company is committed to making staging available to anyone in any price point who wants to maximize their return on equity and reduce the length of time involved in the selling process."

My experience as a Realtor and Home Stager introduced me to Furniture Banks and I've learned that the majority of people don't know that when the less fortunate finally obtain housing, they almost never have a bed to sleep in or a simple dining table and chairs where they can eat their meals.  These are 'luxuries' most of us take for granted.   Many children are literally sleeping on floors because they don't have a bed; NO child should have to sleep on a floor in the United States of America.My intent is to expand public awareness of this situation and help increase revenue and furniture donations for Furniture Banks. Furniture Banks collect new and used home furnishings, along with cash contributions from public and private donors (who receive tax deductions for their donations) and then purchase and/or repair and refurbish the furnishings they bring in.  They then distribute these same household items to people who are in need throughout our community.I am educating the real estate community about the need for these items and working to educate our clients to help supply Furniture Banks with their client's own donated household furnishings.  Often these same items are discarded or sold for pennies on the dollar: the public isn't aware of the significant needs of Furniture Banks or of the purpose they serve.  Also the public is unaware of the personal tax benefits available to them when donating.
