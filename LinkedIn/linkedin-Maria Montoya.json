I partnered with  Katie on planning for and setting up several public events while at Galvanize (Specifically, our Partner Open House, and our Student Capstone Day). She was incredibly responsive, which allowed me to focus on the content of the events, rather than focusing on the logistics and set up (which she took total ownership of). Both events were wildly successful, and went off without a hitch. I high recommend Katie if you're looking for an events and/or coordination powerhouse."
