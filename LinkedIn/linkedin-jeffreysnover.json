Power Shell is an incredibly useful tool that allows users to automate and control tasks and applications that run on Windows.  Anyone working with the Windows operating system would be remiss in not making themselves familiar with an application that makes one’s administration work easier and more efficient.  Jeffrey introduced this technology in a way that explained the basics to a novice such as myself, yet simultaneously brought expert level users up to date with the changes in Power Shell, through his mastery of blending everyday language with complex technological terminology--an especially useful skill when speaking in front of an audience comprised of people with mixed abilities and levels of competence.

He creates clarity and energy which enables teams to deliver.I both worked for Kendall and worked with him as a peer at Tivoli between 1998 and 2000.  Kendall has the ability to take a wide range of goals, constraints and concerns and transform them into a coherent and compelling plan that was communicated in a clear and concise way.  Kendall's clarity and energy enabled his teams to prioritize their work and work independently and effectively towards a common goal.  When conflicts arose, Kendall resolved them quickly and decisively.  More importantly, he did so grounding his decisions in a set of clear principals which provided both transparency and allowed teams to auto-resolve other issues.I worked with Kendall during the internet bubble where organizations hemorrhaged people to startup companies. Tivoli was no exception and our project was rocked many times with waves of people leaving - often at the worst times possible. I've never been more impressed with a manager than I was watching Kendall manage this very difficult period.  Kendall *managed* the situation.  There was no drama.  Kendall would come to  work in the morning and face yet another wave of difficult news.  For him was  just a new set of facts.  He looked at what our goals were, looked at the options before him and generated a new set of facts that allowed him to achieve our goals.  The range of difficult situations we encountered were almost absurd and yet step by step, Kendall managed the situation effectively with clarity and composure. Again - I consider Kendall to be the gold standard of effective executives.I worked for Kendall as an architect. Kendall is very technical and would often have me drill into the details of particular issues. That said, he struck a great balance between involved and empowering. He wanted to understand the details and the ramifications and the empowered me to make a set of decisions.  He was not shy to override my calls when he had data/context that I did not.  That never felt good but when it occurred but when it did, Kendall was firm, gracious, and generous with his time to explain his decision making and provide the missing data/context.  In doing so, he made it easy for me to support the new approach with conviction and gave me a new set of things to think about as I made my decisions.  He made me a better architect.As I said above - I consider Kendall to be the gold standard of effective executives."

Kendall is very technical and would often have me drill into the details of particular issues. That said, he struck a great balance between involved and empowering. He wanted to understand the details and the ramifications and the empowered me to make a set of decisions.  He was not shy to override my calls when he had data/context that I did not.  That never felt good but when it occurred but when it did, Kendall was firm, gracious, and generous with his time to explain his decision making and provide the missing data/context.  In doing so, he made it easy for me to support the new approach with conviction and gave me a new set of things to think about as I made my decisions.  He made me a better architect.As I said above - I consider Kendall to be the gold standard of effective executives."

                "Kendall is a highly effective executive with a strong track record of managing difficult situations to success.  He creates clarity and energy which enables teams to deliver.I both worked for Kendall and worked with him as a peer at Tivoli between 1998 and 2000.  Kendall has the ability to take a wide range of goals, constraints and concerns and transform them into a coherent and compelling plan that was communicated in a clear and concise way.  Kendall's clarity and energy enabled his teams to prioritize their work and work independently and effectively towards a common goal.  When conflicts arose, Kendall resolved them quickly and decisively.  More importantly, he did so grounding his decisions in a set of clear principals which provided both transparency and allowed teams to auto-resolve other issues.I worked with Kendall during the internet bubble where organizations hemorrhaged people to startup companies. Tivoli was no exception and our project was rocked many times with waves of people leaving - often at the worst times possible. I've never been more impressed with a manager than I was watching Kendall manage this very difficult period.  Kendall *managed* the situation.  There was no drama.  Kendall would come to  work in the morning and face yet another wave of difficult news.  For him was  just a new set of facts.  He looked at what our goals were, looked at the options before him and generated a new set of facts that allowed him to achieve our goals.  The range of difficult situations we encountered were almost absurd and yet step by step, Kendall managed the situation effectively with clarity and composure. Again - I consider Kendall to be the gold standard of effective executives.I worked for Kendall as an architect.

                "June is one of the best technical writers that I have ever worked with and I consider June a partner in making PowerShell what it is today.  When I met June, she had so many great ideas about how to better engage with customers that I had to have her work on PowerShell.  I worked with June for many years and in addition to being a great writer, she was always an incredible advocate for our customers.  She spent a lot of time with actual customers both telling them about our products and listening for how to make both the documentation and the product better.  Many of the things in PowerShell are extremely technical and June did a great job understanding them and suggesting ways to simplify things.  When June had an idea, everyone on the team would stop and listen.  That is not to say that we always agreed but we always took to time to evaluate her recommendations.  In those discussions, June made clear and concise arguments for her position and then fully committed herself to plan whether it went her way or not.  June's ability to work with a wide range of engineers, quickly come up to speed on highly technical subjects, develop strategies for documenting them successfully, engagement with the customer community and ability to drive customer feedback into product development, made June one of the best partners we had in making PowerShell a success.  I cannot say enough positive things about June and her contributions to PowerShell and the PowerShell community."
