        "summary": "    As a recruiter I go above and beyond the typical recruiter job description.  I don't wait for the candidates to come to me, I am searching them out through different means.  I have implemented new tools to help us ensure we are focusing on candidate experience.  I am communicating with the hiring managers and continue to build their trust in me ad see me as a Business partner versus a work horse, although I am that as well.  I am in talks with Meetups and Conferences to figure out what events we should attend, what events we can speak at and what events we can have a presence at.  I am passionate about employer brand and candidate experience. I own a farm and currently have 7 horses,  2 cows, 2 dogs and a cat.  When i am done with work I am outside riding, feeding or cleaning.  I love Denver Broncos and STL Cardinals, although I don't know any players so you might think i'm not.   Why STL Cardinals you might ask, I went to school in Missouri and fell in love and have been a fan since.  I played soccer and was a goalkeeper all through college, although I have not played much in a few years.  I also love to shoot my compound bow and can get a good cluster going. \n  \n  \n",
