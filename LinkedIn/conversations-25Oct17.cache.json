I noticed your background in quality assurance engineering and am hoping to gain some insight into what talented engineers would be interested in hearing about? Thanks!\n\n Melody Fisher\nmfisher@teksystems.com\n\nSteve McVey on Oct 25, 10:30 AM\n================\nHi Melody,\n\nThanks for your note. I'm afraid my tech skills are woefully out of date, having been in software sales for some time. I do know of a friend who is looking for a development/engineering position. Would you be open to a referral?\n\nSteve M.\n\nMelody Fisher on Oct 25, 10:32 AM\n================\nThanks for your response Steve! I am always open to referrals as I am big on networking. I would love to speak with your friend, is there a name and # you could provide me?\n\nSteve McVey on Oct 25, 10:35 AM\n================\nLet me run the details you sent past him and I will make an Email introduction if he has interest.",

    "message": "It's definitely an interesting resume.\n\nHave you put much thought into what kind of position you want to get? Your intro has many skills that you're unlikely to find in a single new position at a larger organization. At least it won't be advertised as needing them all \"Software Engineer, Network Admin, Mobile/Web/UI/UX Developer\". I find it's often best to tune your resume to the position you want to find.\n\nThat way you can more thoroughly highlight the activities you did at each position that contributed to the development of that skill. This helps your resume read more about how you're qualified for the position you want.\n\nIf you're looking for a jack of all trades position you should probably look towards more startups / small businesses. If that's what you're going for this resume is great, although most small business / early stage startups that I've worked with hire more based on people they know than resumes and recruiting.\n\nAaron",
