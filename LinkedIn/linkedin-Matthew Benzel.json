He is a very skilled web developer with a great ability to foresee problems with a particular design before it gets implemented.  Not only is Arvind a good software developer but he is a good human being as well. I am thankful for the time I got to spend working with Arvind and I am positive he will always be a tremendous asset in his future endeavors."
