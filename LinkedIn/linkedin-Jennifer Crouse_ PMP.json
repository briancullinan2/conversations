I inherited the project after multiple reorgs, on both the client and internal side, and Rhonda was the saving grace that took the time to make sure I understood the technicalities, in addition to the politics, that drove many of the decisions on this specific account. Rhonda is a true business professional who understands not just the technical components of a project, but also takes the time to understand the business needs and drivers. She is proactive with providing the appropriate business solutions and planning ahead for risk. In addition to Rhonda's strong technical skills, she is also a great team leader and mentor. She will step up when needed and provide direction if she foresees gaps that impact the project's success. Rhonda is truly committed to making sure deliverables meet and/or exceed their requirements.  It was a pleasure not only working with Rhonda, but learning from her, as she is a true professional and impactful team member.
