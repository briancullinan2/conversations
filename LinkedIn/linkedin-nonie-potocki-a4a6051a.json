                "Laura is one of the most inspiring professors and women I know. She is clear and concise in her expectations in the classroom, yet she challenges her students individually to be the best versions of themselves. She has such a strong passion for Entrepreneurship, and it is evident through her career that she has been more than just successful. Furthermore, she translates that passion to her students. My first course in the business school was with Laura, or \"Professor Z.\" She recognized that as a dance major I had a completely unique background to the other students in the class, but she embraced me and aided whenever I felt behind. Because of her encouragement, I am succeeding in the business school as well as in the Entrepreneurship field. What makes Laura even more unique is her dedication to her students, or clients, outside of the classroom, or office. She has mentored me on multiple projects and has served as an incredible role model in the field. She would make an incredible asset to any team or any university. Her personality is infectious and her knowledge is abundant; she will inspire and lead you to success."

                "Laura is one of the most inspiring professors and women I know. She is clear and concise in her expectations in the classroom, yet she challenges her students individually to be the best versions of themselves. She has such a strong passion for Entrepreneurship, and it is evident through her career that she has been more than just successful. Furthermore, she translates that passion to her students. My first course in the business school was with Laura, or \"Professor Z.\" She recognized that as a dance major I had a completely unique background to the other students in the class, but she embraced me and aided whenever I felt behind. Because of her encouragement, I am succeeding in the business school as well as in the Entrepreneurship field. What makes Laura even more unique is her dedication to her students, or clients, outside of the classroom, or office.
