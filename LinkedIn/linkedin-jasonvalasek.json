                "Jason is the founder and business development executive at Cloud LGS, an online marketing platform to help starter entrepreneurs and business owners grow their business. Jason relocated to Arizona from Nebraska in 2001 to obtain his degree in Computer Science and Information Technology. Passionate about entrepreneurism, Jason moved to San Diego, California, immediately after college graduation to open his first business. Jason has helped multiple start-ups and established businesses reach new levels of revenue not previously seen before Jason's involvement. Today, Jason continues to passionately pursue new growth milestones with select clients and his own business ventures. In his free time he still chooses to stay focused on entrepreneurial-related tasks and initiatives. At this moment, this is his only passion.\"I am absolutely, 100 percent, without a doubt obsessed and completely immersed into entrepreneurism. The last two decades of my life have been focused solely on learning what makes businesses successful and how to provide tools to complement. My passion is finding breakthrough strategies that help businesses solve for missed opportunities. Equally exciting is finding more ways to build on successful strategies. I personally have experienced almost every side of growth and failure in business. I truly believe in the soul of my heart that I've been preparing my entire adult life to build the largest company the world has ever seen. I have no intention of giving up until I do.\""
