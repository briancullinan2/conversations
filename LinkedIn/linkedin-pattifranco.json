        "summary": "    The Number 1 question I get in this industry is, \"What makes you different?\"​ Rather than bore you with how great and progressive my company is and blah blah blah...I have composed a list that I think is more helpful. And accurate. And \"different\"​.1.) I will NOT wear a suit to a client meeting. This is Arizona. It's hot. It's an outdated concept anyway.2.) I will NOT show up uninvited and try to meet with you. Your time is valuable. And so is mine. 3.) I WILL always treat my clients, prospects and candidates with respect. If you say, \"don't call me, I'll call you,\"​ then I respect that. If you say nothing, on the other hand, then I have free reign to be as annoying as I like until you tell me to stop. :)4.) I WILL send my clients, prospects and candidates pithy, off the wall and outside the box communication to lighten the mood. I have been known to send GIF's of women crying to illustrate my sadness when a someone won't return my call or email. You have been warned. 5.) I WILL make mistakes. I am only human. 6.) I WILL own up to my mistakes and do everything possible to correct them.7.) I WILL make you laugh. Even if we never do business together I promise to, if nothing else, provide comedic entertainment. 8.) I will NOT mislead you or take you down a path of no return. If I'm not the right recruiter for you, I'll tell you. Nicely. Usually. 9.) I will NOT take my position lightly. This is my career...not a job. However, I won't take it so seriously that I wind up with ulcers and grey hair. Okay, more grey hair.Areas of Expertise: Recruiting; Staffing; Temporary Placement; Executive Placement; Contract Staffing; Business Development.
