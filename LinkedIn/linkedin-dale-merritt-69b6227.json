        "summary": "    A serial entrepreneur that looks for opportunities in some of the most competitive but lucrative industries. I've got a great passion for start ups, getting initial traction, then applying my experience to ramp up quickly. I'm all about the network effect, and partnering with great companies. I've always relished the idea of market competition.  I've raised 1+ million in investment from several strategic investors, and closed multiple investment rounds with various companies.  I've built up and sold 6 companies during that time, diversified across many industries including residential security, solar companies, and even a fixed wireless internet company.  My latest venture is in the golf industry, and mobile marketing to golfers.  It combines my obsession for golf and my penchant for start-ups. \n  \n  \n",
