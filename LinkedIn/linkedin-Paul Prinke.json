        "summary": "    Entrepreneur and Intraprenuer at the core… the sky is the limit.Experienced contact center operations program manager and developer; the man behind the curtain as some would like to call it.Automation and Process Improvement – Working with technology today is not the as it was 20 years ago.  With the increase in activities we complete via our computers and phones, certain processes can be streamlined and improved.  For example, I was tasked to automate and develop an application to gather metrics for an extremely unique application.  This presented an interesting challenge as the systems to find metrics are completely disparate and some specific to locations.  The game plan was to create a database to receive the metrics, build a web driven frontend to administer the process.  Through the build out of this process, the business was not required to hire additional headcount to complete this work nor was there a need to offshore it to save money.  Amazing what technology can do to help the bottom-line.Web Application Development – From small businesses to non-profits organizations to large complex operations, there is always a way to drive efficiencies through web applications. The key factor with web applications is that it must enable a standardized process. Take a small reseller for example; business operated by a team of 5 people where 3 of them are remote workers and systems are either old, home-grown, or client system specific.  Through a single web application interface display Quickbooks data for customer purchase orders, factory purchase orders, revenue trending, shipment tracking and a notification engine to automate some communication between the business and its many customers.Methodology – My way is the “Agile” way.  Through agile development, not only is there always an open channel of communication but the constant feedback provided by software deliveries allows me to meet objectives on-time and load a quality product to the customer as expected.Specialties: Innovative\n  \n  \n",
