                "I worked directly under Chris for about 6 months as a server/storage specialist and continued to work with him on Curvature's server and storage projects in the following years as the business grew from $10M to $30M.First and foremost, Chris is an employees' manager.  He will do anything and everything he can to enable his employees to be their best and get their projects completed.  Through our one on one meetings, Chris worked with me to carve out time during the week to get away from day to day tasks and work on projects that improved the overall productivity of the server and storage team.  This was especially difficult early in Chris' move to management of the server and storage team as some team members were happy with the status quo.  It took leadership from Chris to ease the concerns of these team members and continue making changes and pushing the development of projects that improved the productivity of the team.Chris identifies areas of inefficiency and pushes for projects that make real improvements to overall productivity.  During the infancy of the server and storage program at Curvature, the server/storage team had the painstaking task of sorting through server parts and components one by one to satisfy a requirement from sales.  Chris identified the inefficiency and implemented his knowledge from previous positions to start a project whereby all server parts and components would be aggregated for quick review.  He then rolled out the solution to sales people in order to train them on server and storage components thereby reducing the burden on the server/storage team.  This project significantly improved the productivity of sales and the server/storage team alike and was a significant factor in our growth of the business.Finally, Chris is a terrific mentor for employees.  During my time working for Chris and in the years since, he has always been available to discuss anything and everything.  It was nice knowing I always had somebody in my corner who I could reach out to when I needed career advice over the years.  Chris was always happy to dispense his knowledge and experience and I can't thank him for his insight!"

                "I worked directly under Chris for about 6 months as a server/storage specialist and continued to work with him on Curvature's server and storage projects in the following years as the business grew from $10M to $30M.First and foremost, Chris is an employees' manager.  He will do anything and everything he can to enable his employees to be their best and get their projects completed.  Through our one on one meetings, Chris worked with me to carve out time during the week to get away from day to day tasks and work on projects that improved the overall productivity of the server and storage team.  This was especially difficult early in Chris' move to management of the server and storage team as some team members were happy with the status quo.  It took leadership from Chris to ease the concerns of these team members and continue making changes and pushing the development of projects that improved the productivity of the team.Chris identifies areas of inefficiency and pushes for projects that make real improvements to overall productivity.  During the infancy of the server and storage program at Curvature, the server/storage team had the painstaking task of sorting through server parts and components one by one to satisfy a requirement from sales.  Chris identified the inefficiency and implemented his knowledge from previous positions to start a project whereby all server parts and components would be aggregated for quick review.  He then rolled out the solution to sales people in order to train them on server and storage components thereby reducing the burden on the server/storage team.  This project significantly improved the productivity of sales and the server/storage team alike and was a significant factor in our growth of the business.Finally, Chris is a terrific mentor for employees.  During my time working for Chris and in the years since, he has always been available to discuss anything and everything.  It was nice knowing I always had somebody in my corner who I could reach out to when I needed career advice over the years.  Chris was always happy to dispense his knowledge and experience and I can't thank him for his insight!"
