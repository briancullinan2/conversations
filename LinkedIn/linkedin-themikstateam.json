Steve's follow through and attention to detail, both during the loan process and after, were wonderful.  We were working on a very tight schedule and had \"out of the norm\" circumstances with relocating and owning other property out of state, but Steve was able to deliver as promised and surpassed our expectations in every way.  I would definitely recommend him to friends, family and colleagues and we plan to utilize his services for any future loan needs that may come up.  Steve is resourceful, friendly, honest and reliable.  I don't think you could find a better person to handle your mortgage needs.  Steve had a scheduled trip that required him to leave the country just before our loan was funded, which might make some clients uneasy  Due to his thoroughness, he was able to hand off the funding of our loan to his very capable colleagues for a seamless transition and closing.  Phenomenal service by Steve and everyone on his team!"

Steve's follow through and attention to detail, both during the loan process and after, were wonderful.  We were working on a very tight schedule and had \"out of the norm\" circumstances with relocating and owning other property out of state, but Steve was able to deliver as promised and surpassed our expectations in every way.  I would definitely recommend him to friends, family and colleagues and we plan to utilize his services for any future loan needs that may come up.  Steve is resourceful, friendly, honest and reliable.  I don't think you could find a better person to handle your mortgage needs.  Steve had a scheduled trip that required him to leave the country just before our loan was funded, which might make some clients uneasy  Due to his thoroughness, he was able to hand off the funding of our loan to his very capable colleagues for a seamless transition and closing.  Phenomenal service by Steve and everyone on his team!"

        "summary": "    With a background in MIS and 10 years of Mortgage Originator Experience, my new position is allowing me to build the mortgage industry's first ever organization-wide CRM platform. We are building a revolutionary Sales & Operations Experience for Loan Originators, Processors, and an entire company to transform the way that clients will obtain a mortgage in the future.Originally from the Chicagoland area, I chose to move out west in 2004 after receiving a degree in Management Information Systems/Finance. I fell into the mortgage industry in 2004 in Arizona, when the market was red hot. Over the next couple years, the market began to slow and I began to manage the relationships that I had with clients and partners much more closely. Starting in 2008 I began to develop a platform to help me better manage these relationships in addition to streamlining and automating the complicated mortgage process. From 2009 to 2012, my team's production grew from $12.5M to over $50M in mortgage originations. In 2013 I was introduced to VIP Mortgage with a new job - implement this platform throughout an entire organization. VIP is poised to triple production from 2013 to 2016 and we are looking to reinvent the mortgage industry with Professional Loan Originators who want to do large production while providing the best possible service to their clients. We are focused on building relationships for life and helping those with HEART accomplish more together than they ever could alone.\n  \n  \n",
