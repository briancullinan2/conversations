It's membership ranks swelled to over 1,000 members during my years of service, and we operated 13 stations 24x7x365 at the time.  I personally accumulated over 2,000 hours of volunteer time in the two years I was active, which pales in comparison to some of the members who were there from the start, accumulating over 30,000 hours.This was an extremely rewarding educational experience for me and a great way to serve my community at the time.  Being regularly involved in life or death situations is a real adrenaline rush, but it also teaches a respect and appreciation for the fragility of human life, and true empathy for those who experience loss.  Being involved in a mass casualty incident gave me experience in maintaining calm and focus in a crisis situation, directing my energy towards providing safety and relief for those who were in harm's way, while keeping my team and myself safe."
