As a result, she proceeded to meet and exceed all sales expectations during her time at Nordstrom. This unveiled a plethora of natural leadership qualities that myself, and other associates, highly valued. Fahren understands completing tasks alone or with a team and is truly a force to be reckoned with. It was a pleasure to work with someone so confident and flexible in various situations. She understands how to prioritize projects while also displaying clear and direct communication skills. Fahren is an asset to any employer. They would be lucky to have her! I have no doubt that she will always produce above and beyond results."
