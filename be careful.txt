WORLD'S CHRISTIAN CHURCH   FINALLY REVEALS THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TRUE   SHAPE OF THE EARTH & GOD'S REAL CREATION EXPOSED!  When Bible speaks for the TRUTH:  Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?  It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in.   - Isaiah 40:21‭-‬22 KJV  The word \"Circle\" in Hebrew means \"Chuwg\"   (Flat Disk/Coin)   Now, what's in the \"beginning\"?  Here's the answer:   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.  And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.    And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:  And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,  And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  - Genesis 1:1‭-‬10‭, ‬14‭-‬19 KJV  ================================  Biblical Evidence supporting a stationary Flat Earth:  The Earth is stationary:  Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. (1 Chronicles 16:30, KJV)  Yahuwah reigneth, He is clothed with majesty; Yahuwah is clothed with strength, wherewith He hath girded Himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. (See Psalm 93:1.)  Say among the heathen that Yahuwah reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: He shall judge the people righteously. (See Psalm 96:10.)  Bless Yahuwah, O my soul. O Yahuwah my Elohim, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty. . . . Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever. (See Psalm 104:1, 5.)  The Earth and the heavenly bodies are enclosed by the firmament:  And Elohim said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And Elohim made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And Elohim called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. (See Genesis 1:6-8.)  Here, we find that Yahuwah created the expanse of the heavens by separating \"the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.\"  It could not be any clearer; there is water both below the firmament and above the firmament.   Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. (Psalm 148:4, KJV)  According to Genesis 1:6-8, there is water both below the firmament and above the firmament.  The word translated as \"firmament\" here is H7549:  H7549 - râqı̂ya‛  BDB Definition:   1) extended surface (solid), expanse, firmament  1a) expanse (flat as base, support)  1b) firmament (of vault of heaven supporting waters above)  1b1) considered by Hebrews as solid and supporting ‘waters’ above  Note BDB's recognition that the firmament refers to the \"vault of heaven supporting waters above,\" and adds that it was \"considered by Hebrews as solid and supporting ‘waters’ above.\"  The root of H7549 (râqı̂ya‛) is H7554 (râqa‛), which is defined by Strong's as:  \"A primitive root; to pound the earth (as a sign of passion); by analogy to expand (by hammering); by implication to overlay (with thin sheets of metal): —beat, make broad, spread abroad (forth, over, out, into plates), stamp, stretch\" -Strong's Concordance  The firmament that holds back the waters above appears from its root word to be solid, as if hammered out like a sheet of metal.   Scripture goes on to state that the heavenly bodies were placed inside this firmament.  And Elohim said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And Elohim made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And Elohim set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and Elohim saw that it was good. (See Genesis 1:14-18.)  The firmament is solid in nature:  In the following passage, Elihu in his conversation with Job confirms what we have already learned from the Creation account in Genesis, namely that the firmament that separates the waters and houses the heavenly bodies is solid.  Note that Elihu uses H7554 (râqa‛), the root word of firmament, which means \"by analogy to expand (by hammering); by implication to overlay (with thin sheets of metal): —beat, make broad, spread abroad (forth, over, out, into plates), stamp, stretch.\"  Hast thou with him spread out [H7554 - râqa‛] the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass? (Job 37:18, KJV)  Now, let us examine a key passage often quoted by those advocating the globe model:  It is he that sitteth upon the circle [H2329 - chûg] of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in. (Isaiah 40:22, KJV)  The word used here to denote \"circle\" is H2329 (chûg).  It quite literally means circle, circuit, or compass, and by extension can refer to the vault of the heavens.  It does not mean \"ball\" or \"sphere.\"  H2329 - chûg  BDB Definition:  1) circle, circuit, compass  2) (BDB) vault (of the heavens)  H2329 (chûg) is in no way indicative of a ball or sphere.  Isaiah, under divine inspiration, was deliberate in his word choice here; he did not lack a word for \"ball,\" as can clearly be seen in the following passage:  He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball [H1754 - dûr] into a large country . . . (Isaiah 22:18, KJV)  Isaiah, when referring to a ball penned H1754 (dûr) not H2329 (chûg).  These are mutually exclusive expressions.  It is important to note here that H2329 (chûg) can refer to the \"vault of the heavens\" which, in context, seems the most fitting application of its usage in this passage.  Let us look at it again:  It is he that sitteth upon the circle [H2329 - chûg] of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens [H8064 - shâmayim] as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in. (Isaiah 40:22, KJV)  This passage tells us that Yahuwah sits upon the vault of the heavens above the Earth1 and that from His vantage point, the inhabitants of Earth appear like grasshoppers.  Yahuwah, of course, is omnipresent and does not need to strain His eyes to see the inhabitants of Earth, but the picture that Isaiah is painting is quite clear.  This passage also tells us that Yahuwah stretches out the heavens [H8064 - shâmayim] like a \"curtain\" and spreads them out like \"a tent.\"  The word used here to denote \"the heavens\" is the same word used in Genesis to identify the firmament:  And Elohim called the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] Heaven [H8064 - shâmayim]. And the evening and the morning were the second day. (See Genesis 1:8.)  What Isaiah is communicating then is that Father Yahuwah sits upon (or above) the firmament which is stretched over the Earth like a tent.  (Scripture continually says that Yahuwah stretches out the heavens, or shâmayim: Psalm 104:2, Job 9:8, Isa. 40:22; 42:5; 44:24; 45:12; 51:13, Jer. 10:12; 51:15, Zec. 12:1)     Isaiah tells us that Father Yahuwah sits upon (or above) the firmament which He stretches over the Earth like \"a curtain\" or \"a tent.\" (See Isaiah 40:22.)  This analogy would make no sense in the context of a globe.  Eliphaz, in the book of Job, agrees with this interpretation, for he says that Yahuwah walks upon the chûg (H2329), the same word used by Isaiah to denote the vault of heaven:  J.P. Green's literal rendering of Job 22:14 -   \"and vault [H2329] - the heavens [H8064] - He walks\"  Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit [H2329 - chûg] of heaven [H8064 - shâmayim]. (Job 22:14, KJV)  Eliphaz clearly believed that Yahuwah dwelled [dwells] at the zenith of the firmament.  Is not El in the height of heaven [H8064 - shâmayim]? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! (See Job 22:12.)  Solomon, in his commentary on the Creation account, reinforces what we have learned thus far from the pen of Moses, Isaiah, and the author of Job:  When he prepared the heavens [H8064 - shâmayim], I was there: when he set a compass [H2329 - chûg] upon the face of the depth: When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth. (Proverbs 8:27-29, KJV)  Here, again, we find the same word used to identify the firmament, or the heavens: chûg (H2329)  \"Praise ye Him, sun and moon: praise Him, all ye stars of light. Praise Him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens. . . . for His name alone is excellent; His glory is above the earth and heaven.\" (Psalm 148:3-4, 13.)  Solomon, in the above passage, is restating what Yahuwah did during Creation week (See Genesis 1:2.)  In context, it appears that Solomon is speaking specifically about where the physical firmament rests upon the deep, for he says plainly after speaking about the preparation of the heavens [H8064 - shâmayim] that the chûg (H2329) was set \"upon the face of the depth.\"  Another very reasonable interpretation is that Solomon, here, is referring to the outer circle of ice established by Yahuwah to contain the seas, for he goes on to say that:  [H]e gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth. (Proverbs 8:29, KJV)  Regardless of which of these interpretations one adheres to, one thing is certain: it is nowhere even hinted that the earth is a globe.  All of the Biblical references examined so far irrefutably depict a flat earth enclosed by the firmament of heaven.  Let us now examine a most remarkable vision recorded by the prophet Ezekiel:  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens [H8064 - shâmayim] were opened, and I saw visions of Elohim. . . . And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. . . . And the likeness of the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. And under the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. And there was a voice from the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. And above the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahuwah. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. (See Ezekiel 1:1,4,5,22-28.)  Here, Ezekiel tells us:  The heavens [H8064 - shâmayim] were opened. (See Ezekiel 1:1.)  A whirlwind, a great cloud, a fire infolding itself came out of the north.  (See Ezekiel 1:4.)  The \"north,\" in context here, seems to denote the zenith of the heavens, which were opened to him.  Job agrees with this understanding: \"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place . . .\" (See Job 26:7)  Out of this whirlwind of fire came four living creatures. (See Ezekiel 1:5.)  After the living creatures come forth, Ezekiel sees the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] \"stretched forth over their heads.\"  Ezekiel likens the firmament to a \"terrible crystal.\" (See Ezekiel 1:22.)  The word translated as \"crystal\" here is H7140 (qerach) which means \"frost, ice, ice crystal.\"  This suggests that the water above the firmament is frozen (or at least has the appearance of ice).  This is likely what the Apostle John also saw in his vision: \"Before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.\" (Revelation 4:6) The Greek word translated as \"crystal\" here is krustallos (G2930), which is \"used in classical Greek for ice.\" (Vincent's Word Studies)  Much more could be said about this, but it is not in the scope of this study to dig further into this particular goldmine.  A voice called to the living creatures from the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛] that was above them. (See Ezekiel 1:25.)  Ezekiel beholds Yahuwah on His throne above the firmament [H7549 - râqı̂ya‛]. (See Ezekiel 1:26-28.)  Ezekiel, here, has painted a remarkably vivid picture of Yahuwah seated in glory upon His throne above the firmament, which appears to him like an ice crystal.   Who do you trust?  Yahuwah's prophets or the militarized secret society at NASA?  Thus saith the Yahuwah; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from Yahuwah. For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.  Blessed is the man that trusteth in Yahuwah, and whose hope Yahuwah is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit. (See Jeremiah 17:5-8.)  \"GOD CREATED THE EARTH A TERRA-FIRMA\"  (not oblate, not pear-shape, not a ball)  •--\"ALL THINGS CAN BE SEEN\" (Only possible on Flat Earth)  Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. And he said to him, \"All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.\"  - Matthew 4:8‭-‬9 ESV  •-- \"FIRMAMENT\" (Waters above, Waters Below)  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.  And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called the Seas: and God saw that it was good. - Genesis 1:8‭-‬10 KJV  God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the water; let it divide the water from the water” God made the dome and divided the water under the dome from the water above the Dome; that is how it was, and God called the dome Sky. So there was evening, and there was morning, a second day. God called the dry land Earth, the gathering together of the water he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.   -B'resheet (Gen) 1:6‭-‬8‭, ‬10 CJB  Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge, you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind?

I saw the treasuries of all the winds: I saw how He had furnished with them the whole creation and the firm foundations of the earth. 2.

And I saw how the winds stretch out the vaults of heaven, and have their station between heaven and earth: these are the pillars of the heaven . 4. I saw the winds of heaven which turn and bring the circumference of the sun and all the stars to their setting. 5. I saw the winds on the earth carrying the clouds: I saw the paths of the angels. I saw at the end of the earth the firmament of the heaven above. And I proceeded and saw a place which burns day and night, where there are seven mountains of magnificent stones, three towards the east, and three towards the south. 7. And as for those towards the east, 〈 one 〉 was of coloured stone, and one of pearl, and one of jacinth, and those towards the south of red stone. 8. But the middle one reached to heaven like the throne of God, of alabaster, and the summit of the throne was of sapphire. 9. And I saw a flaming fire.

And I saw a deep abyss, with columns of heavenly fire, and among them I saw columns of fire fall, which were beyond measure alike towards the height and towards the depth. 12. And beyond that abyss I saw a place which had no firmament of the heaven above, and no firmly founded earth beneath it: there was no water upon it, and no birds, but it was a waste and horrible place.    \"What is Earth made of based on BIBLE?\"   What is the real characteristic of the Earth based on the Bible?   Let's do something different just to make sure! what if we use different kinds of translations to see if it's consistent? To see if every translations of the bible describes the same characteristics of the flat earth with a solid dome above.  😄  Please take note of the following:  1.

Take time to read.   ===========================================  Common English Version:  When God began to create the heavens and the earth— the earth was without shape or form, it was dark over the deep sea, and God’s wind swept over the waters— God said, \"Let there be light.\" And so light appeared. God saw how good the light was. God separated the light from the darkness. God named the light Day and the darkness Night. There was evening and there was morning: the first day. God said, \"Let there be a dome in the middle of the waters to separate the waters from each other.\" God made the dome and separated the waters under the dome from the waters above the dome. And it happened in that way. God named the dome Sky. There was evening and there was morning: the second day. God said, \"Let the waters under the sky come together into one place so that the dry land can appear.\" And that’s what happened. God named the dry land Earth, and he named the gathered waters Seas. God saw how good it was.   - Genesis 1:1‭-‬10 CEB  God said, \"Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will mark events, sacred seasons, days, and years. They will be lights in the dome of the sky to shine on the earth.\" And that’s what happened. God made the stars and two great lights: the larger light to rule over the day and the smaller light to rule over the night. God put them in the dome of the sky to shine on the earth, to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw how good it was. There was evening and there was morning: the fourth day. God said, \"Let the waters swarm with living things, and let birds fly above the earth up in the dome of the sky.\"  - Genesis 1:14‭-‬20 CEB  ===========================================  American Standard Version:  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.  And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.  - Genesis 1:1‭-‬2‭, ‬4‭-‬10 ASV  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.  - Genesis 1:14‭-‬19 ASV  ===========================================  Catholic Public Domain Bible:  In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. But the earth was empty and unoccupied, and darknesses were over the face of the abyss; and so the Spirit of God was brought over the waters. And God said, \"Let there be light.\" And light became. And God saw the light, that it was good; and so he divided the light from the darknesses. And he called the light, 'Day,' and the darknesses, 'Night.' And it became evening and morning, one day. God also said, \"Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide waters from waters.\" And God made a firmament, and he divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament. And so it became. And God called the firmament 'Heaven.' And it became evening and morning, the second day. Truly God said: \"Let the waters that are under heaven be gathered together into one place; and let the dry land appear.\" And so it became. And God called the dry land, 'Earth,' and he called the gathering of the waters, 'Seas.' And God saw that it was good.  - Genesis 1:1‭-‬10 CPDV  Then God said: \"Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven. And let them divide day from night, and let them become signs, both of the seasons, and of the days and years. Let them shine in the firmament of heaven and illuminate the earth.\" And so it became. And God made two great lights: a greater light, to rule over the day, and a lesser light, to rule over the night, along with the stars. And he set them in the firmament of heaven, to give light over all the earth, and to rule over the day as well as the night, and to divide light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And it became evening and morning, the fourth day.  - Genesis 1:14‭-‬19 CPDV  ===========================================  Orthodox Jewish Bible:  In the beginning Elohim created hashomayim (the heavens, Himel) and haaretz (the earth). And the earth was tohu vavohu (without form, and void); and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Ruach Elohim was hovering upon the face of the waters. And Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light [Tehillim 33:6,9]. And Elohim saw the light, that it was tov (good); and Elohim divided the ohr (light) from the choshech (darkness). And Elohim called the light Yom (Day), and the darkness He called Lailah (Night). And the erev (evening) and the boker (morning) were Yom Echad (Day One, the First Day, Mk 16:2). And Elohim said, Let there be a raki'a (expanse, dome, firmament) in the midst of the mayim (waters), and let it divide the mayim from the mayim. And Elohim made the raki'a, and divided the waters under the raki'a from the waters which were above the raki'a; and it was so. And Elohim called the raki'a Shomayim (Heaven). And the erev and the boker were Yom Sheni (Day Two, the Second Day). And Elohim said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the yabashah (dry land) appear; and it was so. And Elohim called the yabashah Eretz (Earth); and the mikveh (gathering together of the waters) called He Seas; and Elohim saw that it was tov.  - Bereshis 1:1‭-‬10 OJB  And Elohim said, Let there be lights in the raki'a of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for otot (signs), and for mo'adim (seasons), and for yamim (days), and shanim (years); And let them be for lights in the raki'a of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so. And Elohim made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the kokhavim (stars) also. And Elohim set them in the raki'a of the heaven to give light upon the earth, And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and Elohim saw that it was tov. And the erev and the boker were Yom Revi'i (Day Four, the Fourth Day).  - Bereshis 1:14‭-‬19 OJB  ===========================================  New International Version:  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.  And God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light ‘day’, and the darkness he called ‘night’. And there was evening, and there was morning – the first day.  And God said, ‘Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.’ So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault ‘sky’. And there was evening, and there was morning – the second day.  And God said, ‘Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.’ And it was so. God called the dry ground ‘land’, and the gathered waters he called ‘seas’. And God saw that it was good.  - Gen. 1:1‭-‬10 NIVUK  And God said, ‘Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.’ And it was so. God made two great lights – the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. And there was evening, and there was morning – the fourth day.  - Gen. 1:14‭-‬19 NIVUK  ===========================================  Complete Jewish Bible:  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

God saw that the light was good, and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. So there was evening, and there was morning, one day. God said, “Let there be a dome in the middle of the water; let it divide the water from the water.” God made the dome and divided the water under the dome from the water above the dome; that is how it was, and God called the dome Sky. So there was evening, and there was morning, a second day. God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let dry land appear,” and that is how it was. God called the dry land Earth, the gathering together of the water he called Seas, and God saw that it was good.  - B'resheet (Gen) 1:1‭-‬10 CJB  God said, “Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to divide the day from the night; let them be for signs, seasons, days and years; and let them be for lights in the dome of the sky to give light to the earth”; and that is how it was.

./diana_m_wood_5-posts-2017.json:        "description": "As an eye doctor I feel compelled to comment about the upcoming eclipse:  1) You really can PERMANENTLY damage your eyes. So stay inside or learn how to be safe.  2) While some docs say the only safe way to watch is on TV, I do believe you can experience this unique event safely but you MUST be careful.  3) You must wear ISO 12312-2 certified protection if you view the eclipse. Inspect them for scrat ... ches or defects as either of these can make them very dangerous to use  4) Even with approved protective eclipse glasses, GLANCE at the progress but don't stare at it the whole time  5) Turn away from the sun when putting on eclipse glasses and make sure they fit securely. This is especially important for children. Supervise them and make sure no stray sunlight is bypassing the glasses  6) I'm going to have my favorite eye closed and look intermittently with my eclipse glasses protected \"non-dominant\" eye ( http:// www.allaboutvision.com/ resources/ dominant-eye-test.htm )  7) At totality you can take your glasses off but immediately when the \"diamond\" sparkle at the edge of the eclipse starts, turn away and put your eclipse glasses back on  8. Let the pros take the photos. Record the news or check it out later. Any pics you take with your phone will suck...yes even with the latest, greatest phone. A tiny dot of a sun obscured or not, will not be something worthwhile. Enjoy the experience and don't waste it by trying to capture it  9) Look around at your surroundings for unusually lighting effects. There is a lot to see on the ground that will be cool. Light passing through trees can create numerous crescents on the ground that are images of the eclipse.  10) If you have GOOD sunglasses wear your eclipse glasses OVER them. Your view will be the same and your protection will be greater.   There are no \"Do overs\". Don't dare someone or take a dare.

./gemma_tenedero_1-posts-2017.json:        "description": "A Spiritual Journey with Jesus, The Divine Mercy  added  4 new photos . The Healing Power of Gratitude  26 Oct 2017  The Lord has taught me a mystery about the healing power of gratitude. I pray that this reflection will bless you with inspiration and fill you with peace and joy.  In a hectic, fast paced world we don’t always “live in the moment”. “Living in the moment” is to me like quietly savoring the flavor of a fine wine. You need to enter into the experience with a gentle persistence that fills you with awareness and understanding.   When we live in the moment we are usually more aware of the blessings that surround us.  Let’s try to put this into practice right now.  Pause for a moment to consider that this opportunity for us to connect is enabled by technology. Let us give thanks for the opportunity that technology affords for communication, sharing, learning, entertainment, friendship and growth be it personal or professional. Hundreds of years ago it would not have been possible for us to connect like this, so let’s thank God for the innovation that technology allows for.  I personally believe that God is at the center of all that is beautiful and that all gratitude should be given to Him, the source of every blessing.  “Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.” James 1:17  If you believe that God is the source of all that is good, then know that there is an opportunity for each of us to see His divine fingerprints everywhere if we choose to look for them!  As we enter the end of October in many places in our world, God is recoloring the landscapes. The trees that were once green in color are now different shades of yellow, orange and red. I rejoice in nature and in its many different and wonderful manifestations. At night I often hear the howling of coyotes and wolves in the forest surrounding our house.  Our neighbour has placed motion-activated cameras in the woods, so I know we have a large bear back there too.  I have seen the photos and I would be so grateful Lord that he does not come too close to our house!  I don’t take our freedom, peace and security for granted. I am mindful that many people are living in conflict zones and they are listening to the sounds of guns and bombs, as they fear for their safety. Let’s be grateful for our freedom and peace and continue to pray for an end to war and violence.  I am of the opinion that an “attitude of gratitude” needs to be cultivated. For most of us it doesn’t come naturally. It literally needs to be sparked by a persistent focus on the many blessings in our life. If we choose to focus on “what’s missing” in our life, we will be insufficiently grateful for “what’s present” that is enriching our life in some way.  Pause throughout your day to say little prayers of thanks to God and watch how these prayers have a healing power on your life.  Watch how they spark joy and peace in your heart.  A number of years ago I introduced a prayer before our family meals, i.e.,  “The Prayer called Grace”. We always stop now before we eat to say thank you to God for our meal, our health, God’s love etc. Our prayer reflects whatever we are experiencing in that day and we try to remember to pray for those in need.  I believe true gratitude always motivates charity. If we are really grateful we will give back as a sign of our gratitude. For example as we give thanks for not being hungry, we should consider helping charities that offer assistance to the poor and needy.  “Those who give to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.” Proverbs 28:27  The Bible is a great source of joy to me. To reflect on God’s Holy Word is at the heart of my life. I am grateful that the Bible was translated into my native tongue, English. There were many people who fought for the translation of the Bible. I am grateful their advocacy and struggle and hard work gave us the opportunity to savour God’s Word as a light that leads us onto holy paths.  “Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.”  Psalm 119:105  I have had the privilege to sponsor some children in the developing world.  We pay for their school fees so they can go to school. I recall so many times as my own children were growing up they would chant “we don’t want to go to school!” but my sponsor children write to me about how grateful and how very, very happy they are to be able to learn and go to school.  Why is it that gratitude emerges so easily when we find something or someone we love is missing in our life?  We say “oh how grateful I would be to have them back!”  Suddenly we are so aware of a vacant space in our heart, a hole that longs to be filled.  As I was praying for God’s inspiration to help me with this reflection, I felt God saying to my heart that what’s most important is not so much “what to be thankful for”;  the most important thing is to learn “how to be thankful”. If we learn “how” to be thankful we will begin to notice that “what to be thankful for” is all around us!  It is God’s grace and Holy Spirit that teaches us to see the blessings in our life.  I believe that spiritual transformation is enabled by many moments of gratitude that illumine our hearts and minds with a realization and an appreciation of God’s providence. A life devoid of gratitude is to me like food without spices; that life is bland and tasteless. The Spirit of God is like a gently breeze, it is discerned by some and not felt by others.  Let us pray for the Holy Spirit of Gratitude, a Spirit that will awaken us to being truly thankful for the things and people and opportunities that enrich our life–all holy blessings from God.  One of the sacred experiences I treasure which I know is subject to some controversy is the Mass. Some people I know no longer go to Church because they feel that the sins of priests have caused Jesus to “exit” from the Sanctuary. Let’s reflect on the Word of God seeking truth and wisdom.  Before Jesus died He celebrated a sacred meal with His apostles, a meal commonly referred to as “The Last Supper”.  Jesus “took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.” Luke 22:19  Jesus said, “Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.” John 6:54-56  Following the Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, the Apostles did as Jesus requested and St. Paul warned them to be careful: “Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.” 1 Corinthians 11:29  In the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which we celebrate in the Mass, we must discern the Body of Christ or drink judgment on ourselves. The presence of Jesus in the Sacrament of Love is not a function of the sanctity of the Priest, it is the exclusive work of the Holy Spirit that transforms ordinary bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus.  When we receive Jesus in the Eucharist with faith and thanksgiving, we give praise and glory to God.  Sometimes my Catholic friends say that the “music” or the “homily” (i.e., priest’s sermon) “takes away” from their positive experience of the Mass. To this I would say, “let nothing get between you and Jesus”. Jesus waits for us in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. It is the Work of the Holy Spirit of God that gives us this blessing and let nothing and no one taint it with any form of disappointment!  Bride of Christ receive your Holy Lord and do this in remembrance of the Holy One, Jesus Christ, who gave everything up to create a place for you in Paradise and to destroy the power of sin in your life today!  With wonder, awe and reverence let us approach this miracle of love–Jesus in the Holy Eucharist.  Let us be grateful for this time we have on earth for it is an opportunity to show God how much we love Him. Let us not take anything for granted. Let’s give thanks for everything: the food that graces our tables, our shelter, our clothing, our water, our jobs, our health, our healthcare and so many natural remedies, the music and artistic expression that adds beauty to our world.  Let’s give thanks for our freedom, for peace in our life, for the friends and family that help us to grow in love. Let’s rejoice in the simple things—a moment to laugh, to smile, to learn, to pray, to give, to share, to forgive, to be forgiven, to love and to live in God’s presence, for Him, with Him and in Him.  Thank You for Your love Jesus! Thank You for the gift of faith. Thank You for being willing to die for us! Thank You for guiding me and teaching me and being willing to live in an intimate relationship with me. I savor this time with You as a foretaste of the heaven we will have forever. Please guide us to do Your Holy Will and to treat all the gifts around us as treasures of Your love.  I will stop every day Lord @ the Time you died for us, 3pm, to remember Your Passion and to pray for all souls, that all people will come to know you and love you.  This daily moment of thanksgiving fills my heart with holy desire to please You Jesus!  You are my heart’s desire.  Without You I am nothing!  Please join me friends of Jesus in a daily prayer for peace @ the time Jesus died for us, 3pm (each of us in our local time zones).

./164207252901-Anders_SaltinAndrea_Alonso.json:            "message": "\nSteve\nHello everyone! This is Steve, your friendly Vegas-trip provider :-)\nI do not have the contact information for every person going, so please pass this message along to those who have paid (and those not on Facebook).\n\nI wanted to write this to address some basic expectations about the trip to Las Vegas. If you have any additional concerns, please contact me through facebook or my nau email address: sa366@nau.edu\n\nFirst, we will be leaving from NAU at 4pm. Please be there no later than 4pm. My friend Ryan and I have reserved two rental vans and will be meeting everyone at the parking lot behind the library. Map: (parking lot P13 West of the library, building 28)\nhttp://sapphire.ucc.nau.edu/web/campus_map/north_campus.html\nI will try my best to have someone there at the parking lot with a sign. If you don't see that, look for two large white vans. We'll try to meet near the South part of the library, in between the library and the music building, but if we are not there, we will be somewhere in parking lot P13. We don't want to leave people behind, but if everyone is waiting and we cannot find you, we may leave.\n\nTRANSPORTATION EXPECTATIONS\n1) Do not bring too much, we do not have the capacity to take lots of luggage!\nWe are only going for 2 nights, so please pack light. Bring only one backpack (or two if absolutely necessary), as the vans only have that much space for luggage. If you have a costume for Halloween, try to make it as compact as possible. We also have two cars along with the two vans, but they have people and luggage too. We will do everything we can to fit everyone and all luggage in all the vehicles, but if something doesn't fit, someone will need to put their luggage back in their room, and if this happens it delays the trip for everyone.\nThings to bring: clothes, a towel, soap/shampoo, alcohol, money (bring more than you think you need, Vegas is expensive even if you do not gamble - I think about $200-$300 is good).\nDo not bring: hair dryers, loud music players, more luggage than necessary.\n\n2) Hoover Dam: I heard some people would like to stop at the dam - it may be possible to stop on the way there or returning from Vegas. I think this can work, but I will discuss the potential problems on the way there, and we can make a group decision as to what to do.\n\n3) Security Checkpoint: we will pass a security checkpoint near the Nevada border. This is no cause for alarm, and most of the time cars will get waved through without stopping. Our vans may be stopped for a quick inspection, but since we will be doing nothing illegal in the car (like drinking) we will not have a problem.\n\n4) It would be good to stop as little as possible on the trip. We can go to Vegas without stopping for gas, so please go to the bathroom before we depart. Also, please bring some snacks for the ride.\n\n\nROOM EXPECTATIONS\n1) First and most importantly, we want to avoid security coming to the room. There is a risk that, if security finds out, we will be fined an extra fee per person in the room. However, I want to stress that this is NOT A PROBLEM if we are quiet. Of course its okay to hang out a little bit in the room, and use it to get ready and things like that, but I think you'll be wanting to spend most of your time outside the room anyway.\n\n2) On arrival, a few people (including myself) will check in, and go up to the rooms. We will get duplicate room keys and will distribute these among the group so that everyone may go up and put their stuff in the room. We just need to be careful because a group of 30 people going to two rooms looks suspicious. Again, this is not a problem, but is just the most complicated part of the trip. Ryan and I will explain the details on the drive there and answer any questions. I estimate we will all be ready by about 10pm or 11pm on Friday.\n\n3) Once we arrive and have checked in, and after everyone has a key: have fun! There are plenty of websites describing what to do in Vegas, so have a look and get a general idea. The MGM Grand is at the South of the Strip, so most things will be North. It is possible to travel short distances on foot, but if you want to go to the North end of the Strip you may want to consider a cab ride. I plan on going to old Las Vegas, now called the Fremont Experience, which is too far from the MGM to walk. Gambling is cheaper there and they have a cool overhead light show.\n\n4) Check out at the hotel is Sunday at 11am. We need to be out by that time and on our way back. The rental vans are due back in Flagstaff at 4pm, so we will appreciate it if everyone is prompt.\n\n\nThank you very much for helping us make this trip! If you have any questions or concerns, please message me on facebook or email me at sa366@nau.edu\nse message me on facebook or email me at sa366@nau.edu\n\n\nList of all going (everyone who has paid):\nAnne\nSteve\nElyse\nJared\nRyan\nTaryn\nJanelle\nBrian\nJessie\nAubrey\nAbby\nSally\nBruce\nMike\nDanielle Seager\nAurianne S\nKim Norraeus\nAnders Saltin\nSylvia\nJudith Aboulker\nSandra Peterson\nAndrea Alonso\nIngrid Hofstra\nRob Langeland\nJan Peder Nilsen\nLola Domingez\nHan Verberne\nHaruna/Eiko Shimojo\nYulia Goncharvia\nAi Odoriba\nMarjan Nugteren\nMakoto Yamauchi\nKsenia Karakozova\nZhikun Xu\nMarlyn S\nNidar Tchezoff\nNorth Campus NAU\nsapphire.ucc.nau.edu\n"
