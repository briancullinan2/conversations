Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Group Conversation 8503): Mon Jul 16 18:28:10 2007
[07/16/2007 06:28:10 PM] Alex Markov: lets get brian's input on this
[07/16/2007 06:28:14 PM] Alex Markov: brian are you here
[07/16/2007 06:28:35 PM] Robert Douglas: are u working on any other pages?
[07/16/2007 06:28:42 PM] Alex Markov: i want to finish our consulting pages
[07/16/2007 06:28:50 PM] Robert Douglas: just work on tech consulting page for now
[07/16/2007 06:28:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[07/16/2007 06:29:05 PM] Alex Markov: brian i am sending u an overview of all our consulting services divided
[07/16/2007 06:29:13 PM] Alex Markov: accept it
[07/16/2007 06:29:22 PM] Alex Markov: this is our dispute
[07/16/2007 06:29:47 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not disputing anything until we finish our text first
[07/16/2007 06:29:55 PM] Alex Markov: Robert thinks that we should just have 1 service called tech consulting
[07/16/2007 06:29:56 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not gunna let arguments waste our time alex, we gotta finish the text and argue later
[07/16/2007 06:29:56 PM] Alex Markov: but that service encompases SOOO much and the text for it will be massive
[07/16/2007 06:30:06 PM] Alex Markov: so i divided it into several services
[07/16/2007 06:30:30 PM] Alex Markov: human resource consulting we can take out for now
[07/16/2007 06:30:44 PM] Robert Douglas: alex, plz, let's finish this text and argue later
[07/16/2007 06:30:46 PM] Alex Markov: however...all the other ones are specialized tech consulting that each have about a paragraph or two of text
[07/16/2007 06:31:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think there should be multiple categories of consulting, we want to appeal to all types of needs of a company, if we only specify that we do tech consulting they are going to have more questions about what we CAN do then what we list
[07/16/2007 06:32:25 PM] Alex Markov: my issue is that if i write down ALL that we do under tech consulting.... it will be like an endless scroll
[07/16/2007 06:33:48 PM] Alex Markov: Robert, what do u think. i dont think we should put all that info under one page. that is a TON of info
[07/16/2007 06:34:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the document should be kept the size it is, and as we provide more services we will break off more information on each topic
[07/16/2007 06:34:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: but so far the document looks great the way it is
[07/16/2007 06:34:44 PM] Alex Markov: no this is just the overview. each one of those will have its own page
[07/16/2007 06:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[07/16/2007 06:35:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: when are we going to write all those new pages?
[07/16/2007 06:35:13 PM] Alex Markov: i have most of it written uo
[07/16/2007 06:35:15 PM] Alex Markov: up
[07/16/2007 06:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: so then what is the conflict?
[07/16/2007 06:35:41 PM] Alex Markov: robert thinks we should not include it now and do it a while later and jsut compile it into all one page. tehc consulting
[07/16/2007 06:35:50 PM] Alex Markov: i tink we should take the little time to jsut make the separate pages now
[07/16/2007 06:36:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you mean divide up the page you have written up for only the technology consulting page
[07/16/2007 06:36:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[07/16/2007 06:37:09 PM] Alex Markov: they are already divided. bobby wants to put them all into one big page
[07/16/2007 06:37:22 PM] Alex Markov: which will be REALLY long
[07/16/2007 06:37:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would say keep them seperate because they are going on a website
[07/16/2007 06:38:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: if they were bring printed out or sent to a client it should be in one long pdf with a proper table of contents
[07/16/2007 06:38:44 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[07/16/2007 06:38:52 PM] Alex Markov: im gonna finished the individual pages and send them over robert
[07/16/2007 06:39:39 PM] Robert Douglas: work ont he other pages  first
[07/16/2007 06:40:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: what other pages need to be worked on?
[07/16/2007 06:40:09 PM] Alex Markov: if i am half finished with them already im jsut gonna finish them up

[07/16/2007 06:40:58 PM] Alex Markov: and for business solutions... we jsut gotta take sugar's marketing info in the partner portal
[07/16/2007 06:41:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: categorize them as much as possible
