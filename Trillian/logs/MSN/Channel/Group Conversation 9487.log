Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Group Conversation 9487): Mon Jun 11 13:33:37 2007
[06/11/2007 01:33:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you just setup up the config in multiple places, you don't need to actually install svnserve 2 different times
[06/11/2007 01:34:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will set that up when you get me passwords?
[06/11/2007 01:34:21 PM] Robert Douglas: but what happens when you switch boxes?
[06/11/2007 01:34:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: just install svnserve on the new box and copy over the files
[06/11/2007 01:35:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want it setup like that, i want it separate
[06/11/2007 01:35:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: well it will be seperate
[06/11/2007 01:35:37 PM] Robert Douglas: no, it will use the SAME install, with 2 configs
[06/11/2007 01:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: svnserve is a tool in the OS, like bash or convert for image magick
[06/11/2007 01:35:46 PM] Robert Douglas: meaning we cant move it over to another box
[06/11/2007 01:36:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok robert you do what ever you think you need to
[06/11/2007 01:36:15 PM] Robert Douglas: if you think otherwsie, convince me so you dont waste your time on something that isn't useful
[06/11/2007 01:36:22 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why we're discussing this
[06/11/2007 01:36:23 PM] Alex Markov: brian we just want what is ebst for all of us
[06/11/2007 01:36:34 PM] Alex Markov: robert believes that separate isntalls would be better. why do u disagree
[06/11/2007 01:36:35 PM] Robert Douglas: u have to be prepared for a dicussion/suggestions
[06/11/2007 01:36:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have to convice anyone of anything, i know how svnserve works, so you just get me a username and password for the accounts and THEN we can move on
[06/11/2007 01:37:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: svnserve is already installed, i just need accounts created
[06/11/2007 01:37:29 PM] Alex Markov: that is the wrong attitude brian. if i want to do a major thing in the company i should convince you guys
[06/11/2007 01:37:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't install to a specific account, but i know that
[06/11/2007 01:37:58 PM] Alex Markov: does bobby mke apoint that 2 separate installs would be best?
[06/11/2007 01:38:08 PM] Robert Douglas: sec, phone
[06/11/2007 01:38:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok thats not the point, tell the admins you want to new accounts
[06/11/2007 01:39:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't install to a specific account, it is just a tool for hosting, so create accounts to put the data then use svnadmin to install and create all the config files
[06/11/2007 01:39:34 PM] Robert Douglas: ok basck
[06/11/2007 01:39:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't install to a specific account, it is just a tool for hosting, so create accounts to put the data then use svnadmin to install and create all the config files
[06/11/2007 01:39:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats it
[06/11/2007 01:39:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: just do it
[06/11/2007 01:40:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is nothing to argue because thats the way it is done
[06/11/2007 01:40:17 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not arguing, we're talking about the setup
[06/11/2007 01:40:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: so do the next steps and create the accounts we already discussed
[06/11/2007 01:40:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so lets move on to file structure
[06/11/2007 01:40:51 PM] Robert Douglas: sec, phone
[06/11/2007 01:41:10 PM] Alex Markov: yes we are not argeuing we are discussing. 
[06/11/2007 01:41:14 PM] Alex Markov: ill come up with the file structure
[06/11/2007 01:41:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/11/2007 01:42:02 PM] Robert Douglas: stop talking please
[06/11/2007 01:42:03 PM] Robert Douglas: hang on for me
[06/11/2007 01:42:18 PM] Alex Markov: ok we will hold
[06/11/2007 01:47:13 PM] Robert Douglas: ok back
[06/11/2007 01:48:07 PM] Robert Douglas: brian, each of the two SVN locations, will not require each other to function, correct?
[06/11/2007 01:48:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: correct
[06/11/2007 01:48:21 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, you wont have a single source to manage the svn, instead, they will be completely independant
[06/11/2007 01:48:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes completely independent
[06/11/2007 01:49:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: they just both happen to use the same tool, just like we can use convert on different websites for images, svnserve and svnadmin are just a tool
[06/11/2007 01:49:53 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, and that tool is something that is already installed on the server level, or something that you have to install, and it will work for all SVNs
[06/11/2007 01:50:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/11/2007 01:50:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: its already install, i just need accounts
[06/11/2007 01:50:38 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, sounds like we're on the same pag enow
[06/11/2007 01:50:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have access to pmxp on here, but i can create the accounts right now if you dont mind putting them inside pmxp, else you'll have to wait until tonight
[06/11/2007 01:51:11 PM] Robert Douglas: alex, do u have any questions before we move further?
[06/11/2007 01:51:17 PM] Alex Markov: no i think its a go
[06/11/2007 01:51:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can put them in pmxp
