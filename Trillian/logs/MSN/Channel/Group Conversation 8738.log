Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Group Conversation 8738): Mon May 21 09:55:34 2007
[05/21/2007 09:55:34 AM] Robert Douglas: wow
[05/21/2007 09:55:48 AM] Alex Markov: everoyne pay attention
[05/21/2007 09:56:08 AM] Alex Markov: this is a whole new position in the company
[05/21/2007 09:56:19 AM] Alex Markov: the is the biggest change to the company in a long time
[05/21/2007 09:56:35 AM] Alex Markov: it is a MASSIVE fundamental change in the company
[05/21/2007 09:57:12 AM] Robert Douglas: and...?
[05/21/2007 09:57:30 AM] Alex Markov: the BM is in charge of delegating intenral projects
[05/21/2007 09:57:40 AM] Alex Markov: if anyone has an issue about this. they must discuss with bm
[05/21/2007 09:57:45 AM] Alex Markov: for now it will be me. in the future it will someone else
[05/21/2007 09:57:48 AM] Robert Douglas: i think we should stick with the partners
[05/21/2007 09:57:49 AM] Robert Douglas: for now
[05/21/2007 09:57:55 AM] Alex Markov: now we need a bm
[05/21/2007 09:57:57 AM] Robert Douglas: then hire someone as an official title later
[05/21/2007 09:57:58 AM] Alex Markov: everyone i talked too
[05/21/2007 09:58:00 AM] Alex Markov: paul
[05/21/2007 09:58:03 AM] Alex Markov: richard botnick
[05/21/2007 09:58:05 AM] Alex Markov: all tell me i need one
[05/21/2007 09:58:11 AM] Alex Markov: in the web design kit the guys says we need one
[05/21/2007 09:58:28 AM] Alex Markov: stop argueing with me and jsut accept it please. 
[05/21/2007 09:58:30 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm not arguing that, just saying the way everything is setup, we cant have just 1 person be a BM
[05/21/2007 09:58:43 AM] Alex Markov: here is the example
[05/21/2007 09:58:46 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/21/2007 09:58:57 AM] Alex Markov: the BM just gave brain the DM Project
[05/21/2007 09:58:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: This is a very simple concept, Robert, you are correct, you and Alex are partners and should both make important decisions.  However, there are daily tasks and decisions to be made every day, you can't have a 20 minute conversation every time something needs to change, this is where there should be a Business Manager.  To make the every day decisions, thats it.  Period, nothing else matters.
[05/21/2007 09:59:18 AM] Alex Markov: when the deadline is set
[05/21/2007 09:59:23 AM] Robert Douglas: that's how it currently works brian
[05/21/2007 09:59:26 AM] Alex Markov: it is the BMs job alone to track the progress of that project
[05/21/2007 09:59:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so then there should be any problem and we can stop discussing this
[05/21/2007 09:59:41 AM] Alex Markov: u... bobby... as a senior partner.... need not worry
[05/21/2007 09:59:52 AM] Robert Douglas: so the BM just makes sure the internal projects are being done?
[05/21/2007 10:00:22 AM] Alex Markov: no. much more. The BM will set sstaff meetings. all issues that need to be discussed... will be presented to the BM and he must organize the staff meeting according to everyone;'s  schedules
[05/21/2007 10:00:28 AM] Alex Markov: he also delegates intenral projects
[05/21/2007 10:00:39 AM] Alex Markov: the BM will keep track of everyone;'s schedule
[05/21/2007 10:00:40 AM] Robert Douglas: well, that's what i'll be doing too though, so that makes me a BM?
[05/21/2007 10:00:53 AM] Alex Markov: no. u do not need to do that anymore
[05/21/2007 10:01:02 AM] Alex Markov: if you see that the BM is not doing a good job
[05/21/2007 10:01:04 AM] Robert Douglas: but i want to know how things are going
[05/21/2007 10:01:09 AM] Alex Markov: thenu must bringu up specific examples
[05/21/2007 10:01:16 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm always going to want to see that information
[05/21/2007 10:01:29 AM] Alex Markov: the BM is repsonbile of providing status reports to everyone about currnent projects
[05/21/2007 10:01:41 AM] Robert Douglas: do this alex
[05/21/2007 10:01:48 AM] Robert Douglas: writeup a list of shit the BM does
[05/21/2007 10:01:49 AM] Alex Markov: so u, and all partners, and all major players in the company will be updated by the BM
[05/21/2007 10:01:55 AM] Robert Douglas: then come back later and talk about it
[05/21/2007 10:02:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thank god
[05/21/2007 10:02:03 AM] Alex Markov: ok
[05/21/2007 10:02:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats the best idea i've heard so far
[05/21/2007 10:02:06 AM] Robert Douglas: u need to plan it out
[05/21/2007 10:02:11 AM] Alex Markov: agreed
[05/21/2007 10:02:11 AM] Robert Douglas: explain it in detail what happens
[05/21/2007 10:02:13 AM] Robert Douglas: when it happens
[05/21/2007 10:02:17 AM] Robert Douglas: then present your case
[05/21/2007 10:02:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and not argue about it in a convo
[05/21/2007 10:02:23 AM] Alex Markov: this is only an idea i had this weekend after talking to richard botnick and paul
[05/21/2007 10:02:26 AM] Robert Douglas: look at the shit brian wrote up in the document protocol
[05/21/2007 10:02:32 AM] Robert Douglas: that shit is detailed as fuck
[05/21/2007 10:02:44 AM] Alex Markov: sec. we are going in order of meeting
[05/21/2007 10:02:52 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/21/2007 10:02:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: next is document management
[05/21/2007 10:02:54 AM] Alex Markov: everyone settle down. we have only been at this for less than an hour
[05/21/2007 10:02:57 AM] Alex Markov: next is website
[05/21/2007 10:03:00 AM] Alex Markov: we will go voer it briefly
[05/21/2007 10:03:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: k
[05/21/2007 10:03:38 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=103&page=2)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=103&page=2
[05/21/2007 10:03:55 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=16&d=1179495642)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=16&d=1179495642
[05/21/2007 10:04:15 AM] Alex Markov: i jsut forwarded you both ryan's RPS mock ups
[05/21/2007 10:04:26 AM] Alex Markov: it is an email
[05/21/2007 10:04:29 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/21/2007 10:04:30 AM] Alex Markov: it should be in your inbox now
[05/21/2007 10:04:37 AM] Robert Douglas: hopefully with a fucking message
[05/21/2007 10:04:40 AM] Alex Markov: i want you all to open it
[05/21/2007 10:04:46 AM] Alex Markov: no. i am telling u the message in here.
[05/21/2007 10:04:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think the template looks absolutely excellent
[05/21/2007 10:05:11 AM] Robert Douglas: upload the images, or send it to bobbydouglas@cox.net instead
[05/21/2007 10:05:19 AM] Robert Douglas: becauase robert.douglas stores all the shit inside an online DB
[05/21/2007 10:05:27 AM] Robert Douglas: and your bullshit emails waste space
[05/21/2007 10:05:32 AM] Robert Douglas: i told u this already
[05/21/2007 10:06:17 AM] Robert Douglas: k nvm
[05/21/2007 10:06:22 AM] Robert Douglas: waiting for email to come in
[05/21/2007 10:06:26 AM] Alex Markov: tell me when u both open ryan's mockups
[05/21/2007 10:07:04 AM] Robert Douglas: got them
[05/21/2007 10:07:15 AM] Robert Douglas: ryan isnt a template designer
[05/21/2007 10:07:35 AM] Robert Douglas: although his login button looks hot
[05/21/2007 10:07:36 AM] Robert Douglas: for client login
[05/21/2007 10:07:41 AM] Alex Markov: well i agree
[05/21/2007 10:07:50 AM] Robert Douglas: helen will do a b etter job
[05/21/2007 10:08:01 AM] Alex Markov: but we need too take good ideas from him and get helen to use them
[05/21/2007 10:08:07 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/21/2007 10:08:07 AM] Alex Markov: so lets all look at ryan's mock ups
[05/21/2007 10:08:08 AM] Robert Douglas: so bad
[05/21/2007 10:08:19 AM] Robert Douglas: we basically need to use less red, like u said for the template
[05/21/2007 10:08:49 AM] Alex Markov: as pre facto BM i am making a general order. negative criticism should never be uttered. because it is not nice. if it ever got back to ryan it would destroy a relationship
[05/21/2007 10:08:56 AM] Alex Markov: we all know whats what. no need to say it
[05/21/2007 10:09:15 AM] Robert Douglas: in a sense yes and no
[05/21/2007 10:09:23 AM] Robert Douglas: negative is the best kind to have when trying to build something
[05/21/2007 10:09:37 AM] Robert Douglas: with helen, you want to go over the negative shit
[05/21/2007 10:09:38 AM] Alex Markov: there is a difference between negative and mean
[05/21/2007 10:09:47 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:09:50 AM] Alex Markov: moving on
[05/21/2007 10:10:04 AM] Robert Douglas: brian isnt here
[05/21/2007 10:10:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i concur
[05/21/2007 10:10:09 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/21/2007 10:10:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am here
[05/21/2007 10:10:12 AM] Alex Markov: :)
[05/21/2007 10:10:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: with the overuse of red
[05/21/2007 10:10:22 AM] Alex Markov: ok what do u guys like about mock up 1
[05/21/2007 10:10:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i commented on it earlier in the week to Alex
[05/21/2007 10:10:47 AM] Robert Douglas: what is mockup 1?
[05/21/2007 10:10:50 AM] Robert Douglas: u mean rps1.gif?
[05/21/2007 10:10:51 AM] Alex Markov: i think ryan's main navigation has something too it
[05/21/2007 10:10:52 AM] Alex Markov: its easier to see
[05/21/2007 10:10:55 AM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/21/2007 10:10:56 AM] Alex Markov: rps1
[05/21/2007 10:11:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am confused
[05/21/2007 10:11:16 AM] Robert Douglas: i dont like any of it
[05/21/2007 10:11:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is that the website?
[05/21/2007 10:11:27 AM] Alex Markov: ok briefly ill fill u in
[05/21/2007 10:11:30 AM] Robert Douglas: it simply looks unprofessional
[05/21/2007 10:11:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i thought the one in the forum was the website
[05/21/2007 10:11:39 AM] Alex Markov: one of our programmers... has been giving us feedback on helen's new rps template
[05/21/2007 10:11:40 AM] Robert Douglas: the only thing i like is the login button
[05/21/2007 10:11:52 AM] Alex Markov: so he offered to provide free mockups for idea sake 
[05/21/2007 10:12:11 AM] Alex Markov: rps1.gif and rps2.gif are his free mockups
[05/21/2007 10:12:13 AM] Robert Douglas: i think ryan's mockups won't be used
[05/21/2007 10:12:17 AM] Alex Markov: i agree
[05/21/2007 10:12:21 AM] Alex Markov: but ideas from it should be
[05/21/2007 10:12:24 AM] Alex Markov: the case study area
[05/21/2007 10:12:25 AM] Robert Douglas: i see nothing to benefit us
[05/21/2007 10:12:32 AM] Alex Markov: i rly like that
[05/21/2007 10:12:36 AM] Robert Douglas: we already have that
[05/21/2007 10:12:38 AM] Alex Markov: case study should not be in a box on the left
[05/21/2007 10:12:56 AM] Alex Markov: or should it be?
[05/21/2007 10:12:56 AM] Robert Douglas: this is the TEMPLATE
[05/21/2007 10:12:56 AM] Robert Douglas: we dont give a shit about content
[05/21/2007 10:13:05 AM] Alex Markov: fine
[05/21/2007 10:13:05 AM] Robert Douglas: we're looking for layout (columns) and colors
[05/21/2007 10:13:22 AM] Robert Douglas: we can use the template to make case studies
[05/21/2007 10:13:31 AM] Robert Douglas: or make a why use rps thing
[05/21/2007 10:13:47 AM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt matter at this stage, we'll talk about it AFTER the template is done
[05/21/2007 10:13:52 AM] Alex Markov: fine. so from rps1 we only like the login button correct?
[05/21/2007 10:13:56 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:14:00 AM] Alex Markov: ok open rps2
[05/21/2007 10:14:11 AM] Robert Douglas: i like the greys in RPS2
[05/21/2007 10:14:15 AM] Robert Douglas: that's about it
[05/21/2007 10:14:22 AM] Robert Douglas: the grey headers for each section look good
[05/21/2007 10:14:23 AM] Alex Markov: i think ryan is onto something with that tree image
[05/21/2007 10:14:30 AM] Alex Markov: what if instead of a big technological banner
[05/21/2007 10:14:38 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:14:41 AM] Alex Markov: we have like a big greeen pasture with words above it
[05/21/2007 10:14:46 AM] Robert Douglas: that is a good idea
[05/21/2007 10:14:49 AM] Alex Markov: like "RPS will make your future bright"
[05/21/2007 10:15:01 AM] Alex Markov: it will break up the red
[05/21/2007 10:15:13 AM] Alex Markov: itwill be really crisp and clean looking
[05/21/2007 10:15:14 AM] Robert Douglas: and add a very crisp color
[05/21/2007 10:15:16 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:15:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anyways, my two cents, i like them both, and here is why.  The template in the forum is a little too bright and almost too active that it looks cluttered, these two in mockup 1 are a lot simpler, they have a bolder layout, but the boldness comes off as a little plain because of the last of flashy graphics, so personally i think we need to find a happy medium between to two, we should figure out which designer we like better and have them make the changes to even out the two different templates
[05/21/2007 10:15:49 AM] Alex Markov: well we paid helen already so she is gonna do it
[05/21/2007 10:15:53 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *last was supposed to be lack
[05/21/2007 10:16:01 AM] Alex Markov: we jsut need to figureout what the PM of the RPS website will need to do
[05/21/2007 10:16:05 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/settings/seasons/spring/2807634_panoramic_summer_fields.php?id=2807634)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/settings/seasons/spring/2807634_panoramic_summer_fields.php?id=2807634
[05/21/2007 10:16:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then helen could help us find the medium
[05/21/2007 10:16:21 AM] Robert Douglas: "Let RPS lead you down to the path of technology"
[05/21/2007 10:16:23 AM] Alex Markov: bobby is the new PM of the RPS website. all comments to helen must go through him
[05/21/2007 10:16:36 AM] Alex Markov: ooooooooooooo
[05/21/2007 10:16:38 AM] Alex Markov: i like it
[05/21/2007 10:17:08 AM] Robert Douglas: dunno if it is wide enough to fit though
[05/21/2007 10:17:08 AM] Robert Douglas: :/
[05/21/2007 10:17:21 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761
[05/21/2007 10:19:09 AM] Alex Markov: i think the red technological banner is too messy. and it adds too much red to the site. so now our job is to find the right banner. preferably a summer meadow type picture
[05/21/2007 10:19:19 AM] Robert Douglas: sec
[05/21/2007 10:19:29 AM] Robert Douglas: ww.rp-s.com/dual-images.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:19:32 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/dual-images.jpg)www.rp-s.com/dual-images.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:19:38 AM] Robert Douglas: we will need to have 2 images
[05/21/2007 10:19:59 AM] Robert Douglas: so mayube one imagewill be a pasture, and another will be some sort of technology thing
[05/21/2007 10:20:08 AM] Alex Markov: nono i dont like it
[05/21/2007 10:20:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i like the way ryan laid out the colors better, no color is used TOO much
[05/21/2007 10:20:15 AM] Alex Markov: thats even more cluttered
[05/21/2007 10:20:24 AM] Robert Douglas: well, we will use another image that will work
[05/21/2007 10:20:26 AM] Alex Markov: well ryan;s whole left side is bright red. thats no good
[05/21/2007 10:20:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not in the first image
[05/21/2007 10:20:56 AM] Alex Markov: true
[05/21/2007 10:21:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but yes, in the second image the red is too prominent 
[05/21/2007 10:21:23 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/another-idea.jpg)www.rp-s.com/another-idea.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:21:26 AM] Robert Douglas: that's the only other option
[05/21/2007 10:21:52 AM] Robert Douglas: it is just a flipped version of the other picture
[05/21/2007 10:22:11 AM] Robert Douglas: unless we can find an image wide enough, we're gunn ahave to do that
[05/21/2007 10:22:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that is an excellent idea bobby, having the trees in the banner gives it an accent and really clears out the red being to active
[05/21/2007 10:22:50 AM] Robert Douglas: we need something 980px wide or greater in order to fit
[05/21/2007 10:22:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am sure we can find an image wide enough, look at art websites
[05/21/2007 10:23:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: under scapes
[05/21/2007 10:23:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like deviantart.com or artuproar.com
[05/21/2007 10:23:53 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that field scape really looks great though
[05/21/2007 10:24:13 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to find them on a place that allows us to use the image
[05/21/2007 10:24:20 AM] Robert Douglas: like istockphoto
[05/21/2007 10:24:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can contact the author
[05/21/2007 10:24:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have done it before
[05/21/2007 10:24:32 AM] Alex Markov: why cant we just take that image and lessen the height of it
[05/21/2007 10:24:54 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/settings/seasons/spring/2807634_panoramic_summer_fields.php?id=2807634)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/settings/seasons/spring/2807634_panoramic_summer_fields.php?id=2807634 that small image is 1177px in width
[05/21/2007 10:24:57 AM] Alex Markov: and 408 in height
[05/21/2007 10:25:03 AM] Alex Markov: what if we only show like 200 of the height
[05/21/2007 10:25:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:25:20 AM] Robert Douglas: we cna do that too
[05/21/2007 10:25:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then it might fit the ratio better, but the quality will go down from streching it
[05/21/2007 10:25:41 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761
[05/21/2007 10:25:45 AM] Alex Markov: no. istock has rly good high quality large images
[05/21/2007 10:25:46 AM] Robert Douglas: i like this one better
[05/21/2007 10:25:59 AM] Robert Douglas: 1306 x 368 px 
[05/21/2007 10:26:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks good
[05/21/2007 10:26:26 AM] Robert Douglas: agree alex?
[05/21/2007 10:28:00 AM] Alex Markov: i just tried to make it work and it is difficult
[05/21/2007 10:28:14 AM] Alex Markov: we need something with more blue sky and less cluds
[05/21/2007 10:28:17 AM] Alex Markov: clouds
[05/21/2007 10:28:22 AM] Alex Markov: we will look int it later
[05/21/2007 10:28:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that green field really fixed the red being too dominant
[05/21/2007 10:28:55 AM] Alex Markov: bobby. after the meeting. u need to get all our comments... and submit them to helen
[05/21/2007 10:29:18 AM] Alex Markov: what do u guys think about the big red headers for the boxes
[05/21/2007 10:29:20 AM] Alex Markov: i dont like that
[05/21/2007 10:29:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and red and green are complimentary colors
[05/21/2007 10:29:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: on the left and right?
[05/21/2007 10:30:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think they could be grey glossy like they are now just grey instead, like in ryan's mockups
[05/21/2007 10:30:18 AM] Alex Markov: 'search' 'why rps box' ' member login
[05/21/2007 10:30:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i do like the red and would hate to see them all be replace, then we might be at a lack of red
[05/21/2007 10:30:44 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=13&d=1179335811)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=13&d=1179335811
[05/21/2007 10:30:51 AM] Alex Markov: i rly liked how helen had it before
[05/21/2007 10:31:03 AM] Alex Markov: simple grey
[05/21/2007 10:31:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agreed
[05/21/2007 10:31:16 AM] Alex Markov: look at RPS Mission
[05/21/2007 10:31:17 AM] Alex Markov: the RPS is red
[05/21/2007 10:31:20 AM] Alex Markov: and mission is vgrey
[05/21/2007 10:31:23 AM] Alex Markov: that is hot
[05/21/2007 10:31:27 AM] Alex Markov: bobby, do u concur?
[05/21/2007 10:31:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i like the second one better
[05/21/2007 10:31:48 AM] Robert Douglas: i like the red/grey
[05/21/2007 10:31:59 AM] Alex Markov: those red header things are too bright and big
[05/21/2007 10:32:08 AM] Robert Douglas: i agree
[05/21/2007 10:32:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:32:35 AM] Alex Markov: bobby make sur eu are taking notes into a notefile
[05/21/2007 10:32:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that with the green field would be excellent
[05/21/2007 10:32:41 AM] Alex Markov: into a textfile
[05/21/2007 10:32:58 AM] Robert Douglas: so far, we need to use less red
[05/21/2007 10:33:00 AM] Alex Markov: we need to get her to make those back to the red/grey
[05/21/2007 10:33:02 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe change around the headers
[05/21/2007 10:33:09 AM] Robert Douglas: and then add a green pasture image
[05/21/2007 10:33:11 AM] Alex Markov: and add a new banner 
[05/21/2007 10:33:24 AM] Alex Markov: well make sure u have them written down now so u dont spend time going back in the convo
[05/21/2007 10:33:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the red links and the Free Consultation i think those are important reds
[05/21/2007 10:33:40 AM] Alex Markov: login image form ryan too
[05/21/2007 10:33:53 AM] Alex Markov: the free consultationb utton is simply beautiful
[05/21/2007 10:33:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes definitely
[05/21/2007 10:34:02 AM] Alex Markov: i would marry it if i could marry a digital button
[05/21/2007 10:34:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the red links in the middle of the page
[05/21/2007 10:34:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all those Reasons
[05/21/2007 10:34:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: those are nice accents
[05/21/2007 10:34:25 AM] Alex Markov: yeah helen's reasons links are gotness
[05/21/2007 10:35:11 AM] Alex Markov: ok bobby. do u...as the new PM of the iWD project feel we are finished with the discussion?
[05/21/2007 10:35:33 AM] Robert Douglas: i think the text size is too small
[05/21/2007 10:35:34 AM] Alex Markov: all internal projects will have i in front of them. per the new BM's request
[05/21/2007 10:35:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2007 10:35:51 AM] Alex Markov: rps web design project= iWD
[05/21/2007 10:35:53 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: apple

[05/21/2007 10:36:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can we make is I-AR
[05/21/2007 10:36:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: please?
[05/21/2007 10:36:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i hate appple
[05/21/2007 10:36:36 AM] Alex Markov: apple can suck my left nut. we will take them over in less than 20 years
[05/21/2007 10:36:37 AM] Robert Douglas: lol sounds like a retard
[05/21/2007 10:36:39 AM] Robert Douglas: I-AR
[05/21/2007 10:36:43 AM] Robert Douglas: I-AM
[05/21/2007 10:36:50 AM] Alex Markov: dash is somewhat annouying to type
[05/21/2007 10:36:55 AM] Alex Markov: i-ar
[05/21/2007 10:36:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm ok, not important
[05/21/2007 10:37:06 AM] Alex Markov: ok we can do dash i guess
[05/21/2007 10:37:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good call on the convention though alex
[05/21/2007 10:37:10 AM] Robert Douglas: what image
[05/21/2007 10:37:10 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/scenics/exploration/landscapes/3151761_green_field_landscape_country_road.php?id=3151761
[05/21/2007 10:37:11 AM] Alex Markov: i.ar
[05/21/2007 10:37:14 AM] Robert Douglas: is this the one we agree on?
[05/21/2007 10:37:24 AM] Alex Markov: no too many clouds
[05/21/2007 10:37:30 AM] Robert Douglas: cloulds look good though
[05/21/2007 10:37:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i like the clouds
[05/21/2007 10:37:53 AM] Alex Markov: we want a clear blue sky. clouds are turbulent
[05/21/2007 10:37:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[05/21/2007 10:37:59 AM] Alex Markov: some clouds
[05/21/2007 10:38:12 AM] Alex Markov: but when we cut off that top part... its gonna be all clouds
[05/21/2007 10:38:20 AM] Alex Markov: i justtried it in photoshop
[05/21/2007 10:39:01 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/clouds.jpg)www.rp-s.com/clouds.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:39:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/3382822_green_field_landscape.php?id=3382822)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/3382822_green_field_landscape.php?id=3382822
[05/21/2007 10:39:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: kind of like the road though
[05/21/2007 10:39:42 AM] Alex Markov: i like the lone tree concept but it may make client feel they are alone
[05/21/2007 10:39:46 AM] Robert Douglas: the road wont work
[05/21/2007 10:39:47 AM] Alex Markov: the road is good imagry
[05/21/2007 10:39:54 AM] Robert Douglas: because we are cutting it down so much
[05/21/2007 10:40:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah so maybe the tree isn't such a bad idea
[05/21/2007 10:40:24 AM] Robert Douglas: but i like the text for "Let RPS lead you down the road of technology"
[05/21/2007 10:40:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:40:42 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/2931084_green_field_landscape_panorama.php?id=2931084)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/2931084_green_field_landscape_panorama.php?id=2931084
[05/21/2007 10:40:45 AM] Alex Markov: something along those lines yes
[05/21/2007 10:40:49 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/2568218_green_field_and_lonely_tree_landscape.php?id=2568218)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup/business/agriculture_farming/fields/2568218_green_field_and_lonely_tree_landscape.php?id=2568218
[05/21/2007 10:41:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have to say i like the lone tree
[05/21/2007 10:41:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i like the slogan too
[05/21/2007 10:41:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup.php?id=3386118)http://www.istockphoto.com/file_closeup.php?id=3386118
[05/21/2007 10:41:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: kind of cool with that slogan
[05/21/2007 10:42:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not sure how well that would fit into the template with the brown
[05/21/2007 10:42:31 AM] Alex Markov: i dont like road of technology
[05/21/2007 10:42:40 AM] Alex Markov: we are so much more thant a technology company
[05/21/2007 10:42:47 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/header1.jpg)www.rp-s.com/header1.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:42:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then we should go with the lone tree and think up a catchy slogan later
[05/21/2007 10:43:03 AM] Alex Markov: we are officially a "Web Development, Marketing, and Business Consulting Firm" per the requst of the new pre facto BM
[05/21/2007 10:43:19 AM] Alex Markov: im not 100% sure if like that farm
[05/21/2007 10:43:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nah i like the lone tree better then the hillside
[05/21/2007 10:44:03 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/header2.jpg)www.rp-s.com/header2.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:44:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and a slogan would fit well on the lone tree one, so the fact that the tree is lonely isn't going to matter much
[05/21/2007 10:44:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah that has the right amount of clouds
[05/21/2007 10:44:29 AM] Robert Douglas: header 1 will be very veyr crisp
[05/21/2007 10:44:47 AM] Robert Douglas: but both imo will work
[05/21/2007 10:44:56 AM] Robert Douglas: i think a single tree is kinda lame
[05/21/2007 10:45:05 AM] Robert Douglas: and i think a farm is gay
[05/21/2007 10:45:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hm well we could let her decide
[05/21/2007 10:45:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: surprise us
[05/21/2007 10:45:27 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to buy the image first hto
[05/21/2007 10:45:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just tell her we want a field scape and maybe she can suggest something
[05/21/2007 10:46:06 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.rp-s.com/header3.jpg)www.rp-s.com/header3.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:46:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: too cloudy
[05/21/2007 10:46:24 AM] Robert Douglas: not enough green imo
[05/21/2007 10:46:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:46:37 AM] Robert Douglas: overall i like this the best (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/header1.jpg)http://www.rp-s.com/header1.jpg

[05/21/2007 10:48:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should probably move on
[05/21/2007 10:48:35 AM] Robert Douglas: gotta wait for him
[05/21/2007 10:48:49 AM] Robert Douglas: ifi call his phone
[05/21/2007 10:48:51 AM] Robert Douglas: he will reply

[05/21/2007 10:52:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know i think you might be on to something
[05/21/2007 10:52:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right number of clouds, no lonely tree
[05/21/2007 10:52:34 AM] Alex Markov: what if we have like a little animation. from like a small tree... that then grows RPS fruit. like imagine ryan's rps2 tree. with little peppers hanging off it
[05/21/2007 10:52:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2007 10:52:41 AM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is going to deposit the 1500 into RPS account int he next couple hours
[05/21/2007 10:52:45 AM] Robert Douglas: just gave them account number again

[05/21/2007 10:53:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know i think the growing idea is creative
[05/21/2007 10:53:33 AM] Alex Markov: brian is long overdue for moeny and he need sit ASAP. u have some checks at your house. cut it and mail it so he gets it a day earlier
[05/21/2007 10:53:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what if we animated it so the pepper popped out arms and gave the tree a hug
[05/21/2007 10:53:40 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[05/21/2007 10:53:46 AM] Alex Markov: lol
[05/21/2007 10:53:54 AM] Robert Douglas: brb drops
[05/21/2007 10:54:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2007 10:54:07 AM] Alex Markov: what if the tree in ryan';s mock up had pepper fruit
[05/21/2007 10:54:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol yeah
[05/21/2007 10:54:19 AM] Alex Markov: like isntead of apples... peppers
[05/21/2007 10:54:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i like it
[05/21/2007 10:54:38 AM] Alex Markov: and we have something like "Let RPS help your business grow strong and more profitable"
[05/21/2007 10:54:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2007 10:54:52 AM] Alex Markov: visualzations and imagery is good stuff
[05/21/2007 10:54:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:55:25 AM] Robert Douglas: we can do flash for the header
[05/21/2007 10:55:34 AM] Robert Douglas: have the pepper hug the tree
[05/21/2007 10:55:37 AM] Robert Douglas: like have arms grow out
[05/21/2007 10:55:40 AM] Robert Douglas: and then hug the tree
[05/21/2007 10:55:44 AM] Alex Markov: im not 100% sure we should use flash
[05/21/2007 10:55:46 AM] Robert Douglas: then raise hand and have it display a popup message
[05/21/2007 10:55:54 AM] Alex Markov: we dont want a major part of the site tonot be accesible by idiots without flash
[05/21/2007 10:55:56 AM] Robert Douglas: we can use JS to detect flash, if flash not installed, it will display an image
[05/21/2007 10:56:06 AM] Robert Douglas: else it will display flash movie
[05/21/2007 10:56:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:56:12 AM] Alex Markov: humm
[05/21/2007 10:56:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it would be hot
[05/21/2007 10:56:22 AM] Alex Markov: i dont like the pepper hugging the tree
[05/21/2007 10:56:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2007 10:56:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then we will make the peppers grow out of the tree
[05/21/2007 10:56:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: as its fruit
[05/21/2007 10:56:40 AM] Robert Douglas: lol brian
[05/21/2007 10:57:00 AM] Alex Markov: i think we should have this. like a little small tree
[05/21/2007 10:57:06 AM] Alex Markov: and then it gets bigger and bears pepper fruit
[05/21/2007 10:57:25 AM] Robert Douglas: bring it up again in a month
[05/21/2007 10:57:27 AM] Robert Douglas: then we'll talk
[05/21/2007 10:57:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol ok
[05/21/2007 10:57:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: moving on?
[05/21/2007 10:57:44 AM] Robert Douglas: The template is just too red, we need to have the colors flow, such as adding more greys. 
 
We like the attached button for the login and search buttons. 
 
Increase the font size for the content text to be larger.
[05/21/2007 10:58:05 AM] Robert Douglas: what about the horizontal image?
[05/21/2007 10:58:07 AM] Robert Douglas: which 1 we using?
[05/21/2007 10:58:15 AM] Alex Markov: per request of the pre facto BM.... all change submissions internal and external must be numbered
[05/21/2007 10:58:39 AM] Alex Markov: so reference to a specific change can be made clearly
[05/21/2007 10:58:45 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but u dont number them until u have it written up
[05/21/2007 10:58:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/header2.jpg)http://www.rp-s.com/header2.jpg
[05/21/2007 10:58:57 AM] Alex Markov: no number gith away.
[05/21/2007 10:58:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lone tree
[05/21/2007 10:59:10 AM] Robert Douglas: what alex?
[05/21/2007 10:59:27 AM] Alex Markov: number right away so i can say "change #2 should be a little different" for example
[05/21/2007 10:59:35 AM] Alex Markov: it takes 2 seconds to number
[05/21/2007 10:59:43 AM] Alex Markov: yeah i guess that header 2 looks best
[05/21/2007 10:59:49 AM] Robert Douglas: problem is that a lot of times, u have to renumber shit
[05/21/2007 10:59:52 AM] Robert Douglas: i hate it
[05/21/2007 10:59:55 AM] Robert Douglas: k, i like header 2
[05/21/2007 10:59:59 AM] Robert Douglas: lone tree with some RPS text/slogan written up will work best imo
[05/21/2007 11:00:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 11:00:07 AM] Alex Markov: fine number before submisision

[05/21/2007 11:05:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we moving on to document protocol?
[05/21/2007 11:05:50 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=156#post156)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=156#post156
[05/21/2007 11:06:14 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, if we're going to disucss something, or propose a new idea, write something up saying why we need it, and what it does
[05/21/2007 11:06:20 AM] Robert Douglas: just like how brian did the SVN stuff
[05/21/2007 11:06:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes and i discuss problems with point 2
[05/21/2007 11:07:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and finally point 3 isn't as important but should be mentioned
[05/21/2007 11:07:08 AM] Alex Markov: u forgot the change about the box headers to be changed back to original design
[05/21/2007 11:07:18 AM] Robert Douglas: we're not doing original design
[05/21/2007 11:07:23 AM] Robert Douglas: we're going to try some sort of grey
[05/21/2007 11:07:24 AM] Alex Markov: u like those big red pills?
[05/21/2007 11:07:30 AM] Robert Douglas: no, i said use greys
[05/21/2007 11:07:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i liked original design better
[05/21/2007 11:07:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hm
[05/21/2007 11:07:45 AM] Alex Markov: u didnt attach login and search buttons
[05/21/2007 11:08:04 AM] Robert Douglas: weird
[05/21/2007 11:08:06 AM] Robert Douglas: page refreshed
[05/21/2007 11:08:08 AM] Robert Douglas: so it deleted them
[05/21/2007 11:08:44 AM] Robert Douglas: done
[05/21/2007 11:08:47 AM] Alex Markov: BTW...i downlaoded adobe creative studio premium cs3 over the weekend
[05/21/2007 11:08:48 AM] Alex Markov: :)
[05/21/2007 11:08:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: same
[05/21/2007 11:09:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got web premium and design premium
[05/21/2007 11:09:21 AM] Robert Douglas: brian, link to download?
[05/21/2007 11:09:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: off my server?
[05/21/2007 11:09:30 AM] Robert Douglas: k rps website stuff is done, move on
[05/21/2007 11:09:31 AM] Alex Markov: ok well sort out the treasure later
[05/21/2007 11:09:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 11:09:39 AM] Robert Douglas: for the web premium and design premium stuff
[05/21/2007 11:09:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lets move on
[05/21/2007 11:09:44 AM] Alex Markov: well sort it later
[05/21/2007 11:09:46 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/21/2007 11:09:46 AM] Alex Markov: ok
[05/21/2007 11:10:01 AM] Alex Markov: bitch masters.... brian has the floor
[05/21/2007 11:10:16 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/21/2007 11:10:20 AM] Alex Markov: brian. we need an all encompassing way to organize our documents
[05/21/2007 11:10:27 AM] Alex Markov: what do u have in mind
[05/21/2007 11:10:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, read through the first topic in onenote
[05/21/2007 11:10:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it explains everything about SVN
[05/21/2007 11:11:00 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, already did
[05/21/2007 11:11:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, and what do you think?
[05/21/2007 11:11:21 AM] Robert Douglas: for the document versioning
[05/21/2007 11:11:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sound like a reasonable proposal
[05/21/2007 11:11:23 AM] Alex Markov: i agree that we need verison control
[05/21/2007 11:11:26 AM] Robert Douglas: does it list the changes?
[05/21/2007 11:11:33 AM] Robert Douglas: like what was added/removed?
[05/21/2007 11:11:43 AM] Robert Douglas: or is that not possible with doc
[05/21/2007 11:11:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes with the web tool it will print out changes
[05/21/2007 11:11:53 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: might not be possible with doc
[05/21/2007 11:11:55 AM] Robert Douglas: are you SURE it works with .doc files?
[05/21/2007 11:12:03 AM] Robert Douglas: well, those are the ones we care about
[05/21/2007 11:12:09 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have never tried it, depends on the encoding
[05/21/2007 11:12:11 AM] Robert Douglas: txt and html are useless to us for our document manager
[05/21/2007 11:12:16 AM] Robert Douglas: k, that's something u need to find out
[05/21/2007 11:12:24 AM] Robert Douglas: make a list of stuff you need to do
[05/21/2007 11:12:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes but it will still keep track of versions
[05/21/2007 11:12:37 AM] Robert Douglas: 1. Find out if .doc changes are listed int he versioning.
[05/21/2007 11:13:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so even if we do use the sugar document manager we should still keep track of previous versions in the SVN
[05/21/2007 11:13:35 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Documents&record=e0abc61a-e83e-4ced-bab8-4651e146c9f2&return_module=Documents&return_action=DetailView)https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Documents&record=e0abc61a-e83e-4ced-bab8-4651e146c9f2&return_module=Documents&return_action=DetailView
[05/21/2007 11:13:44 AM] Alex Markov: i made a test docu,ent in sugar document manager
[05/21/2007 11:13:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: additionally, as it stated in the document, SVN will be used for all documents, especially websites, which is the more important thing here
[05/21/2007 11:13:53 AM] Alex Markov: try to press create under document revisions
[05/21/2007 11:13:55 AM] Alex Markov: we get an errr
[05/21/2007 11:14:06 AM] Robert Douglas: brian, stick to document thing now, the website svn will be another convo, k?
[05/21/2007 11:14:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is an easy fix
[05/21/2007 11:14:29 AM] Robert Douglas: i clicekd create
[05/21/2007 11:14:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: absolutely not robert
[05/21/2007 11:14:47 AM] Robert Douglas: this convo right now, is about the DOCUMENT MANAGER
[05/21/2007 11:14:53 AM] Robert Douglas: for rps protocols, contractrs, etc.
[05/21/2007 11:14:53 AM] Alex Markov: i agree. document and web files are all together
[05/21/2007 11:15:01 AM] Alex Markov: images are doucments
[05/21/2007 11:15:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no this is about document protocol
[05/21/2007 11:15:20 AM] Alex Markov: images html files word files excel all documents
[05/21/2007 11:15:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: everything needs to be handled by protocol, and website versions are included in that
[05/21/2007 11:15:33 AM] Robert Douglas: yes, but it is 2 huge areas
[05/21/2007 11:15:36 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to organize it better
[05/21/2007 11:15:44 AM] Robert Douglas: else we're going to be spending hours reasoning through it all
[05/21/2007 11:16:02 AM] Alex Markov: that is the job of the PM of the iDM
[05/21/2007 11:16:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, as i stated in the onenote, i will be writing the document protocol
[05/21/2007 11:16:08 AM] Alex Markov: to reasonn throubh it
[05/21/2007 11:16:17 AM] Alex Markov: we will jsut read it. and give suggestions
[05/21/2007 11:16:31 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but if u try to combine the two ideas now, it is gunna make it more complex
[05/21/2007 11:16:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the document protocol will explain how to handle things such as the document manager in sugar and the SVN
[05/21/2007 11:16:48 AM] Robert Douglas: just suggesting u break it down into document management, and then client website svn management
[05/21/2007 11:17:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not complex, i spelled it out for you in OneNote
[05/21/2007 11:17:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes they are two different sections
[05/21/2007 11:17:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and they will have two different areas in the SCN
[05/21/2007 11:17:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: SVN
[05/21/2007 11:17:29 AM] Alex Markov: how many intenral RPS documents do we rly have 80% of our documents are client related and mostly are images and code
[05/21/2007 11:17:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but if it is organized according to protocol it doesn't matter how large each section is because it will be organized
[05/21/2007 11:17:45 AM] Robert Douglas: i fixed permission error with sugar
[05/21/2007 11:17:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and we are discussing the same thing
[05/21/2007 11:18:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so, allow me to continue, i will find out if there is a way to view documents directly out of the SVN, but that is only part of my proposal
[05/21/2007 11:18:54 AM] Robert Douglas: so what is the point of using a document svn if we have sugar to manage documents?
[05/21/2007 11:19:05 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Documents&record=e0abc61a-e83e-4ced-bab8-4651e146c9f2&return_module=Documents&return_action=DetailView)https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Documents&record=e0abc61a-e83e-4ced-bab8-4651e146c9f2&return_module=Documents&return_action=DetailView
[05/21/2007 11:19:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it breaks down into this, we need a way to store document versions, SVN can provide that, we also need a way to exchange up to date documents, SVN can provide that as well
[05/21/2007 11:19:28 AM] Alex Markov: check that out. now brian. i really like the svn idea. but i also want to see if we can use the sugar documenet manager
[05/21/2007 11:20:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see all you have done is provided a link to a document?
[05/21/2007 11:20:09 AM] Robert Douglas: i think it is gunna be an extra step, and that the sugar is going to work fine
[05/21/2007 11:20:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so how does that display changes online?
[05/21/2007 11:20:17 AM] Alex Markov: i agree. i rly like urpresnetatiyon brian. 
[05/21/2007 11:20:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert you are over complicating things with your request
[05/21/2007 11:20:40 AM] Alex Markov: look at documents revisions
[05/21/2007 11:20:46 AM] Robert Douglas: you already said that .doc may not be listed with changes online
[05/21/2007 11:20:48 AM] Alex Markov: each time a new document is uploaded u can add a change log
[05/21/2007 11:21:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *sigh*
