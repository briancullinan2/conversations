[06/22/2007 04:28:41 PM] Alex Markov: ok guys. this will be one of many many meetings we will haveover the next few years to establish the right environment for RPS
[06/22/2007 04:28:57 PM] Alex Markov: the environment we all must invision is one of teamwork and crazy fast effeciency
[06/22/2007 04:29:07 PM] Alex Markov: and all policies apply to EVERYONE. no exceptions
[06/22/2007 04:29:15 PM] Alex Markov: all present and future policies
[06/22/2007 04:29:36 PM] Alex Markov: u guys are free to yell at me. not like dicks but just point things out
[06/22/2007 04:30:01 PM] Alex Markov: all understand?
[06/22/2007 04:30:06 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[06/22/2007 04:30:14 PM] Alex Markov: ok to clarify things
[06/22/2007 04:30:23 PM] Alex Markov: robert has a few suggestions that he discussed with me
[06/22/2007 04:30:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: understood
[06/22/2007 04:30:32 PM] Alex Markov: and i think should be added to our corporate culutre
[06/22/2007 04:30:35 PM] Alex Markov: he will explain
[06/22/2007 04:30:46 PM] Robert Douglas: eBay does this initial training for new employees called Think Twice, it is a basic presentation about common issues found throughout the workplace. We're going to be putting together policies that will be similar to this Think Twice training. 
 
The main goal is to provide a general list of ways to handle issues throughout the day.
[06/22/2007 04:31:12 PM] Robert Douglas: These policies will be inside the HR forum.
[06/22/2007 04:31:25 PM] Alex Markov: we should come up with a name like think twice
[06/22/2007 04:31:36 PM] Alex Markov: like RPS Culture Guidelines
[06/22/2007 04:31:48 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, we can figure that out later
[06/22/2007 04:31:56 PM] Robert Douglas: this meeting is to notify everyone about the new policies
[06/22/2007 04:31:56 PM] Alex Markov: k everyone think of a name :P
[06/22/2007 04:31:59 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=68)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=68
[06/22/2007 04:32:24 PM] Robert Douglas: Please click on the link and review the 4 policies
[06/22/2007 04:32:32 PM] Alex Markov: we need to put all those in a new forum under HR called RPS Culture Guidelines
[06/22/2007 04:32:59 PM] Robert Douglas: If there are any issues at all preventing ANYONE from following the policy, let's talk about them now.
[06/22/2007 04:33:03 PM] Alex Markov: we will need to revise these over time
[06/22/2007 04:33:46 PM] Robert Douglas: The policies are specifically for any employee/partner. Developers will have a different set of policies to follow.
[06/22/2007 04:33:53 PM] Alex Markov: lets go in order
[06/22/2007 04:33:57 PM] Alex Markov: i like common practices
[06/22/2007 04:34:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: k i disagree
[06/22/2007 04:34:31 PM] Alex Markov: regarding?
[06/22/2007 04:34:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: dealing with tasks
[06/22/2007 04:34:56 PM] Robert Douglas: ok,lets open it up and go over the issues
[06/22/2007 04:35:01 PM] Alex Markov: explain ur point if disagreement
[06/22/2007 04:35:11 PM] Alex Markov: of
[06/22/2007 04:35:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i work on deadlines, not "task priority"
[06/22/2007 04:35:44 PM] Robert Douglas: the priorirty should be determined by deadlines
[06/22/2007 04:36:09 PM] Robert Douglas: you will determine the priorirty based on current issues, deadlines, instructions from manager, ect...
[06/22/2007 04:36:18 PM] Alex Markov: well there will be times. for example. no matter what bobby is working on... if a site goes down... he needs to drop everything and figure out why the site is down
[06/22/2007 04:36:23 PM] Robert Douglas: not you specifically, but everyone in general
[06/22/2007 04:36:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a conflict of interest there as well, what if i get a task that has the highest priority according to Robert, but there is another task that needs to be completely on an internal project for example
[06/22/2007 04:36:55 PM] Alex Markov: well then the priority needs to be discussed briefly and then order eneds to be defined
[06/22/2007 04:37:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to be more strict with deadlines, deadlines are more important then these new log emails
[06/22/2007 04:37:09 PM] Alex Markov: problem with sugar is it does not have a order list as of yet. 
[06/22/2007 04:37:26 PM] Alex Markov: so for now we must all keep track of our priorities  in our own ways in to do lists
[06/22/2007 04:37:35 PM] Alex Markov: i agree about deadlines brian
[06/22/2007 04:37:58 PM] Robert Douglas: in your example brian, you will want to follow the Common Practices post
[06/22/2007 04:38:05 PM] Alex Markov: we need to start setting deadlines for tasks. here is an issue with that tho. when someone makes someone a task. how can they set a deadline. 
[06/22/2007 04:38:07 PM] Robert Douglas: if you are not sure what to be done, ask the person about it
[06/22/2007 04:38:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we had more strict deadlines there would never be a problem to what order something is done in, because i would get it done
[06/22/2007 04:38:44 PM] Alex Markov: like it is ineffecient to talk to soemeone every time before u set the task deadline
[06/22/2007 04:39:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you use the task manager in sugar this can be accomplished
[06/22/2007 04:39:17 PM] Alex Markov: yes but say you guys have a task for me
[06/22/2007 04:39:37 PM] Alex Markov: how in the hell do u decide what to make the deadline
[06/22/2007 04:40:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: discuss it with the developer involved in the task
[06/22/2007 04:40:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: agree on a reasonable amount of time that the task can be completed
[06/22/2007 04:40:21 PM] Robert Douglas: for example, if you are working on an internal task, and someone notifies you that a client's website isn't working, or changes need to be done, you should tell the person who is giving you the task "i'm working on internal projhect X"
[06/22/2007 04:40:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: sound reasonable?
[06/22/2007 04:40:45 PM] Robert Douglas: then the person who gave u the task, will determine which one is more important
[06/22/2007 04:40:52 PM] Alex Markov: so a pre task assignment discussion my occur?
[06/22/2007 04:41:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i suppose so
[06/22/2007 04:41:47 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be done int he order you received the task
[06/22/2007 04:41:53 PM] Alex Markov: im not sure thats the best option
[06/22/2007 04:42:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what exactly is the problem here? i get the feeling that robert has some hostility towards me because i've been doing something wrong
[06/22/2007 04:42:17 PM] Alex Markov: because we will need to hunt down each person and chat with them?
[06/22/2007 04:42:22 PM] Robert Douglas: wouldyou like specific examples Brian?
[06/22/2007 04:42:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i certainly have a problem with something he has been doing
[06/22/2007 04:42:30 PM] Alex Markov: no robert is jsut stressed out in general. dont worry
[06/22/2007 04:42:39 PM] Robert Douglas: this policy is a general one for everyone
[06/22/2007 04:42:47 PM] Robert Douglas: including myself and alex
[06/22/2007 04:43:03 PM] Alex Markov: so wait jhow do we set deadlines
[06/22/2007 04:43:43 PM] Alex Markov: how do we decide when to set a deadline for?
[06/22/2007 04:43:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: my problem is robert constantly tells me what i should be working on
[06/22/2007 04:44:20 PM] Alex Markov: well u are still easing into our operations brian. u still only know the tip of the iceberg about what goes on. 
[06/22/2007 04:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i feel that although he did not sign every specific tasks, i have my own list of corrections that should be made to websites for example
[06/22/2007 04:44:34 PM] Alex Markov: its not so much as he is telling u as he is guiding you. 
[06/22/2007 04:44:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, he is not guiding me
[06/22/2007 04:45:12 PM] Robert Douglas: also, if there is an issue at time of the task assignment, follow the Common Practices guildeline "If you are instructed to do something, and do not plan on doing it, instead of ignoring the instructions, you must discuss the issues with the person who instructed you of the issue."
[06/22/2007 04:45:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can handle guiding, this is demanding a change in my entire work ethic
[06/22/2007 04:45:34 PM] Robert Douglas: you're new to the businessworld Brian, i had a big change of work ethics when i started working with alex
[06/22/2007 04:45:38 PM] Alex Markov: we must all be on the same page tho brian
[06/22/2007 04:46:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am new to the business world?
[06/22/2007 04:46:04 PM] Robert Douglas: I had the same issue, it wasnt until a couple months ago before i finally got most of it nailed down
[06/22/2007 04:46:13 PM] Robert Douglas: to the business structure of a company
[06/22/2007 04:46:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: see this is the problem right fucking here
[06/22/2007 04:46:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: he assumes that he knows everything
[06/22/2007 04:46:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not fucking new to the business world
[06/22/2007 04:46:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have had previous experience in IT and webdesign
[06/22/2007 04:46:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so how about we continue this conversation when you set your fucking ego aside
[06/22/2007 04:46:56 PM] Robert Douglas: what businesses have you worked for?
[06/22/2007 04:47:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't know anything about be, and definitely not enough to make a judgement like that
[06/22/2007 04:47:33 PM] Alex Markov: agreed. that still doesnt change the fact the we must all be on the same page
[06/22/2007 04:47:40 PM] Alex Markov: regardless of how we get there
[06/22/2007 04:47:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i thought you;ve only done development and support stuff, i didn't know you actually had other jobs other than that, my mistake
[06/22/2007 04:48:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we can all benefit if we just stop assuming
[06/22/2007 04:48:10 PM] Alex Markov: agreed
[06/22/2007 04:48:40 PM] Alex Markov: ok so back to this. how do we set deadlines?
[06/22/2007 04:48:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert assumes that i should be working on a certain task, both of you assume that i have no clue what a company should run like, and i assume that you guys know what i am thiking all the time
[06/22/2007 04:49:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if we set deadlines robert and I won't have any more conflicts as to features being implemented
[06/22/2007 04:49:23 PM] Alex Markov: should deadlines just be set? then if someone cant meet it.... they must contact the task assigner and reschedule deadline?
[06/22/2007 04:49:25 PM] Robert Douglas: let's just move on brian, these convos just go around in a circle
[06/22/2007 04:49:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes alex
[06/22/2007 04:49:53 PM] Robert Douglas: although there is a deadline,the order for tasks to be done still exists
[06/22/2007 04:50:01 PM] Robert Douglas: some tasks are more important than other
[06/22/2007 04:50:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example when robert sends me a new task, he should include a suggested deadline, if i can't get it done by that time, i will discuss it with him directly
[06/22/2007 04:50:39 PM] Alex Markov: we need a workflow setup to email someone when a new task is created
[06/22/2007 04:50:43 PM] Alex Markov: for someone
[06/22/2007 04:50:50 PM] Alex Markov: so someone can see right away a new task was created
[06/22/2007 04:51:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can set up the workflow
[06/22/2007 04:51:34 PM] Robert Douglas: that's fine with me, but everything in "dealing with tasks" still stands
[06/22/2007 04:51:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: agreed
[06/22/2007 04:51:52 PM] Alex Markov: well as i see it... all deadlines msut now be tighter then
[06/22/2007 04:51:53 PM] Robert Douglas: the only thing changing is how tasks are assigned (they are in a workflow instead)
[06/22/2007 04:52:07 PM] Alex Markov: well now then all tasks must be assigned in sugar
[06/22/2007 04:52:14 PM] Alex Markov: if they are not assigned in sugar... than they dont get done
[06/22/2007 04:53:25 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, so just to make sure, Dealing with Tasks is correct
[06/22/2007 04:53:51 PM] Robert Douglas: this would apply to dealing with all tasks, all ones assigned in sugar, and all tasks assigned via phone/msn
[06/22/2007 04:53:53 PM] Alex Markov: tasks in sugar has a priority option
[06/22/2007 04:54:14 PM] Robert Douglas: once sugar is setup, we'll try to put the majority of them inside of sugar
[06/22/2007 04:54:25 PM] Alex Markov: well we should just start now
[06/22/2007 04:54:32 PM] Robert Douglas: however, the "Dealing with Tasks" policy still stands, no matter the way you receove tje tasl
[06/22/2007 04:54:35 PM] Robert Douglas: the task*
[06/22/2007 04:54:38 PM] Alex Markov: it takes like 2 minutes to setup a task. its a pain. but it will keep tjhings effecient
[06/22/2007 04:54:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes start now, i will work on the workflow before my next beer
[06/22/2007 04:54:49 PM] Robert Douglas: but not all tasks will be able to be assigned via sugar
[06/22/2007 04:54:54 PM] Robert Douglas: some will be msn or phone
[06/22/2007 04:55:06 PM] Robert Douglas: and they will still have to follow the same protocol
[06/22/2007 04:55:23 PM] Alex Markov: then perhaps a task corresponded over msn or phone... needs to be made into a sugar task
[06/22/2007 04:55:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 04:55:36 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll need to create a policy on assigning tasks, so everyone knows what to do
[06/22/2007 04:55:38 PM] Alex Markov: that way everything is jsut tracked in sugar
[06/22/2007 04:55:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think every task should be able to be put in sugar
[06/22/2007 04:55:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: there isn't really any reason why it can't be
[06/22/2007 04:56:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean sugar is a CRM suite, it can handle everything
[06/22/2007 04:56:04 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, so then if someone assigns a task outside of the sugar, the assignee should create the task?
[06/22/2007 04:56:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 04:56:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: especially if the task has a deadline
[06/22/2007 04:56:35 PM] Robert Douglas: ok,so the assigner over the phone notifies the assignee of the new task
[06/22/2007 04:56:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is most important that tasks with specific deadlines show up in sugar
[06/22/2007 04:56:48 PM] Robert Douglas: then the assignee puts taskin sugar
[06/22/2007 04:56:54 PM] Alex Markov: the assignee must then setup a task
[06/22/2007 04:56:56 PM] Robert Douglas: and follows the "Dealing with Tasks" guidelines
[06/22/2007 04:57:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, either the assigner or the assignee should put it in
[06/22/2007 04:57:04 PM] Alex Markov: they will discuss brief deadline
[06/22/2007 04:57:12 PM] Alex Markov: yeah who is ever can
[06/22/2007 04:57:28 PM] Robert Douglas: usually if taskis over phone,assignee  will be the one ont he computer, who will be able to do it
[06/22/2007 04:57:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: if its agreed upon over the phone or IM whoever gets there first should create the task
[06/22/2007 04:57:41 PM] Alex Markov: yep agreed
[06/22/2007 04:57:51 PM] Alex Markov: and lets not be lazy about it. man up and assign task if u hoenstly can
[06/22/2007 04:57:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/22/2007 04:58:15 PM] Robert Douglas: before the assignee begins the task, he/she should create it in sugar first
[06/22/2007 04:58:17 PM] Alex Markov: how bout we say that high priority tasks must done in 24 hours
[06/22/2007 04:58:27 PM] Alex Markov: i think we should have a extreme priority
[06/22/2007 04:58:28 PM] Robert Douglas: no alex,we cant set a specific deadline like that
[06/22/2007 04:58:29 PM] Alex Markov: or like urgent
[06/22/2007 04:58:39 PM] Alex Markov: i think we should
[06/22/2007 04:58:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will be agreed upon when the task is discussed
[06/22/2007 04:59:00 PM] Robert Douglas: some tasks need to be done within the hour
[06/22/2007 04:59:03 PM] Alex Markov: i think if we have a deadline to meet and we are disciplined with emeting deadlines people will meet them
[06/22/2007 04:59:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: that simple
[06/22/2007 04:59:47 PM] Alex Markov: this is something news companies do 
[06/22/2007 04:59:50 PM] Alex Markov: they set deadliens for everything
[06/22/2007 04:59:55 PM] Alex Markov: they are rlky extreme about them
[06/22/2007 05:00:03 PM] Alex Markov: like a tv show
[06/22/2007 05:00:06 PM] Alex Markov: or a newspaper
[06/22/2007 05:00:15 PM] Alex Markov: lawyers work like that too
[06/22/2007 05:00:19 PM] Alex Markov: for court cases and stuff
[06/22/2007 05:00:26 PM] Alex Markov: all projects will have a major deadline
[06/22/2007 05:00:40 PM] Alex Markov: and all tasks need to be organized to meet that deadline
[06/22/2007 05:00:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i have a problem with this email every 15 minutes thing
[06/22/2007 05:00:53 PM] Alex Markov: wait
[06/22/2007 05:00:56 PM] Alex Markov: we will get to that
[06/22/2007 05:01:03 PM] Robert Douglas: so, we are all agreed on (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118 now right?
[06/22/2007 05:01:04 PM] Alex Markov: so from now on. all tasks should be in sugar
[06/22/2007 05:01:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 05:01:28 PM] Alex Markov: if a high priority taks is applied... that task must take precedent over all and be handled right away
[06/22/2007 05:01:46 PM] Robert Douglas: ok good,since we allagree on (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118 , lets move onto next policy
[06/22/2007 05:01:53 PM] Alex Markov: if anyone has 2 high priority tasks... then briefly contact the person who made it and discuss whcih sho9uld be done first
[06/22/2007 05:02:11 PM] Alex Markov: all agree?
[06/22/2007 05:02:19 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, that's all inside ofdealing with tasks
[06/22/2007 05:02:20 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117
[06/22/2007 05:02:25 PM] Robert Douglas: moving onto email policy> (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117
[06/22/2007 05:02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: anyone who disagrees,speakup with reasons
[06/22/2007 05:03:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so, i agree that we should keep in touch through e-mail, but there will be days that i don't get to my e-mails until hours after someone has sent me something
[06/22/2007 05:04:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i shouldn't be required to live infront of my e-mail waiting in anticipation for someone to send me an e-mail
[06/22/2007 05:04:13 PM] Alex Markov: well what i have setup is outlook checks emails every minute
[06/22/2007 05:04:25 PM] Alex Markov: and a little pop up pops up in bottom corner whene mail is sent
[06/22/2007 05:04:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i have that too
[06/22/2007 05:04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: the email policy goes over that Brian > It is understandable that if you are away from the computer, you will not be able to stay on top of your e-mail. 
[06/22/2007 05:04:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: when its open
[06/22/2007 05:04:29 PM] Alex Markov: i check all emaisl RIGHT AWAY
[06/22/2007 05:04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt that cover the issue you bring up?
[06/22/2007 05:05:01 PM] Alex Markov: if it is important... i respond right away saying i will look into it and get back to you and i put a flag on the email "to repspond"
[06/22/2007 05:05:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so if i am away or now checking my e-mail i don't need someone to comment on my now being around every 5 minutes
[06/22/2007 05:05:26 PM] Alex Markov: yes but brian outlook and email should be open ALL day
[06/22/2007 05:05:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont quite understand your last comment brian
[06/22/2007 05:06:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so if i am away or not checking my e-mail i don't need someone to comment on my not being around every 5 minutes
[06/22/2007 05:06:54 PM] Alex Markov: agreed
[06/22/2007 05:07:03 PM] Robert Douglas: repeating your comment over again doesnt make it anymore clear
[06/22/2007 05:07:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was not instead of now
[06/22/2007 05:07:13 PM] Alex Markov: but sometimes people will question others if people got the email
[06/22/2007 05:07:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats fine, then i will know to check it
[06/22/2007 05:07:35 PM] Alex Markov: and then we must simply say "no not yet. let me check"
[06/22/2007 05:08:04 PM] Robert Douglas: if you are not at your computer, you shouldnt be required to check your email, since there isnt a way for you to check it
[06/22/2007 05:08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: however,when you are, you should check it every 15-30 mins
[06/22/2007 05:08:39 PM] Robert Douglas: does that clear ur your question?
[06/22/2007 05:08:53 PM] Alex Markov: well i dont think every 15-30minutes is a good guide. i think all emaisl should be briefly looked at when they come in
[06/22/2007 05:08:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but complaining about me not responding to an e-mail 20 minutes after it was sent is not only annoying but its like that person expects me to live just answer their emails, its kind of conceited
[06/22/2007 05:09:19 PM] Robert Douglas: right, 20 mintues isn't an issue, but if an email is sent out and you dont reply for 2 HOURS, then we do have an issue
[06/22/2007 05:09:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can guarantee that every e-mail gets a reply every day
[06/22/2007 05:09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: especially if you are consistant with doing that
[06/22/2007 05:09:37 PM] Alex Markov: yeah but when u get an email. perhaps we should tell the receipeient "got ur email. ill get to it ASAP"
[06/22/2007 05:10:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some e-mails contain tasks that need to be completed soon, but the task deadline cannot be before the deadline in known by all parties
[06/22/2007 05:10:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: like you can't request something be done, before everyone knowns about it
[06/22/2007 05:11:39 PM] Alex Markov: often tho some tasks need to be rushed or finessed by people in the form of phonecalls or IMs
[06/22/2007 05:11:46 PM] Alex Markov: so we must be patient 
[06/22/2007 05:11:55 PM] Alex Markov: if someone tries to facilitate a task
[06/22/2007 05:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are referring to corrections on a website, the urgency would not be so high if we had a dev site for every website in progress
[06/22/2007 05:13:04 PM] Robert Douglas: the reason for the email policy, is that we want to make sure that while you are at your computer,you are checking yuour emails every 15-30 minutes, and that you are replying to emails that need to be replied to
[06/22/2007 05:13:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: because errors can sit on a dev site and not matter because the live site will still be fine
[06/22/2007 05:13:13 PM] Alex Markov: agreed. our company structure is not finished
[06/22/2007 05:14:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i can agree that if i am infront of my computer i will check emails more often and reply to them within reasonable time based on the urgency of the e-mail
[06/22/2007 05:15:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but can i guarantee every 15 minutes? no, especially when i have class in the morning
[06/22/2007 05:15:02 PM] Robert Douglas: the policy isn't "more often" it is "15-30 minutes"
[06/22/2007 05:15:30 PM] Robert Douglas: also,when you are in class, it doesnt apply, because it follows "It is understandable that if you are away from the computer, you will not be able to stay on top of your e-mail. "
[06/22/2007 05:16:01 PM] Alex Markov: but we msut never get upset if someone asks about an email
[06/22/2007 05:16:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: agreed
[06/22/2007 05:16:09 PM] Alex Markov: i often send an email to bobby
[06/22/2007 05:16:29 PM] Alex Markov: and then call him right awya and tell hima bout it
[06/22/2007 05:16:31 PM] Alex Markov: brb phone
[06/22/2007 05:16:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so we're all agreed to the new policy now?
[06/22/2007 05:17:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 05:18:00 PM] Robert Douglas: last one is (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=116)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=116
[06/22/2007 05:18:04 PM] Robert Douglas: any disagreements?
[06/22/2007 05:19:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: none here
[06/22/2007 05:19:15 PM] Robert Douglas: k, i know alex alrady agreed to them all
[06/22/2007 05:19:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't want to recieve everyone else's
[06/22/2007 05:19:41 PM] Robert Douglas: that's something we need to talk about
[06/22/2007 05:20:07 PM] Robert Douglas: what is your goal with RPS? what do you want to be doing? what do you want to get out of the company?
[06/22/2007 05:20:33 PM] Robert Douglas: we're trying to get a list of what you want,so we know if you really are wanting to be a partner, or just planning to be a commonly used developer
[06/22/2007 05:20:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand why my loyalty to the company is in question?
[06/22/2007 05:21:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: what brought up these questions
[06/22/2007 05:21:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[06/22/2007 05:21:20 PM] Robert Douglas: do you want specific comments?
[06/22/2007 05:21:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/22/2007 05:21:31 PM] Robert Douglas: Brian Cullinan says: 
but i don't want to recieve everyone else's
[06/22/2007 05:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah there is no reason for me to know what everyone else is doing every day
[06/22/2007 05:21:58 PM] Robert Douglas: Brian Cullinan says (12:48 PM): 
but sometimes you won't, so you will have to deal with it 

[06/22/2007 05:22:15 PM] Robert Douglas: if you want to be a partner, it should be something you WANT to know
[06/22/2007 05:22:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that last comment was in reference to you complaining about me not e-mailing you back immediately
[06/22/2007 05:22:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do i need to know everyone that alex calls every day?
[06/22/2007 05:22:49 PM] Robert Douglas: remember the movie The Breakup? when the chick complains about the guy not doing dishes? same thing goes, he should want to help out
[06/22/2007 05:22:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: that doesn't make any sense
[06/22/2007 05:23:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is good to have the tasks completed on record
[06/22/2007 05:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that if say i needed to look them up i could
[06/22/2007 05:23:32 PM] Robert Douglas: these are just some things int he past day or so
[06/22/2007 05:23:45 PM] Robert Douglas: so back to the questions
[06/22/2007 05:23:46 PM] Robert Douglas: what is your goal with RPS? what do you want to be doing? what do you want to get out of the company?
[06/22/2007 05:25:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i would like to build this company into a smooth running machine, something that sells a product just like any other company, and what i would like to get out of it is payment, job security, retirement benefits, etc
[06/22/2007 05:25:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i've told you my secret, why don't you answer that question
[06/22/2007 05:25:53 PM] Robert Douglas: what about development? it sounds like your wanting to helpo out in organization structure
[06/22/2007 05:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: see thats what i do as a manager, i work on making the company efficient and do internal stuff
[06/22/2007 05:27:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i enjoy developing but that is from a specialist standpoint
[06/22/2007 05:27:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am more then happy to do development
[06/22/2007 05:27:37 PM] Robert Douglas: so your plan is to do less development work, and more management stuff?
[06/22/2007 05:28:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i think eventually, with you being in california, if i do PM work, that is fine too
[06/22/2007 05:28:34 PM] Robert Douglas: as per my ignorance of not know more about your abilities, what experience have you had from the business side of things, as opposed to development side?
[06/22/2007 05:28:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: whatever it takes to sell that product
[06/22/2007 05:30:47 PM] Alex Markov: back
[06/22/2007 05:30:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have had my dads work ethic and manager influence all my life, i worked all summer in his office learning what he did as a manager and operations in his workplace
[06/22/2007 05:31:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like you robert, i spent hours talking about how to manage a company, and i picked up a lot
[06/22/2007 05:31:16 PM] Robert Douglas: any spceficif management type tasks u can relate to, to give me a better idea of actual experience?
[06/22/2007 05:32:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i worked mostly in the IT department, i shared responsibilities with the other IT guy, there were things like server management, organization, assisting other employees with issues they were having
[06/22/2007 05:33:04 PM] Alex Markov: let me throw my two cents in. i jsut read what u guys wrote
[06/22/2007 05:33:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: now, i'm not saying that i should be doing anyone elses job, all i am saying is that i have some experience, and would be able to handle a manager position
[06/22/2007 05:34:10 PM] Alex Markov: regarding brian's reluctance to want to knwo what we all do. i agree on some level. it is somewhat moot to know what everyone does. especially if we become crazily deciplined with tasks and deadlines
[06/22/2007 05:34:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: HTTPme ticket (48078) about log details/protocol, requested 7 days of access logs as opposed to 3, inquired about full functionality of log rotation
[06/22/2007 05:35:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see how that relates to anything i am doing currently
[06/22/2007 05:35:26 PM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt relate to u, but it gives u knowledge about what the major people are doing with the company
[06/22/2007 05:35:33 PM] Alex Markov: i agree. howevr. i think it is useful for all of us to know details about what we all do
[06/22/2007 05:35:46 PM] Alex Markov: for example. whenw e pull someone else into the company... i think it would be very valuable to know what they do daily
[06/22/2007 05:35:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we just need a better way to log everything
[06/22/2007 05:36:16 PM] Alex Markov: we dont need to udnerstand everything everyone does... but it is VERY useful to skim everyone;s daily log 
[06/22/2007 05:36:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that certain topics of items can be categorized and looked up later if needed
[06/22/2007 05:36:50 PM] Alex Markov: well we can search in outlook
[06/22/2007 05:37:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think sugar should be able to handle it
[06/22/2007 05:37:13 PM] Alex Markov: email is jsut very simple and outlook automatically saves the draft if ur computer crashes
[06/22/2007 05:37:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, then i will take your suggestion and put all the time sheets in a different folder
[06/22/2007 05:37:50 PM] Robert Douglas: you dont need to keep track of previous ones
[06/22/2007 05:39:39 PM] Alex Markov: yeah i dont see a reason to save them really. i think posting a daily log is the same thing as chatting with someone and notifing them of what people are doing
[06/22/2007 05:40:01 PM] Alex Markov: its just like me calling bobby and aksing him what he did today
[06/22/2007 05:40:13 PM] Alex Markov: however with a worklog... we jsut knwo that every day we will get an update
[06/22/2007 05:40:32 PM] Alex Markov: i personally like updates. i am somewhat removed from alot of things
[06/22/2007 05:40:40 PM] Alex Markov: and u guys are removed from my world a bit
[06/22/2007 05:40:54 PM] Alex Markov: like when our accoutnign starts full force. it would be good for u guys to know little details about what goes on
[06/22/2007 05:41:03 PM] Alex Markov: furthermore we can give each other comments on certain things
[06/22/2007 05:41:39 PM] Alex Markov: i think daily logs are important
[06/22/2007 05:41:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: isn't there anywhere in sugar to put a log?
[06/22/2007 05:42:12 PM] Robert Douglas: Brian, you have an outstanding email about 4 hours old with AZRN stuff...
[06/22/2007 05:42:18 PM] Robert Douglas: no, we want it in an email
[06/22/2007 05:42:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: 4 hours old?
[06/22/2007 05:42:37 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want to keep track of them, we just want to be able to get a report of the work log
[06/22/2007 05:42:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am confused
[06/22/2007 05:42:54 PM] Alex Markov: yes it is the same as having a brief chat with somene over msn or phone
[06/22/2007 05:43:16 PM] Robert Douglas: Brian > Ticket #CGY-13760-615: AZRN Database Questions/Issues  
[06/22/2007 05:44:24 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, i need to head out to verizon's store
[06/22/2007 05:44:35 PM] Robert Douglas: but it sounds like all of our policies will be followed
[06/22/2007 05:44:42 PM] Robert Douglas: and that everything in the policy is correct
[06/22/2007 05:45:10 PM] Robert Douglas: we will have to create a policy on how we assign tasks, but that cant be done until brian does the workflow thing with sugar
[06/22/2007 05:45:46 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/22/2007 05:47:08 PM] Robert Douglas: alrtight, i;ll be back later
[06/22/2007 05:47:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/22/2007 05:47:42 PM] Robert Douglas: dont forget to add "- Meeting about new policies in HR forum"to the work log
