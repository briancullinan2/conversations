[05/21/2007 09:06:32 AM] Alex Markov: and in the web design kit the author talked about hiring a business manager
[05/21/2007 09:06:41 AM] Alex Markov: now eventually... we will hire a professional business manager
[05/21/2007 09:06:57 AM] Alex Markov: but for now i will do the job for free
[05/21/2007 09:07:04 AM] Alex Markov: now here are some changes to the new structure
[05/21/2007 09:07:14 AM] Alex Markov: 1. we must imitate other succesful companies
[05/21/2007 09:07:23 AM] Alex Markov: that means 1. more normal business schedule
[05/21/2007 09:07:29 AM] Robert Douglas: we're all doing the job though, that's the thing
[05/21/2007 09:07:40 AM] Robert Douglas: we're all doing it forfree
[05/21/2007 09:07:42 AM] Alex Markov: 2. normal business structure (busienss manager oversees day to day operations and makes sure things run right)
[05/21/2007 09:07:53 AM] Robert Douglas: well, u and me are, brian is just starting to get into it
[05/21/2007 09:08:05 AM] Alex Markov: trust me. u will see a difference
[05/21/2007 09:08:19 AM] Robert Douglas: who is gunna wake u up at 11am asking u why u not up working yet lol
[05/21/2007 09:08:28 AM] Alex Markov: by more normal busienss structure.... i mean this. we need to be up working at 9am. no exceptions. 
[05/21/2007 09:08:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/21/2007 09:08:39 AM] Alex Markov: yeah chill bobby jsut hear me out
[05/21/2007 09:08:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i try robert
[05/21/2007 09:09:02 AM] Alex Markov: the reaosn we need more normal business schedules... is because the whole world of global busienss does it. so we should too. 
[05/21/2007 09:09:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i had school all year, unlike you
[05/21/2007 09:09:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i deserve a break after that
[05/21/2007 09:09:15 AM] Alex Markov: yes other responsibilities will sometimes get in the way
[05/21/2007 09:09:32 AM] Alex Markov: ALSO.... since deadlines will now be MAJOR 
[05/21/2007 09:09:45 AM] Alex Markov: there will be times we will be working ALOT to meet a specific deadline
[05/21/2007 09:09:48 AM] Alex Markov: like a lawyer does
[05/21/2007 09:09:54 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 09:09:54 AM] Alex Markov: or a newspaper reporter
[05/21/2007 09:10:06 AM] Alex Markov: so on those times... if we are all up til like 3am. we will slepe in a little
[05/21/2007 09:10:21 AM] Alex Markov: as busienss manager. i want access to both of your weekly schedules
[05/21/2007 09:10:34 AM] Alex Markov: i want to know where u are and what u are doing between the hours of 9-5 every day
[05/21/2007 09:10:34 AM] Robert Douglas: we all need access to each other's schedules
[05/21/2007 09:10:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: question
[05/21/2007 09:10:47 AM] Alex Markov: if you go out to the dog park. send me a emssage or call me
[05/21/2007 09:10:49 AM] Alex Markov: if you go get lunch
[05/21/2007 09:10:50 AM] Alex Markov: same
[05/21/2007 09:10:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can sugar handle scheduling?
[05/21/2007 09:11:00 AM] Alex Markov: yes we need to explore it
[05/21/2007 09:11:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be a great place to put it
[05/21/2007 09:11:27 AM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/21/2007 09:11:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even if we just add a field under employees and type it out
[05/21/2007 09:11:46 AM] Robert Douglas: we want it so it sybcs with outlook and treo though
[05/21/2007 09:11:55 AM] Robert Douglas: but everyone's schedule should be available
[05/21/2007 09:12:05 AM] Robert Douglas: i think that was an issue before with sugar, right alex?
[05/21/2007 09:12:09 AM] Alex Markov: well every week we are going to have different schedules. but the business manager (even if it is someone else in the future) should know what everyone is doing at ALL times
[05/21/2007 09:12:40 AM] Alex Markov: also the reaosn for a normal business schedule is that.... after 5pm.... we are free. we can go play video games. and go hang out.
[05/21/2007 09:12:56 AM] Robert Douglas: except, lots of people in this business, work better outside the 9-5
[05/21/2007 09:12:58 AM] Robert Douglas: like me/brian
[05/21/2007 09:13:06 AM] Alex Markov: let me explain the problem with that
[05/21/2007 09:13:08 AM] Robert Douglas: we're not gunna do 9-5
[05/21/2007 09:13:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you're right we should be doing 9am to 12am
[05/21/2007 09:14:07 AM] Alex Markov: right now... i am in a state of "constant work" that means i feel like i should be working all day. but that does not happen. because if you know your work day is going to be longer u slack
[05/21/2007 09:14:09 AM] Robert Douglas: i think it should be more open
[05/21/2007 09:14:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fucking 15 hour work day
[05/21/2007 09:14:26 AM] Alex Markov: sec
[05/21/2007 09:14:35 AM] Alex Markov: when i worked 9-5 jobs before... u had to finish everything by that 5pm.... and u really busted your balls too. and then u were FREEE
[05/21/2007 09:14:41 AM] Alex Markov: now it will not be 9-5 all the time
[05/21/2007 09:15:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this isn't really a high priority as long as we meet deadlines, can we continue?
