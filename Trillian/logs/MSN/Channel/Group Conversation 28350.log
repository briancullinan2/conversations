[05/21/2007 09:30:54 AM] Robert Douglas: msn has note section tho i think
[05/21/2007 09:30:54 AM] Alex Markov: MSN messenger sucks because u cannot paste long text into it. u cannot transfer files quickly
[05/21/2007 09:31:06 AM] Alex Markov: i HATE that we cannot transfer long paragraphs
[05/21/2007 09:31:09 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: one note is so easy to use though
[05/21/2007 09:31:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i love onenote
[05/21/2007 09:31:16 AM] Robert Douglas: i hate onenote

[05/21/2007 09:31:29 AM] Alex Markov: not a few programs that have calaboration
[05/21/2007 09:31:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i like being able to click anywhere and type
[05/21/2007 09:31:45 AM] Robert Douglas: MS has one we should use
[05/21/2007 09:31:49 AM] Robert Douglas: it integrates into outlook
[05/21/2007 09:31:53 AM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/21/2007 09:31:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: whats it called?
[05/21/2007 09:32:09 AM] Robert Douglas: once we get some more decent monthlies, we can research that, until then, let's just use this shitty msn
[05/21/2007 09:32:10 AM] Alex Markov: ok who wants to be in charge of developing the RPS Online Meeting
[05/21/2007 09:32:18 AM] Alex Markov: agreed
[05/21/2007 09:32:19 AM] Robert Douglas: we will all will
[05/21/2007 09:32:22 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/21/2007 09:32:24 AM] Robert Douglas: we all will
[05/21/2007 09:32:47 AM] Alex Markov: no. each internal project will have deadlines and an internal manager
[05/21/2007 09:33:11 AM] Alex Markov: brian is manager of the documenet management backbone of RPS right now. he can give us orders. but he must meet deadlines 
[05/21/2007 09:33:14 AM] Alex Markov: this brings us to another topic
[05/21/2007 09:33:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need to talk about website first
[05/21/2007 09:33:36 AM] Alex Markov: we MUST stop with the mentality "oh this can wait until next week"
[05/21/2007 09:33:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you get my notes?
[05/21/2007 09:33:49 AM] Robert Douglas: i dont have ur notes
[05/21/2007 09:33:51 AM] Alex Markov: this is how modernbill was delayed for 6 months and this is how we lost $1000 in sales
[05/21/2007 09:33:58 AM] Alex Markov: yes i did get on files
[05/21/2007 09:34:00 AM] Alex Markov: send to b
[05/21/2007 09:34:14 AM] Robert Douglas: being sent
[05/21/2007 09:34:18 AM] Robert Douglas: msn slow transfer
[05/21/2007 09:34:41 AM] Alex Markov: we need to stop delaying thigns and pushing them off. if they can be done now. then do them. this goes for me too ofcourse
[05/21/2007 09:35:08 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, things that need to be done now, should be done now
[05/21/2007 09:35:12 AM] Robert Douglas: things that can wait, can wait
[05/21/2007 09:35:18 AM] Alex Markov: no things that can be done now... should be done now
[05/21/2007 09:35:38 AM] Robert Douglas: that's what i just said
[05/21/2007 09:35:42 AM] Robert Douglas: "Merlin says: 
yeah, things that need to be done now, should be done now"
[05/21/2007 09:35:55 AM] Alex Markov: yes but our definition of "what can wait" is to lax
[05/21/2007 09:36:12 AM] Alex Markov: modernbill waited for months and months and months. and we missed out on monthlies for months and months
[05/21/2007 09:36:18 AM] Alex Markov: all because it could be done "next week" every week
[05/21/2007 09:36:24 AM] Alex Markov: same with accounting
[05/21/2007 09:36:27 AM] Robert Douglas: no, it wasnt that
[05/21/2007 09:36:32 AM] Robert Douglas: i forget what it was with MB
[05/21/2007 09:36:39 AM] Alex Markov: we must tackle our big problems NOW. not next week
[05/21/2007 09:36:40 AM] Robert Douglas: we had issues with the version
[05/21/2007 09:36:41 AM] Alex Markov: it doesnt matter
[05/21/2007 09:36:48 AM] Alex Markov: what happen in the past
[05/21/2007 09:36:54 AM] Alex Markov: it only matters what happens int he  future
[05/21/2007 09:37:14 AM] Alex Markov: so this documenet management  issue.... in theory it can wait until next week. and next month. but we must handle it this week
[05/21/2007 09:37:21 AM] Alex Markov: once its setup. its setup for ever
[05/21/2007 09:37:23 AM] Alex Markov: like pmxp
[05/21/2007 09:37:27 AM] Alex Markov: even tho its not a perfect system
[05/21/2007 09:37:38 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we need to first figure out what we're gunna implement
[05/21/2007 09:37:41 AM] Robert Douglas: and then when we need it by
[05/21/2007 09:37:50 AM] Alex Markov: all our contracts are different. we dont use document tempaltes. we waste hours a week on that
[05/21/2007 09:37:57 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm still waiting brian to send the stuff
[05/21/2007 09:38:17 AM] Alex Markov: well brian is in charge of it.... at the endl of this meeting we will set a deadline. 
[05/21/2007 09:38:25 AM] Alex Markov: i am in charge of accounting reorganization
[05/21/2007 09:38:30 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to figure out whay we are doing first
[05/21/2007 09:38:40 AM] Robert Douglas: before anyone is in charge of anything for the documnet stuff
[05/21/2007 09:38:45 AM] Alex Markov: this week i am meeting with our new business accountant and he is gonna setup quickbooks for us to work exactly liek we need it. so there will be new protocols
[05/21/2007 09:39:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wait
[05/21/2007 09:39:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to catch up
[05/21/2007 09:39:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert is being a fuckhead
[05/21/2007 09:39:24 AM] Alex Markov: no. brian is in charge of it. plain and simple. the whole "we are all in charge of it" philosophy does not work., did u ever hear of the phrase "too many cooks in one kitchen?"
[05/21/2007 09:39:36 AM] Robert Douglas: we're not going to do shit until we talk about it
[05/21/2007 09:39:43 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe brian wont even do anything, maybe sugar will do it all
[05/21/2007 09:39:48 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to discuss it first
[05/21/2007 09:39:50 AM] Robert Douglas: find out the best option
[05/21/2007 09:39:52 AM] Robert Douglas: then proceed
[05/21/2007 09:40:14 AM] Alex Markov: brian is in charge of researching the best solution. presenting it to us. and then implementing it and writing up documenetantion and protocols for it
[05/21/2007 09:40:28 AM] Robert Douglas: we all need to help with company setup
[05/21/2007 09:40:36 AM] Alex Markov: in other companies. projects are handed out to managers who are right for them and those who are avaialble
[05/21/2007 09:40:39 AM] Robert Douglas: because 1 more head on the issue, makes for a better outcome
[05/21/2007 09:40:49 AM] Alex Markov: all heads will be invovled in each internal project
[05/21/2007 09:41:03 AM] Alex Markov: HOWEVER.... each itnenral project will have a project manager
[05/21/2007 09:41:12 AM] Alex Markov: who is in charge of guiding the project forward
[05/21/2007 09:41:30 AM] Alex Markov: brian right now does not have a intenral project that he is managing...
[05/21/2007 09:41:36 AM] Alex Markov: so this is his first intenral project
[05/21/2007 09:41:46 AM] Robert Douglas: he can come up with the ideas
[05/21/2007 09:41:47 AM] Alex Markov: this is my delegation as the business manager
[05/21/2007 09:41:52 AM] Robert Douglas: but he might not be the person to implement it
[05/21/2007 09:41:57 AM] Robert Douglas: because we might not use SVN
[05/21/2007 09:42:00 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to look at all options first
[05/21/2007 09:42:01 AM] Alex Markov: that is fine
[05/21/2007 09:42:05 AM] Robert Douglas: and EVERYONE needs to provide input
[05/21/2007 09:42:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes so accept my fucking file transfer
[05/21/2007 09:42:11 AM] Alex Markov: joe schmo in india can implement it
[05/21/2007 09:42:19 AM] Alex Markov: however brian is in charge of coordinating the implementation
[05/21/2007 09:42:28 AM] Robert Douglas: if it was svn, brian will do it
[05/21/2007 09:42:41 AM] Alex Markov: it doenst matter who does it!!!!!! holy shit bobby. 
[05/21/2007 09:42:49 AM] Alex Markov: brian is in charge of picking who does it
[05/21/2007 09:42:51 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm telling u brian will do the SVN
[05/21/2007 09:42:54 AM] Robert Douglas: he wants to do it
[05/21/2007 09:42:59 AM] Robert Douglas: he's planned it out
[05/21/2007 09:43:05 AM] Robert Douglas: this is assuming that is the route we're gunna take
[05/21/2007 09:43:10 AM] Alex Markov: and to make sure it is done right. and to presenting it to the other partners of the firm
[05/21/2007 09:43:23 AM] Robert Douglas: right, i told him last night to put something together
[05/21/2007 09:43:40 AM] Alex Markov: i told him alst week. he is the PM of the Documenet management project. thats it
[05/21/2007 09:44:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can we continue to discuss the website development?
[05/21/2007 09:44:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i believe that is next on the list

[05/21/2007 09:46:43 AM] Alex Markov: chain of command is important in a effecient organization
[05/21/2007 09:46:46 AM] Robert Douglas: well, within reason, u guys need to provide input for everything every step of the way
[05/21/2007 09:46:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, let me know if you need any deving from me on it robert

[05/21/2007 09:47:31 AM] Robert Douglas: as in zero database work

[05/21/2007 09:47:52 AM] Robert Douglas: it will be similar tot he setupi have for dev.ffz
[05/21/2007 09:48:10 AM] Robert Douglas: it isnt located anywhere yet
[05/21/2007 09:48:13 AM] Alex Markov: ok bobby. u understand u are in charge of RPS Website Project
[05/21/2007 09:48:15 AM] Robert Douglas: we're still working on some template stuff
[05/21/2007 09:48:21 AM] Alex Markov: so now we erach have a big intenral project
[05/21/2007 09:48:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also are you moving all the content from your old site over to it?
[05/21/2007 09:48:23 AM] Alex Markov: each
[05/21/2007 09:48:30 AM] Alex Markov: no we have new content
[05/21/2007 09:48:37 AM] Alex Markov: we are working on for like 6 months now
[05/21/2007 09:48:39 AM] Robert Douglas: you can call me PM for RPS website project, but u and brian will still help out, provide ideas, etc..
[05/21/2007 09:49:06 AM] Robert Douglas: i dont care what the "title" is, everyone is still going to help to the best of their ability to make sure it is done and it is done right
[05/21/2007 09:49:09 AM] Alex Markov: robert. we will. but is your job to demand input from us at various stages
[05/21/2007 09:49:15 AM] Alex Markov: agreed
[05/21/2007 09:49:18 AM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[05/21/2007 09:49:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert, you have a lot of great content on your big bobs site, i would love to see some of that included in the new site
[05/21/2007 09:49:31 AM] Robert Douglas: brb eye drops
[05/21/2007 09:49:53 AM] Alex Markov: that is what we have been doing. we are moving his content over and adding to it
[05/21/2007 09:49:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we seriously need to talk less about who is in charge of what and more about how its going to get done
[05/21/2007 09:50:13 AM] Alex Markov: bobby.... u need to give me a deadline to finish the RPS text writeups
[05/21/2007 09:50:31 AM] Alex Markov: brian. please trust me. this is going to be our new organizational structure
[05/21/2007 09:50:43 AM] Alex Markov: this is going to guide every single thing we do
[05/21/2007 09:51:04 AM] Robert Douglas: back
[05/21/2007 09:51:14 AM] Robert Douglas: some of the stuff on my curent site will be moved over to the new one
[05/21/2007 09:51:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: alex that isn't the point i was trying to make, you and robert go back and forth on who has to tell eachother what to do, and then we still have to discuss what has to be done
[05/21/2007 09:51:22 AM] Robert Douglas: but i agree with the entire "title" idea
[05/21/2007 09:51:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my point is, you said "robert is pm for rps site now" that should be the fucking end of it
[05/21/2007 09:51:38 AM] Robert Douglas: imo it just wastes time to say "i'm gunna be PM of rps website"
[05/21/2007 09:51:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we all know we all have to give input
[05/21/2007 09:51:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is all a common theme here
[05/21/2007 09:51:54 AM] Alex Markov: yes well bobby just needs to stop questioning the decisions of the currnetly acting business manager
[05/21/2007 09:51:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we know those
[05/21/2007 09:52:00 AM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/21/2007 09:52:01 AM] Robert Douglas: we're all the business managers
[05/21/2007 09:52:09 AM] Robert Douglas: well,u and me
[05/21/2007 09:52:12 AM] Robert Douglas: brian is just starting out
[05/21/2007 09:52:27 AM] Alex Markov: NO. every company has 1 business amnager. his job is to oversee all day to day operations. all things go through the business manager
[05/21/2007 09:52:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we all manage some part of the business, it doesn't matter, let us continue
[05/21/2007 09:52:43 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but we are partners, so there is no single person right now
[05/21/2007 09:52:43 AM] Alex Markov: u dont seem to understand the concept
[05/21/2007 09:52:53 AM] Alex Markov: yes there is. in the web design kit and everybody i talk to
[05/21/2007 09:52:58 AM] Alex Markov: they tell me we need to hire 1 business manager
[05/21/2007 09:53:01 AM] Robert Douglas: anything new to the company, needs to get accepted by the partners
[05/21/2007 09:53:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh for gods sakes
[05/21/2007 09:53:08 AM] Robert Douglas: brian, shhh
[05/21/2007 09:53:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert will you let the rest of us know when you get a dev.rp-s site set up?
[05/21/2007 09:53:27 AM] Robert Douglas: of course
[05/21/2007 09:53:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: excellent
[05/21/2007 09:53:38 AM] Alex Markov: bobby... this is the right path for us. trust me please.
[05/21/2007 09:53:50 AM] Alex Markov: eventually we will hire a professional business manager
[05/21/2007 09:53:58 AM] Alex Markov: right now i will do it for the next 5months. u can do it after that
[05/21/2007 09:54:01 AM] Robert Douglas: in the future, when we are completely operational, i think it might be good to have a single person make decisions
[05/21/2007 09:54:11 AM] Alex Markov: its not decisions.
