Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Group Conversation 12351): Mon Jul 16 12:57:47 2007
[07/16/2007 12:58:06 PM] Robert Douglas: u would want to do last name and time stamp though too, so if you have two Smiths sign up, you can tell the difference based on the time they submitted their info to the DB, and the time they paid via PP
[07/16/2007 12:58:18 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant drop the project, we need to work out all of the bugs
[07/16/2007 12:58:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: the project protocol needs to be changed so that if they aren't using our hosting, we don't offer them services that don't exist on their own host's server
[07/16/2007 12:59:20 PM] Robert Douglas: the only thing that doesnt work is the cron
[07/16/2007 01:08:07 PM] Alex Markov: guys...briefly... one of my good friends needs to figure out how to: 
[07/16/2007 01:08:12 PM] Alex Markov: I want to make a link open up in it's own window, but not open up in it's own tab in firefox
[07/16/2007 01:08:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: right click the link]
[07/16/2007 01:08:31 PM] Alex Markov: nono like from the code side
[07/16/2007 01:09:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: not possible
[07/16/2007 01:09:35 PM] Alex Markov: why. i feel like i have seen windows open up in new ff windows
[07/16/2007 01:09:46 PM] Alex Markov: or rather links open in separate ff window
[07/16/2007 01:10:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: if the user sets it to always open in a new tab it will always do that
[07/16/2007 01:10:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: otherwise you set target="_blank" on a link in the code
[07/16/2007 01:10:27 PM] Alex Markov: bobby do u know?
[07/16/2007 01:10:31 PM] Robert Douglas: target="_blank"
[07/16/2007 01:10:44 PM] Alex Markov: thanks
[07/16/2007 01:10:55 PM] Alex Markov: this guy just sent me an invite to an exclusive invite only torrent community
[07/16/2007 01:10:57 PM] Alex Markov: its rly crazy
[07/16/2007 01:11:05 PM] Alex Markov: he said it doesnt do it
[07/16/2007 01:11:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: what community?
[07/16/2007 01:11:14 PM] Alex Markov: oink
[07/16/2007 01:12:10 PM] Alex Markov: he said the blank command is not the right one
[07/16/2007 01:12:14 PM] Alex Markov: anything else he can try?
[07/16/2007 01:13:48 PM] Robert Douglas: blank is correct
[07/16/2007 01:14:11 PM] Robert Douglas: by setting a link to be target="_blank" it will tell the browser to open the link in a new window
[07/16/2007 01:14:26 PM] Robert Douglas: if the browser has popup blockers installed, then it may not work, and instead will stop it from opening in a new window
[07/16/2007 01:14:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: it won't do a new window if the user specifed always open in a new tab
[07/16/2007 01:14:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: popup blockers don't block links that you click
[07/16/2007 01:14:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: only javascripts
[07/16/2007 01:15:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats excluding javascripts called from the href="" value

[07/16/2007 01:19:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: they have 3 fucking pages of documentation
[07/16/2007 01:20:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: its the worst api i've ever seen
[07/16/2007 01:20:10 PM] Alex Markov: :(

[07/16/2007 01:20:55 PM] Alex Markov: are u capable of finishing it? it would be ebst if u did siunce u designed it to begin with
[07/16/2007 01:22:47 PM] Robert Douglas: first, PP isn't well documented, and this is Brian's first time using PP, secondly, Brian isn't at home, so it is hard to do dev over a crappy internet connection
[07/16/2007 01:22:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i won't be able to implement a new system for another 2 weeks
[07/16/2007 01:22:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i agree, we should just pay someone else to finish it up
