[06/11/2007 01:17:23 PM] Alex Markov: SVN
[06/11/2007 01:17:33 PM] Alex Markov: Create a user account on server to hold the SVN files, and Websvn site.  
Layout a general file structure to meet our current needs.  
Configure access to each individual repository.  

[06/11/2007 01:17:43 PM] Alex Markov: that is the next step for the SVN bobby
[06/11/2007 01:17:57 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, before we make a user, we need to find out what address we want to use
[06/11/2007 01:18:02 PM] Robert Douglas: such as svn.rp-s.com
[06/11/2007 01:18:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i suggest we do something that is not so common
[06/11/2007 01:18:09 PM] Alex Markov: doc.rp-s.com
[06/11/2007 01:18:19 PM] Alex Markov: ok good point
[06/11/2007 01:18:37 PM] Alex Markov: docs.rp-s.com sounds sweet tho
[06/11/2007 01:18:44 PM] Robert Douglas: we have 2 main issues the svn is going to fix, the document manager, and the websites
[06/11/2007 01:18:57 PM] Robert Douglas: ws.rp-s.com
[06/11/2007 01:19:01 PM] Robert Douglas: docs.rp-s.com
[06/11/2007 01:19:06 PM] Alex Markov: yes we need to make a protocol in all our sites that we have the dev.domain.com thing
[06/11/2007 01:19:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds fine
[06/11/2007 01:19:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm also not sure which one we're going to roll out with first
[06/11/2007 01:19:24 PM] Robert Douglas: didn't we conclude that the website svn is more important right now/
[06/11/2007 01:20:03 PM] Alex Markov: im gonna say this right now... i am not using sugar docs. it is sooooo slow. i think eventually... we should have sugar pull all docs from the svn into itself automatically. but right now sugar docs is very under developed
[06/11/2007 01:20:06 PM] Alex Markov: and is slow as fuck
[06/11/2007 01:20:41 PM] Alex Markov: so we gonna use svn docs full force for now.
[06/11/2007 01:21:20 PM] Alex Markov: so i say we roll out with both at same time
[06/11/2007 01:21:45 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to have to detail out the directories we want fort he doc manager
[06/11/2007 01:21:48 PM] Alex Markov: i think it should be code.rp-s.com and docs.rp-s.com
[06/11/2007 01:21:56 PM] Alex Markov: we will
[06/11/2007 01:22:05 PM] Alex Markov: i will do that
