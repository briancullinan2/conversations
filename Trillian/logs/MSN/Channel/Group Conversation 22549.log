[05/22/2007 09:08:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah that takes 2 calls
[05/22/2007 09:09:06 AM] Robert Douglas: assuming u pickup, hopefuly it should only take 1 or 2
[05/22/2007 09:09:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: especially if i cancel it twice
[05/22/2007 09:09:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then he should know i am coming and must be in a place i can't answer
[05/22/2007 09:09:28 AM] Robert Douglas: but when u dont pickup, we assume that you didnt wake up
[05/22/2007 09:09:45 AM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt say it was cancelled
[05/22/2007 09:09:45 AM] Alex Markov: then we need a system
[05/22/2007 09:09:45 AM] Robert Douglas: it just rings normally
[05/22/2007 09:09:59 AM] Robert Douglas: u could have picke dup the phone, and not said anything, then walked out of the room to say hang on
[05/22/2007 09:10:07 AM] Robert Douglas: that would have worked, right?
[05/22/2007 09:10:52 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Meetings&record=126ac0a2-51f3-339b-0f7f-4651df7127f1&offset=1&stamp=1179850021091714800)http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?action=DetailView&module=Meetings&record=126ac0a2-51f3-339b-0f7f-4651df7127f1&offset=1&stamp=1179850021091714800
[05/22/2007 09:11:01 AM] Robert Douglas: there's a link to the meeting
[05/22/2007 09:11:28 AM] Robert Douglas: just do that int he future brian, so nobody has to keep calling and wondering where u are at
[05/22/2007 09:12:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just for the future i will not answer my phone in the bedroom, luckily for you i was on my way out
[05/22/2007 09:13:01 AM] Robert Douglas: that's fine, there are certain times where we cant answer calls
[05/22/2007 09:13:17 AM] Robert Douglas: but if the person calls back a 2nd time,that means you should be  already walking to a spot where u can pick it up
[05/22/2007 09:13:26 AM] Robert Douglas: when i'm in  amovie, and alex calls once, i ignore it
[05/22/2007 09:13:46 AM] Robert Douglas: when he calls a 2nd time, i leave my chair and walk outside the movie to talk to him
[05/22/2007 09:13:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i understand that
[05/22/2007 09:13:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and already told you that i would do that
[05/22/2007 09:14:15 AM] Alex Markov: so no one should get mad when they get a few phone calls. i think everyone should jsut carry their phone on them on vibrate
[05/22/2007 09:14:27 AM] Alex Markov: there have been emergencies that we msut respond to quickly
[05/22/2007 09:14:51 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, then np
[05/22/2007 09:15:02 AM] Robert Douglas: did u guys pull up the meeting agenda?
[05/22/2007 09:15:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2007 09:15:23 AM] Robert Douglas: refresh the page again
[05/22/2007 09:15:30 AM] Robert Douglas: i added an "if time" piece
[05/22/2007 09:16:15 AM] Robert Douglas: let's goo
[05/22/2007 09:16:22 AM] Robert Douglas: am i the only one here paying attention wtf
[05/22/2007 09:16:33 AM] Alex Markov: this is a starter list of BM responsibilities
[05/22/2007 09:16:34 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=158#post158)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=158#post158
[05/22/2007 09:16:44 AM] Alex Markov: we will add to it
[05/22/2007 09:16:55 AM] Alex Markov: eventually maybe bobby will try the BM
[05/22/2007 09:16:55 AM] Alex Markov: spot
[05/22/2007 09:17:41 AM] Robert Douglas: how does the BM delegate internal projects
[05/22/2007 09:17:46 AM] Robert Douglas: everything else i think is good 100%
[05/22/2007 09:18:12 AM] Alex Markov: the BM will keep track of everything that needs to be done for the business. and will delegate it to a department or a staff member
[05/22/2007 09:18:22 AM] Alex Markov: often alot of thigns will automatically be handled by departments
[05/22/2007 09:18:33 AM] Alex Markov: like wbe hositng issues will be handled by the web hosting department that is run by bobby
[05/22/2007 09:18:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all makes sense
[05/22/2007 09:18:59 AM] Alex Markov: basically this gives us a position of day to day leadership
[05/22/2007 09:19:04 AM] Alex Markov: even if i have done that for a while
[05/22/2007 09:19:11 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/22/2007 09:19:17 AM] Alex Markov: we need to officially make that positon now and develop it
[05/22/2007 09:19:19 AM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[05/22/2007 09:19:21 AM] Alex Markov: also i made that forum
[05/22/2007 09:19:29 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=119)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=119
[05/22/2007 09:19:36 AM] Robert Douglas: title should be Business Manager (BM)
[05/22/2007 09:19:48 AM] Robert Douglas: because we want the actual name of the poosition to be listed alphabetically
[05/22/2007 09:19:51 AM] Alex Markov: i forget where i read this... some business book... but we eventualyl ened to outline every responsibility of every positon
[05/22/2007 09:20:11 AM] Alex Markov: done
[05/22/2007 09:20:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: priobably a good idea
[05/22/2007 09:20:26 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, it is good to know what your responsibilities are
[05/22/2007 09:20:27 AM] Alex Markov: because when we want to hire someone.... it would be good that everything is spelled out right there
[05/22/2007 09:20:29 AM] Robert Douglas: k, BM sounds good
[05/22/2007 09:20:44 AM] Robert Douglas: -Handling day to day issues: The BM will oversee day to day meetings.
[05/22/2007 09:20:53 AM] Robert Douglas: day to day meetings? or issues?
[05/22/2007 09:20:53 AM] Alex Markov: that is good also incase we need to fire someone. if the repsonsibilites are listed.... and they dont meet threm.... they cant sue us if we fire them
[05/22/2007 09:20:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i think these thing should be a little more extensive then your thread alex
[05/22/2007 09:21:00 AM] Robert Douglas: because you already list "-Scheduling company meetings"
[05/22/2007 09:21:15 AM] Alex Markov: yes i am making that correcton bobby
[05/22/2007 09:21:19 AM] Robert Douglas: k
