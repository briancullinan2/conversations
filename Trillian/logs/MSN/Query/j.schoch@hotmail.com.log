[09/26/2007 07:02:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that although physics is the true science, chemistry is the application of physics on a high scale
[09/26/2007 07:03:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: its like a low level computer language to a high level language respectively
[09/26/2007 07:04:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think richard would enjoy that realization, he's a big physics guy, considered majoring in it
[09/26/2007 07:04:27 PM] Jenna Schoch: wow, that would be so much work

[10/06/2007 09:17:40 PM] Jenna Schoch: kk
[10/06/2007 09:18:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want you to know not to take that comment that made you so upset so personally
[10/06/2007 09:18:54 PM] Jenna Schoch: well let me explain myself
[10/06/2007 09:19:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, let me
[10/06/2007 09:19:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are few people that i am attracted to
[10/06/2007 09:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: sexually
[10/06/2007 09:20:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that's what is preventing me from being a slut
[10/06/2007 09:20:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i think you were just drunk, and everyone gets over emotional
[10/06/2007 09:20:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am sorry for making a crude comment
[10/06/2007 09:20:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you are sorry for overreacting
[10/06/2007 09:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats all that is needed
[10/06/2007 09:21:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: no hard feelings
[10/06/2007 09:23:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: the time you spend the night and we fooled around was wonderful
[10/06/2007 09:23:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't want that to be the object of our relationship
[10/06/2007 09:24:10 PM] Jenna Schoch: well either do i
[10/06/2007 09:24:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't think we should act like that again

[10/06/2007 09:25:04 PM] Jenna Schoch: thats fine, sounds good to me

[10/06/2007 09:34:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats good that you turned it up

[10/06/2007 10:20:23 PM] Jenna Schoch: i remebr you taking them off :P
[10/06/2007 10:20:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha i remember you being pretty willing to let me
[10/06/2007 10:20:58 PM] Jenna Schoch: lol, never said I objected
[10/06/2007 10:21:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: you remember messing around with keifer
[10/06/2007 10:21:33 PM] Jenna Schoch: yeah lol. that was werid. it was like both of you
[10/06/2007 10:21:38 PM] Jenna Schoch: at the same time
[10/06/2007 10:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: dream come true
[10/06/2007 10:21:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: but keifer has a girlfriend
[10/06/2007 10:22:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was disappointed in him
[10/06/2007 10:22:16 PM] Jenna Schoch: i know i felt so bad, she was like throwing up and he was in there with us
[10/06/2007 10:23:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: she takes a lot of shit from keifer
[10/06/2007 10:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and this would certainly set her over the edge if she ever found out
[10/06/2007 10:23:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are not right together
[10/06/2007 10:23:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't tell her
[10/06/2007 10:23:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and neither should you
[10/06/2007 10:23:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: their relationship will end in due time
[10/06/2007 10:23:54 PM] Jenna Schoch: i dont talk to her anyway
[10/06/2007 10:24:06 PM] Jenna Schoch: plus Its not my right to tell her
[10/06/2007 10:24:53 PM] Jenna Schoch: i really dont know how she does put up with it though, I wouldnt
[10/06/2007 10:25:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: if she is your friend, it is your right
[10/06/2007 10:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but not necissarily the best thing to do
[10/06/2007 10:26:48 PM] Jenna Schoch: well i dont think we're friends. the only times ive ever huung out with her at those two time at your house. lol
[10/06/2007 11:04:31 PM] Jenna Schoch: mmm food
[10/06/2007 11:05:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: what food?
[10/06/2007 11:05:34 PM] Jenna Schoch: spaghetti
[10/06/2007 11:05:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: good stuff
[10/06/2007 11:05:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: kinda late though don't you think?
[10/06/2007 11:06:26 PM] Jenna Schoch: nah, havent eaten dinner yet since ive been home from work.
[10/06/2007 11:08:22 PM] Jenna Schoch: besides, its hard to sleep when youre hungry
[10/06/2007 11:10:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should kill people for money
[10/06/2007 11:10:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be so much fun
[10/06/2007 11:10:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i could kill someone
[10/06/2007 11:11:03 PM] Jenna Schoch: it would take a lot
[10/06/2007 11:11:07 PM] Jenna Schoch: i never could
[10/06/2007 11:11:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know how in movies when people always hesitate and start crying when the procrastinator says "do it"
[10/06/2007 11:11:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could do it
[10/06/2007 11:11:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wouldn't hesitate
[10/06/2007 11:11:40 PM] Jenna Schoch: i dont think so
[10/06/2007 11:11:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would think about it differently
[10/06/2007 11:12:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could do it without thinking
[10/06/2007 11:12:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: like when you swallow something spicy and it doesn't affect you
[10/06/2007 11:12:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: just don't think about it
[10/06/2007 11:12:41 PM] Jenna Schoch: but afterwords you would
[10/06/2007 11:12:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe
[10/06/2007 11:12:54 PM] Jenna Schoch: and how would you justify taking someone elses life
[10/06/2007 11:13:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i could only do it once
[10/06/2007 11:13:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it would effect me deeply afterwards
[10/06/2007 11:13:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but at the time, it would be self defence
[10/06/2007 11:13:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: or killing someone that kills other people
[10/06/2007 11:13:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't always murder
[10/06/2007 11:13:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes it can be just
[10/06/2007 11:14:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: even in the bible
[10/06/2007 11:14:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: people don't think so
[10/06/2007 11:14:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what about the crusades?
[10/06/2007 11:14:30 PM] Jenna Schoch: i dont know, no matter the person or what theyve done, i dont think anyone deserves it
[10/06/2007 11:14:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not saying they deserve it
[10/06/2007 11:15:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but sometimes jail is too good for them
[10/06/2007 11:15:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but your right, they don't deserve it
[10/06/2007 11:15:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the other people that a person could harm deserve the justice
[10/06/2007 11:16:09 PM] Jenna Schoch: very true. but say they killed someone. if you kill them they dont learn their lesson
[10/06/2007 11:16:12 PM] Jenna Schoch: they just die
[10/06/2007 11:16:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: other people deserve to live, and i had to kill someone for a just cause, i would do it
[10/06/2007 11:16:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's true
[10/06/2007 11:16:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if they kill lots of people
[10/06/2007 11:16:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: or intend to kill more people
[10/06/2007 11:16:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: they should die, for the sake of others
[10/06/2007 11:16:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i could do it
[10/06/2007 11:16:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: without thinking
[10/06/2007 11:17:43 PM] Jenna Schoch: maybe, but i dont think you could deal with it
[10/06/2007 11:17:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: well there is only one way to find out
[10/06/2007 11:18:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe i will never know
[10/06/2007 11:18:20 PM] Jenna Schoch: i hope not lol
[10/06/2007 11:18:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it's pretty unlikely that i would ever be in a situation where i had to kill to save the lives of others
[10/06/2007 11:19:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was just thinking about all this because of the show
[10/06/2007 11:19:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: he kills people that intend to kill others
[10/06/2007 11:19:44 PM] Jenna Schoch: i figured thats what brought it up
[10/06/2007 11:20:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: still an interesting thing to think about
