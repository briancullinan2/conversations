[06/02/2007 10:40:22 PM] Joanna Hicks: no, he is a christian who stuggles in certain areas, everybody does.  No christian is perfect and people need to get that through their head already

[06/02/2007 10:45:18 PM] Joanna Hicks: AHHH...he has this tough exterior that nobody understands.  I wish people knew the other side.  Well, i don't want to talk about it anymore so ttyl 
[06/02/2007 10:46:32 PM] WiseMaster: sry, i know he has a tough exterior, but its all for show, any one of us could take him in a fight, everyone has a soft side, but that doesn't change whether of not he has weak morals
[06/02/2007 10:46:48 PM] WiseMaster: and i think thats what is really the problem
[06/02/2007 10:47:47 PM] WiseMaster: i don't want to discourage you from living with us, i enjoy you being here, and i respect you very much, i just think you need to re-evaluate your relationship with him

[09/18/2007 04:46:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need your opinion
[09/18/2007 04:46:23 PM] Joanna Hicks: oh my gosh, I don't think so you guys just met like last week
[09/18/2007 04:46:36 PM] Joanna Hicks: At least start a relationship with her before you do that
[09/18/2007 04:46:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: you had sex with keifer pretty early, and i knew jenna since last year
[09/18/2007 04:46:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are friends
[09/18/2007 04:47:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that a good enough relationship
[09/18/2007 04:47:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[09/18/2007 04:47:25 PM] Joanna Hicks: You need to be a couple for a while before jumping into that
[09/18/2007 04:47:31 PM] Joanna Hicks: Ask her out on a date
[09/18/2007 04:47:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want a girlfriend
[09/18/2007 04:47:37 PM] Joanna Hicks: ?
[09/18/2007 04:47:41 PM] Joanna Hicks: I thought you were lonely
[09/18/2007 04:47:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, i have lots of options
[09/18/2007 04:48:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just have to figure out which one to assk
[09/18/2007 04:48:03 PM] Brian Cullinan:  first
[09/18/2007 04:48:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking linux keyboards
[09/18/2007 04:48:50 PM] Joanna Hicks: well then ask one out on a date and if it develops into something meaningful then you might look into going farther
[09/18/2007 04:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: its further, and i don't want a girlfriend
[09/18/2007 04:49:40 PM] Joanna Hicks: I meant to say farther not further...two separate words
[09/18/2007 04:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess either one works grammatically, similar definitions
[09/18/2007 04:50:54 PM] Joanna Hicks: yep
[09/18/2007 04:51:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should just keep meeting girls, like keifer did before he met you
[09/18/2007 04:51:18 PM] Joanna Hicks: soo basically it's up to you two but as far as my opinion....date her first
[09/18/2007 04:51:31 PM] Joanna Hicks: Sounds good
[09/18/2007 04:51:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: negative, i'm not that attracted to her, i just think shes cute, and she has a nice body
[09/18/2007 04:52:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should get high this weekend
[09/18/2007 04:52:16 PM] Joanna Hicks: no way!
[09/18/2007 04:52:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are boring
[09/18/2007 04:52:46 PM] Joanna Hicks: my brother does that and he says it's easy to get hooked
[09/18/2007 04:53:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only want to try it once, so i need someone i can trust to do it with me so we can all make sure we don't get addicted
[09/18/2007 04:54:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is OK trent will do it with me
[09/18/2007 04:54:24 PM] Joanna Hicks: lol I can't, I already see how it messed up my brother I will not do that
[09/18/2007 04:54:35 PM] Joanna Hicks: ...ok
[09/18/2007 04:54:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a difference between experiencing something, and being a dumbass
[09/18/2007 04:55:45 PM] Joanna Hicks: yes but everyone i know who does it says that they were hoooked after the first time of doing it b/c it makes you feel so good
[09/18/2007 04:55:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't even that bad for you, the only reason people think its bad and people get addicted is because its against the law, and the government is hypocritical, why is alcohol legal? its much more dangerous then pot and causes a lot more deaths
[09/18/2007 04:56:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: my friend jeffrey does it occasionally, but he's definitely not addicted
[09/18/2007 04:56:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: its no more of a risk then alcohol, so i guess its not for the weak minded
[09/18/2007 04:56:55 PM] Joanna Hicks: see it all depends on your body, some get addicted instantly others are never addicted. i'm not willing to risk being the first type
[09/18/2007 04:57:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: k

[04/28/2008 10:39:36 PM] Joanna Hicks: u guys r both retarded
[04/28/2008 10:39:45 PM] Joanna Hicks: ya he said something about that
[04/28/2008 10:40:08 PM] Joanna Hicks: Something about you telling him not to flirt b/c she has a gf and then doing it yourself, bla blabla
[04/28/2008 10:41:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah exactly, blah blah blah
[04/28/2008 10:41:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: he totally missed the point
[04/28/2008 10:41:54 PM] Joanna Hicks: i think he got it, that he shouldnt in the first place b/c of me.  His beef is with u still doing it knowing she has a bf
[04/28/2008 10:42:21 PM] Joanna Hicks: I think u and her have problems.  She shouldnt put herself in that position and u shouldnt act on your feelings
[04/28/2008 10:42:36 PM] Joanna Hicks: If she really wants to be with u than she needs to break up with her bf before she cheats
[04/28/2008 10:42:43 PM] Joanna Hicks: u know what i mean?
[04/28/2008 10:44:56 PM] Joanna Hicks: I hate the whole situation to be honest

[04/28/2008 10:56:27 PM] Joanna Hicks: thanks
[04/28/2008 10:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i wish that he had left my interations with crystal alone

[04/28/2008 11:02:58 PM] Joanna Hicks: Did he kiss her the night we kissed?
[04/28/2008 11:06:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think he kissed her?
[04/28/2008 11:06:16 PM] Joanna Hicks: I have no idea

[04/28/2008 11:10:13 PM] Joanna Hicks: why did she stay there and what happened?
[04/28/2008 11:10:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: she broke up with radar and was emotionally unstable

[04/28/2008 11:12:50 PM] Joanna Hicks: BRIAN I have to at least talk to him about it, i cant pretend everything is fine

[04/28/2008 11:19:50 PM] Joanna Hicks: yet dave thought he had, and I appreciate him looking out for me, I really need someone like him in my life. But it put a huge strain on our relationship and it ended up being false
[04/28/2008 11:20:06 PM] Joanna Hicks: So make sure that stuff you guys find out, is truth before u tell me. Please

[04/28/2008 11:53:21 PM] Joanna Hicks: k so she is basically in love with him, she laid it all out a few months ago, she went to see him over the summer, when she was taking off her clothes that one night i was sick he went in and saw her naked and touched her-i dont know the details, before we were together they made out...
[04/28/2008 11:54:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds about right
[04/28/2008 11:56:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i talked to him about when you and i kissed
[04/28/2008 11:56:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: he told her he kissed jenna that night
[04/28/2008 11:57:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i asked "you just wanted me to kiss joanna so that you had an excuse to kiss jenna"
[04/28/2008 11:57:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: he did that "heh yeah" thing that he does
[04/28/2008 11:58:30 PM] Joanna Hicks: oh
[04/28/2008 11:59:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: she spent the night with him when jenna brok up with radar
[04/28/2008 11:59:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: *broke
[04/29/2008 12:00:17 AM] Joanna Hicks: so how am i supposed to feel and talk to him about it when im not supposed to know
[04/29/2008 12:00:30 AM] Joanna Hicks: what did they do when she spent the night??
[04/29/2008 12:00:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: how do you really feel?
[04/29/2008 12:00:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure
[04/29/2008 12:01:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: crystal was over the other night and i was flirting with her
[04/29/2008 12:01:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: and he was massaging her feet, and he later admitted that he really liked her
[04/29/2008 12:02:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i told him to back off, and that he already has a girlfriend
[04/29/2008 12:03:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: but how do you feel about this?
[04/29/2008 12:03:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you upset?
[04/29/2008 12:03:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you not surpised?
[04/29/2008 12:03:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: *surprised?
[04/29/2008 12:03:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you angry?
[04/29/2008 12:04:22 AM] Joanna Hicks: i am upset, he told me he thought she was attractive and thats all
[04/29/2008 12:04:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you talking to Dave?
[04/29/2008 12:05:31 AM] Joanna Hicks: now i am
[04/29/2008 12:05:32 AM] Joanna Hicks: lol
[04/29/2008 12:06:08 AM] Joanna Hicks: i didnt see him online
[04/29/2008 12:06:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: ah
[04/29/2008 12:06:28 AM] Joanna Hicks: anyway, seriously how am i supposed to deal with this.  Its all messed up
[04/29/2008 12:07:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think you should decide if you can forgive and understand keifer's actions
[04/29/2008 12:07:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: if it is all ok, then i guess nothing else matters
[04/29/2008 12:08:16 AM] Joanna Hicks: u know its not OK
[04/29/2008 12:08:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but if you are upset about it, then i think you should really take the quality of your relationship into consideration
[04/29/2008 12:08:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't think it is going to stop
[04/29/2008 12:09:58 AM] Joanna Hicks: true but i dont want to make a mistake or accuse him of something untrue
[04/29/2008 12:10:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: then maybe you should ask him about all the stuff you heard from me
[04/29/2008 12:11:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: and if he admits to it, then you will know, if he denies everything then you have to decide who to believe
[04/29/2008 12:12:38 AM] Joanna Hicks: uuuggghhh
[04/29/2008 12:13:38 AM] Joanna Hicks: idk its hard to talk about those things, i always get weird
[04/29/2008 12:14:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry to make you feel weird, i just thought you should know
[04/29/2008 12:14:34 AM] Joanna Hicks: ya I want to know but I dont know what to do with information, unless I see if firsthand I dont know details, etc
[04/29/2008 12:15:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess you can just speculate and wait until you see it
[04/29/2008 12:18:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't know if he is going to hang out with jenna that much because he got some skin irritation from her
[04/29/2008 12:19:02 AM] Joanna Hicks: haha
[04/29/2008 12:19:18 AM] Joanna Hicks: no i dont want to wait until i see it, thats crap. I'll ask him
[04/29/2008 12:19:24 AM] Joanna Hicks: not sure when though
[04/29/2008 12:19:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: wait until it is convenient for both of you
[04/29/2008 12:20:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: like when you aren't into studying, or even after finals
[04/29/2008 12:30:44 AM] Joanna Hicks: i cant wait, he's leaving as soon as finals end
[04/29/2008 12:42:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i forgot to mention, keifer's interaction with crystal did stop at just the foot massage, he also told her he liked her a lot and wanted to be with her, it made her really uncomfortable and that is when i talked to him about backing off
