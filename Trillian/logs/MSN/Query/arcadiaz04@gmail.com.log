[04/19/2008 07:37:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty bad at math
[04/19/2008 07:38:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm bad at this because it's more programming than math
[04/19/2008 07:38:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have to model a coal loading station
[04/19/2008 07:38:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: its matlab kid stuff to you probably, though
[04/19/2008 07:39:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah programming comes pretty easy to us CS guys
[04/19/2008 07:45:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what is going on with you and steve
[04/19/2008 07:45:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys have been together for a while right?
[04/19/2008 07:45:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you don't mind my asking
[04/19/2008 07:45:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to answer
[04/19/2008 07:46:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry.. i was thinking about how to keep track of the number of trains in the station
[04/19/2008 07:47:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: just use a counter, when one arrives add 1, when one leaves subract 1
[04/19/2008 07:47:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can use variables in matlab right?
[04/19/2008 07:47:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: Well... i ccan't really get into right now, but we have been together for about 3.5 years now, and I'm just going through this "i'm bored of you and am not sure I like you" phase which we fear is not a phase
[04/19/2008 07:48:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know how you feel, i was like that with my last girlfriend towards the end of our relationship
[04/19/2008 07:49:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: its just tricky.. this problem
[04/19/2008 07:49:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: how long was that
[04/19/2008 07:49:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: we dated for over a year
[04/19/2008 07:50:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was probably the best relationship i've been in, and we still talk and get along pretty well, probably because we were always honest with each other
[04/19/2008 07:50:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[04/19/2008 07:51:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve is a really good guy, and you seem pretty nice too

[04/19/2008 10:15:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: Oh
[04/19/2008 10:16:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: I sometimes don't notice it I guess, but from what I hear, I'm weird all the time

[04/19/2008 10:20:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: *drinks whiskey*
[04/19/2008 10:20:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm not sure what you mean by "I am not sure how to interpret that"
[04/19/2008 10:21:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: [04/19/2008 10:17:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: and those who matter dont care, while those who care don't matter

[04/19/2008 10:22:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: You havent heard that saying? I guess it's supposed to be Those who mind, don't matter, and those who matter, don't mind
[04/19/2008 10:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope, never heard it before
[04/19/2008 10:23:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but then again you are the weird one

[04/19/2008 10:32:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: and I've given up on my program for the day
[04/19/2008 10:32:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool, you guys ready to watch a sweet movie?
[04/19/2008 10:33:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I got stuck because my for loop is going hour by hour, but it takes three hours to load a train, and while those three hours are happening its possible for other trains to come in and incur waiting costs

[04/19/2008 10:34:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh he has been, with organizing ideas... he is just not great at matlab and would do the algorithm a different way, but I am supposed to keep it simple enough for me to be able to have done it myself

[04/20/2008 02:19:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer does find you attractive, like a lot of guys do i am sure.  but he can't decide what he wants
[04/20/2008 02:19:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've developed quite a few crushes this school year... and then they just go away, but ive never had it that the guy has openly crushed on my back

[04/20/2008 02:21:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he doesn't treat her very well
[04/20/2008 02:22:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but she is to naive to realize this
[04/20/2008 02:22:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've never done anything behind steves back
[04/20/2008 02:22:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: besides hand touching

[04/20/2008 02:28:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't go to the bars much anymore, but when I do (he never comes) I have to limit myself to like 4 drinks and avoid situations where that can happen
[04/20/2008 02:30:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: So you download the Sunshine soundtrack?
[04/20/2008 02:30:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: I suggest the last 3 or 4...... but the others are kind of lame

[04/20/2008 05:20:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: They they should be in a mental institute; not a relationship.
[04/20/2008 05:20:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: did someone say that to you?
[04/20/2008 05:21:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: no.. its just always a possiblity... like my roommate has a guy friend who once had a girlfriend like that
[04/20/2008 05:22:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: then maybe they should both read me blog
[04/20/2008 05:27:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: so what are you doing now
[04/20/2008 05:29:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: eating dinner and watching johnny long's hacking hollywood
[04/20/2008 05:30:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: want to watch the fountain?
[04/20/2008 05:31:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are you doing right now?
[04/20/2008 05:36:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am going in on a pizza, which hasnt been ordered, and still working on my simulation... I'm trying to make sure the crew doesnt fill the tipple past its full capacity

[04/20/2008 05:38:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: like hours before
[04/20/2008 05:39:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: before bsg i usually clean and get ready
[04/20/2008 05:42:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just thought maybe then is a good time to watch the movie
[04/20/2008 05:44:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think all this talk regarding my attraction toward Keifer and/or you at the party has caused my boyfriend to decide to come to next friday's party
[04/20/2008 05:44:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't think he would have otherwise
[04/20/2008 05:45:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i should talk to him, maybe apologize for making things uneasy 
[04/20/2008 05:46:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know why people are attracted to keifer
[04/20/2008 05:47:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: he has a girlfriend that got uncomfortable and left early, how could another woman even want his hands on them
[04/20/2008 05:47:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides, i am so much better at foot massages
[04/20/2008 05:47:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha..
[04/20/2008 05:47:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i don't think you should talk to him
[04/20/2008 05:48:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: if I tell him I'm over it then he'll be over it
[04/20/2008 05:48:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: why WAS i attracted to Keifer?
[04/20/2008 05:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: good question
[04/20/2008 05:49:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: why was you attracted to keifer?
[04/20/2008 05:49:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think it's just that when someone with a penis pays a twinge of special attention to me, I ... 
[04/20/2008 05:49:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: like the feeling
[04/20/2008 05:50:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: unless it's too much attention, that I quickly lose the attraction
[04/20/2008 05:50:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: like David Smith and Keifer
[04/20/2008 05:50:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: *then
[04/20/2008 05:50:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i suppose that's understandable, but when if you went out with that penis and then it started paying even more attention to other girls?
[04/20/2008 05:51:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: I.. can't imagine going out with another penis
[04/20/2008 05:51:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: *what if
[04/20/2008 05:51:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: got it
[04/20/2008 05:51:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you ever been with another penis?
[04/20/2008 05:52:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: not during my current penis, but yes.. like freshman year
[04/20/2008 05:52:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: wait.. i never touched their penis
[04/20/2008 05:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't touch penises either

[04/20/2008 10:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: does he write legibly?
[04/20/2008 10:41:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/20/2008 10:41:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: not like Wilson
[04/20/2008 10:41:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i hate wilson
[04/20/2008 10:41:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw i like him
[04/20/2008 10:41:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think its a math major, non-math major thing
[04/20/2008 10:41:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: to like him or not like him
[04/20/2008 10:42:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: So I'd say try for Burch (or Birch?)
[04/20/2008 10:42:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't know of anyone else. I had St. Laurent for 473 but I'm guessing you are asking for 270 and I don't know if he teaches that
[04/20/2008 10:43:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: Burch
[04/20/2008 10:43:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: Burch
[04/20/2008 10:43:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: B. Burch
[04/20/2008 10:43:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: for sure
[04/20/2008 11:18:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: won't let me in that class
[04/20/2008 11:18:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: ask for an override?
[04/20/2008 11:18:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: he'll probably be okay with that
[04/20/2008 11:21:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i'll take something over
[04/20/2008 11:21:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like cs 136
[04/20/2008 11:21:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be easy
[04/20/2008 11:25:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dropped CS before I had to take that... now why would you take the same class twice?
[04/20/2008 11:25:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i have any replacement credits left
[04/20/2008 11:26:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can replace the grade because i got a C
[04/20/2008 11:26:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you know how many replacement credits a person can do in total?
[04/20/2008 11:26:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can replace EE188 Lab and increase my GPA!
[04/20/2008 11:26:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: by .01 pts
[04/20/2008 11:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can do 15 total
[04/20/2008 11:27:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am pretty close
[04/20/2008 11:27:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh. nice
[04/20/2008 11:27:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have 1 left
[04/20/2008 11:28:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i dropped chemistry twice, discrete math because i had wilson, and statistics because i hated the teaching style
[04/20/2008 11:28:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was totally novice
[04/20/2008 11:29:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry
[04/20/2008 11:29:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't stand math teachers
[04/20/2008 11:29:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you not drop them soon enough?
[04/20/2008 11:29:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i have W, and you can still replace W
[04/20/2008 11:30:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: o
[04/20/2008 11:30:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i am sticking with 11 credit
[04/20/2008 11:30:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: s
[04/20/2008 11:31:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: adding another would make my semester too full
[04/20/2008 11:31:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think I'm going to go back to my home now
[04/20/2008 11:33:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: I probably won't get back online

[04/22/2008 12:15:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you have a physical relationship with him?
[04/22/2008 12:16:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: I do

[04/22/2008 12:17:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you have similar beliefs in spirituality?
[04/22/2008 12:17:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: along the same lines, i'm a little less religious than he is
[04/22/2008 12:17:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/22/2008 12:17:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: you cant just jump to the next thing! having a physical relationship doesnt mean its necessarily a good one
[04/22/2008 12:18:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: ah
[04/22/2008 12:18:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/22/2008 12:18:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: when was the last time you got some?

[04/22/2008 12:18:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: he asked today but i said no cuz i had homework
[04/22/2008 12:18:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: it happens a lot
[04/22/2008 12:18:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: our sex drives are really mismatched
[04/22/2008 12:19:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: i've decreased and he's increased over time
[04/22/2008 12:19:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/22/2008 12:19:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe there is something physical that you don't like about him or the time you spend together?
[04/22/2008 12:20:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you spend time before and after the sex part being intimate?
[04/22/2008 12:20:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: he;s also has gotten a lot more clingy/needy and i have gotten a lot less clingy/needy, both making me a little turned off by him
[04/22/2008 12:20:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: half the time we do.. the other half im only kinda doing it to make him happy, and then I leave soon after
[04/22/2008 12:22:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/22/2008 12:22:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like the perfect girl for me
[04/22/2008 12:22:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: i hate clingy
[04/22/2008 12:23:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is off topic
[04/22/2008 12:23:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: so, maybe you could ask him to tease you a little
[04/22/2008 12:23:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: don't make it so easy
[04/22/2008 12:23:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: you have to talk to your partner about the things you like or don't like
[04/22/2008 12:23:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: also maybe you could try new things
[04/22/2008 12:24:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: things that make you both want to be around each other
[04/22/2008 12:24:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: shower sex is always good
[04/22/2008 12:24:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[04/22/2008 12:24:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: ever tried it?
[04/22/2008 12:24:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: he just sort of bothers me
[04/22/2008 12:24:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: shower sex,? sure!
[04/22/2008 12:25:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, see i was like that with my girlfriend, and she felt the same way about me towards the end of our relationship
[04/22/2008 12:25:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i had lost physical interest in her
[04/22/2008 12:25:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: she maybe put on a little weight and her body was less attractive
[04/22/2008 12:25:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you are both beautiful people
[04/22/2008 12:25:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that doesn't seem to be the problem
[04/22/2008 12:26:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah im still physically attracted
[04/22/2008 12:26:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is good
[04/22/2008 12:26:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: i am going to go boil some water if you don't mind
[04/22/2008 12:28:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe you guys could spend time together without it being limited to physical needyness
[04/22/2008 12:29:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: and its like most of the time we spend together is in his bed
[04/22/2008 12:29:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[04/22/2008 12:32:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: understandable

[04/22/2008 01:23:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: or are you talking about drinking glasses.. cuz then i'd feel dumb
[04/22/2008 01:23:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol no, seeing glasses
[04/22/2008 01:23:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: only for close up
[04/22/2008 01:24:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: mine are for far away, like driving at night and reading Dr. Wilson's hand writing on the board
[04/22/2008 01:24:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: it takes more than glasses to read his handwriting
[04/22/2008 01:25:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like if you were going to be a teacher, you would learn how to write legibly 
[04/22/2008 01:29:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: did he ever tell you why he writes sloppy?
[04/22/2008 01:29:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: He wants people to ask questions... and asking what something says is kind of a question enough for him
[04/22/2008 01:30:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: omg
[04/22/2008 01:30:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: what a horrible teacher
[04/22/2008 01:30:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: he wouldn't get away with that in the CS department

[04/22/2008 02:48:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: I guess you don't have to answer that
[04/22/2008 02:49:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: just that you don't seem to like to be tied down
[04/22/2008 02:49:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: you seemed maybe a little disappointed when steve was coming to babysit you at the party
[04/22/2008 02:57:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: honestly i was disappointed, but then i felt guilty for not wanting him to be there for the wrong reasons
[04/22/2008 02:57:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: what was the wrong reason?
[04/22/2008 02:57:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: one that i discussed in my blog entry?
[04/22/2008 02:59:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: I..... 
[04/22/2008 02:59:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: think so
[04/22/2008 03:00:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: you remind me to much of my ex-girlfriend towards the end of our relationship

[04/22/2008 03:01:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am making a sweet shell
[04/22/2008 03:01:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: for some reason, compatibility when it comes to money is very important to me, and I know Steve and I are very compatible in that sense
[04/22/2008 03:01:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: and then theres other more practical things that make me want to stay with him
[04/22/2008 03:01:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: sounds sweet
[04/22/2008 03:04:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: the wrong reason is that
[04/22/2008 03:04:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: last friday
[04/22/2008 03:04:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: if you had said stay, I would have stayed.
[04/22/2008 03:05:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: believe me i was tempted, but i knew you were kind of with steve, so i would never betray another guy like that
[04/22/2008 03:05:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: ya
[04/22/2008 03:06:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: my best friend in highschool did that to me with my first girlfriend
[04/22/2008 03:06:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i'll be honest, it hurt, he is not my best friend anymore as you can imagine
[04/22/2008 03:06:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: yea
[04/22/2008 03:06:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i kind of have a thing against dating girls that went out with guys that i know
[04/22/2008 03:06:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: i wouldn't think you'd do that.

[04/23/2008 08:44:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: well

[04/23/2008 08:44:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: so he is looking for a scapegoat, if you will
[04/23/2008 08:44:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: i asked him if he has ever done anything behind his gfs back aside from foot massaging... and he said no...

[04/23/2008 08:45:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha okay. I didnt say anything.. well i asked if he was capable

[04/24/2008 11:01:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: ohhhh right, probably because i am downloading stuff

[04/24/2008 11:06:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: not to burst your bubble, but....
[04/24/2008 11:07:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't think  lim--> sin(x )/1  exists
[04/24/2008 11:07:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: as x approaches pi
[04/24/2008 11:08:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: you got me there
[04/24/2008 11:08:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i leave that part out
[04/24/2008 11:08:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: too hard to do subscript in IM
[04/24/2008 11:08:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i will be more specific from now on
[04/24/2008 11:08:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the +limit is still one even if x approaches infinity
[04/24/2008 11:09:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-P
[04/24/2008 11:09:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you are way better at math then me
[04/24/2008 11:09:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: but sin( x) as x approaches infinity doesnt tend towards any number
[04/24/2008 11:10:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/24/2008 11:10:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are totally right
[04/24/2008 11:10:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to go drink more beer

[04/24/2008 11:10:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am 100% bachelor
[04/24/2008 11:11:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the way i like it
[04/24/2008 11:11:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: I thought maybe it was possible you got one in the last 72 hours
[04/24/2008 11:11:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey!
[04/24/2008 11:11:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's good
[04/24/2008 11:11:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: you know what you want

[04/24/2008 11:28:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: this happened recently
[04/24/2008 11:28:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: very strange
[04/24/2008 11:28:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: she has been with 2 other guys since
[04/24/2008 11:28:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: that is odd
[04/24/2008 11:29:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it was a glitch
[04/24/2008 11:29:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not
[04/24/2008 11:29:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: she probably hates me
[04/24/2008 11:30:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[04/24/2008 11:30:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's most likely something in between those two reasons
[04/24/2008 11:31:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: Woah
[04/24/2008 11:31:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: When steve suggested a late night homework party I thought he meant tonight
[04/24/2008 11:31:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: he meant tomorrow.. he clearly doesn't want me to go to this party thing
[04/24/2008 11:32:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he means tomorrow during BSG?
[04/24/2008 11:32:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm positive he does
[04/24/2008 11:32:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: I packed my homework and everything, 
[04/24/2008 11:33:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel dumb, i should know steve doesnt stay up late on week nights

[04/24/2008 11:48:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe i shoulda gone with her
[04/24/2008 11:49:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[04/24/2008 11:50:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: no nevermind... I need a computer for what I am doing and their monitors have simply too low of a resolution
[04/24/2008 11:51:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: why.. because people are there... and studying is in the air.. i just like it

[04/24/2008 11:57:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got away with it
[04/24/2008 11:57:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: I forgot mine at home... I do my take home tests on printer paper

[04/25/2008 12:04:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i like her because she is intelligent, like most math majors ;-)
[04/25/2008 12:04:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i have a math fetish

[04/25/2008 07:08:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: That's very thoughtful, but I'm not sure what someone you are referring to
[04/25/2008 07:09:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am referring to spending time with you

[04/26/2008 03:12:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: hi
[04/26/2008 03:12:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: hi
[04/26/2008 03:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer is pissed at me
[04/26/2008 03:13:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: You really must have said something to him to make him never make i contact
[04/26/2008 03:13:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was wondering what he would think
[04/26/2008 03:13:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: of us being close at the party
[04/26/2008 03:13:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but at least i don't already have a girlfriend
[04/26/2008 03:13:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i contact.. i mean eye contact
[04/26/2008 03:14:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it is only half as bad if i flirt with you
[04/26/2008 03:14:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: did he talk to you about it.. or can you just tell that he is pissed?
[04/26/2008 03:15:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: he said it was fucked up that i gave him a whole speech and then was flirting with you
[04/26/2008 03:16:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can see that..
[04/26/2008 03:17:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but he's got a girlfriend too
[04/26/2008 03:17:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: so
[04/26/2008 03:17:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: Last night you were saying things about what we should do about us.. but I don't remember what you said really
[04/26/2008 03:17:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have a problem
[04/26/2008 03:17:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would have asked you to stay...
[04/26/2008 03:18:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: but
[04/26/2008 03:18:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been having this dry itchy skin irritation and i was uncomfortable
[04/26/2008 03:18:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and
[04/26/2008 03:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really don't want to hurt steve
[04/26/2008 03:19:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah     steve
[04/26/2008 03:20:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i talked to him earlier. I'm afraid of what Ryan or David would tell him if he asked if anything happened
[04/26/2008 03:20:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be the worst
[04/26/2008 03:22:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know, leaving and turning it into a long distance relationship, if you weren't going to be able to handle that, i guess that would be a good reason to break it off
[04/26/2008 03:22:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you can hope that ryan and dave aren't going to say anything
[04/26/2008 03:22:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and not do anything
[04/26/2008 03:22:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and hope it just fades away
[04/26/2008 03:22:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't know how good of friends Ryan and Steve are
[04/26/2008 03:23:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about dave and steve?
[04/26/2008 03:24:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think they are just acquaintences and I'd imagine David would just say "maybe you should talk to her about it"
[04/26/2008 03:24:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: likely
[04/26/2008 03:26:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: no matter what happens, the time we spent together was amazing
[04/26/2008 03:27:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want to tell steve
[04/26/2008 03:27:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and everything leading up to last night was also entirely genuine, no a result of lust or loneliness 
[04/26/2008 03:28:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is entirely your choice
[04/26/2008 03:28:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: because, I don't regret it
[04/26/2008 03:28:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I regret having cottonmouth though
[04/26/2008 03:29:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[04/26/2008 03:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 03:29:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: sry
[04/26/2008 03:29:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still feel it was a little once sided
[04/26/2008 03:30:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt want to tell you...
[04/26/2008 03:31:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean.. no it was fine
[04/26/2008 03:31:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: what didn't you want to tell me?
[04/26/2008 03:31:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you and the cranberry juice
[04/26/2008 03:31:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get it
[04/26/2008 03:31:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah.. cranberry juice
[04/26/2008 03:32:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: some people think its too much informatoin
[04/26/2008 03:32:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mind
[04/26/2008 03:34:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you say something like we should wait and see what happens?
[04/26/2008 03:35:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: last night
[04/26/2008 03:35:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i meant wait to tell him, i was discouraging it, but if you dont want to then i guess that is good
[04/26/2008 03:35:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. ok that was my question earlier
[04/26/2008 03:36:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: or maybe i meant we should wait to stay together if you left steve
[04/26/2008 03:36:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: is your skin better?
[04/26/2008 03:36:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you are not going to, then that is good too
[04/26/2008 03:36:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i will be fine
[04/26/2008 03:36:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a shower, and to use more lotion
[04/26/2008 03:37:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: All i know is that I kind of want to see you
[04/26/2008 03:37:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i = 8%
[04/26/2008 03:38:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: 8 percent isn't very high
[04/26/2008 03:38:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: its a bond rate
[04/26/2008 03:38:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am confused
[04/26/2008 03:38:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: im trying to get at least some homework done, since i'm putting off my test
[04/26/2008 03:38:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: procrastinate by doing other homework
[04/26/2008 03:38:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's finance
[04/26/2008 03:38:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is a good idea
[04/26/2008 03:41:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you want to see Forgetting Sarah Marshall with John and Abe and Leah and me?
[04/26/2008 03:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: definitely

[04/26/2008 04:06:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I hope Keifer isn't pissed at you for too long. I don't think it's hypocritical, depending on what you said, but I wanted you to be close to me and I didn't want him to be close to me
[04/26/2008 04:07:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 04:07:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is an ass

[04/26/2008 04:22:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: sweet song
[04/26/2008 04:23:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: At first I thought it was gonna be Hooked on a feeling.. which you also have
[04/26/2008 04:23:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 04:25:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: this is so cool, your music thing
[04/26/2008 04:25:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it will get better this summer
[04/26/2008 04:26:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to add a lot of drag and drop
[04/26/2008 04:27:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: nice
[04/26/2008 04:30:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: the music i was asking about last nice was stuff like Real McCoy and Ace of Base
[04/26/2008 04:30:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: last night
[04/26/2008 04:31:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i totally always understand you the first time
[04/26/2008 04:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is kind of cute
[04/26/2008 04:31:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: :)
[04/26/2008 04:32:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: Does it slow your server down if I'm listening to music from it? Or would it take 50 people to do that?
[04/26/2008 04:33:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is based on outgoing bandwidth
[04/26/2008 04:34:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have 3 megabits up and 9 down
[04/26/2008 04:34:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[04/26/2008 04:34:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think 13 people could listen to music off my server before it slowed down
[04/26/2008 04:34:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: assuming no one else is hogging something
[04/26/2008 04:36:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: interesting
[04/26/2008 04:36:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but locally, i have a gigabit connection, so it will never slow it down for me on my desktop
[04/26/2008 04:37:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh well that's nice for you
[04/26/2008 04:38:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it is nice
[04/26/2008 04:38:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i enjoying abstracting my computation power to multiple machines.

[04/26/2008 04:45:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: TIme seemed jumbled last night on the floor
[04/26/2008 04:46:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wonder how long it took me to kiss you
[04/26/2008 04:47:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: about 5 minutes
[04/26/2008 04:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i was pretty messed up too
[04/26/2008 04:47:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i could have been longer
[04/26/2008 04:48:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wanted you to kiss me first so I knew you were okay with it
[04/26/2008 04:48:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess that's what i was waiting for
[04/26/2008 04:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wanted you to want it
[04/26/2008 04:48:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i definitely did
[04/26/2008 04:49:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i couldn't find Real McCoy
[04/26/2008 04:49:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: it makes more sense for you to wait for my first move since im the tied down one
[04/26/2008 04:49:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i searched for it and it came up with 4 songs
[04/26/2008 04:50:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: people tell me you have a boyfriend
[04/26/2008 04:50:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: literally?
[04/26/2008 04:50:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: they were saying that last night to you?
[04/26/2008 04:50:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: this may be a little cruel, but i tell them "you don't have a ring"
[04/26/2008 04:50:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i just mean when you come up
[04/26/2008 04:50:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: in general
[04/26/2008 04:50:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: o
[04/26/2008 04:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel bad for what i might have done to steve
[04/26/2008 04:51:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you guys were madly in love i would never interfere
[04/26/2008 04:51:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wonder if like.. everyone is going to know something is up,... And then yall will be  in the ACM room and someone will let something slip and everything will go nuts!
[04/26/2008 04:52:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know
[04/26/2008 04:52:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i g2g shower

[04/26/2008 06:13:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's pretty horny
[04/26/2008 06:13:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: like always
[04/26/2008 06:13:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: and a little paranoid
[04/26/2008 06:13:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: paranoid?
[04/26/2008 06:13:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: bad because I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend and week

[04/26/2008 06:13:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: *here
[04/26/2008 06:14:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: I had to lie to him
[04/26/2008 06:14:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: and tell him I wouldnt cheat on him and not tell him.
[04/26/2008 06:15:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[04/26/2008 06:15:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: he was like, "why are you all hot"
[04/26/2008 06:15:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: all hot?
[04/26/2008 06:15:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are ho
[04/26/2008 06:16:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: *hot
[04/26/2008 06:16:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is true
[04/26/2008 06:16:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: I said it is because my room is 80 degrees, but i thought it's because I was talking to you
[04/26/2008 06:18:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm thinking at this point we wouldnt be able to be together anyways, because it's reading week and I'm leaving soon
[04/26/2008 06:19:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should follow your heart
[04/26/2008 06:20:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: no matter where you go in life
[04/26/2008 06:20:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe my heart isn't being realistic
[04/26/2008 06:21:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you hope you will find someone in NY?
[04/26/2008 06:21:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[04/26/2008 06:22:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you will stay committed to steve?
[04/26/2008 06:22:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: I hope to be completely focused on my studies.. it's only a year but its a very very hard year and I don't need distractions
[04/26/2008 06:22:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: that has been the plan
[04/26/2008 06:22:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i will always be here for you, as a friend
[04/26/2008 06:23:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: I appreciate that
[04/26/2008 06:23:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you put on lotion?
[04/26/2008 06:23:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha do you like how i pulled down your shirt during battlestar?
[04/26/2008 06:24:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was cute
[04/26/2008 06:24:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: heh
[04/26/2008 06:25:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you like how i pulled up your shirt while we were resisting each other all over my floor?
[04/26/2008 06:25:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: there's a possibility still will come next week.. but there is something I was invited to that same night, so i'm not sure what I shoudl do
[04/26/2008 06:25:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like how you worded that
[04/26/2008 06:25:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve will come
[04/26/2008 06:25:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: geeze
[04/26/2008 06:25:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could hit up both parties
[04/26/2008 06:26:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: thinking about it
[04/26/2008 06:26:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: what i meant was there is a possibility steve will come
[04/26/2008 06:27:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is fine
[04/26/2008 06:27:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am perfectly capable of being diplomatic about the situation
[04/26/2008 06:27:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: steve is her again

[04/26/2008 07:46:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you get my text
[04/26/2008 07:46:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[04/26/2008 07:48:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: He got on his email while he was here and managed to send himself an email with our conversation history without me knowing.
[04/26/2008 07:49:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is a smart guy
[04/26/2008 07:49:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm sorry I let all this happen
[04/26/2008 07:49:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: He didn't break up with me
[04/26/2008 07:49:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was irresponsible on both our parts
[04/26/2008 07:50:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: A part of me wanted him to, and I wanted to break up with him, but I didn't
[04/26/2008 07:52:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/26/2008 07:52:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: stupid sticky keys
[04/26/2008 07:55:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think it means something that the only sure emotion i feel is anger at myself for keeping convo history and not realizing what he was doing on gmail, and anger towards him for doing it
[04/26/2008 07:57:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: I can understand if you don't want to see me or talk to me again
[04/26/2008 07:57:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: ...whether or not i break up with him
[04/26/2008 08:00:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wouldn't break up with him over you or this, I would break up with him because of everything, I mean.. because I feel apathetic about our relationship 
[04/26/2008 08:03:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you are ashamed of what we talked about, that is why you are angry for him seeing it
[04/26/2008 08:04:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, I am
[04/26/2008 08:04:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: I didn't mean to fall for you
[04/26/2008 08:05:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: me neither
[04/26/2008 08:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to make this better
[04/26/2008 08:06:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don' t know what to do
[04/26/2008 08:07:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't know for sure what I want
[04/26/2008 08:07:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want to be loved, and constant little displays of that
[04/26/2008 08:09:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: have you been programming?
[04/26/2008 08:09:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, researching my project
[04/26/2008 08:10:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to steve
[04/26/2008 08:11:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: what did he say?
[04/26/2008 08:11:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: a lot
[04/26/2008 08:12:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think he wants to kill me
[04/26/2008 08:12:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he is absolutely passionate about being with you
[04/26/2008 08:12:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is why i am not worried that you can make it right again
[04/26/2008 08:13:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: I told him what else I did to you, if he didn't mention it
[04/26/2008 08:13:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: and I really wish i hadnt
[04/26/2008 08:13:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: because I don't want him to do anything rash
[04/26/2008 08:14:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: he knows I am not regretful
[04/26/2008 08:14:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not so soon, but it is good you are honest
[04/26/2008 08:14:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: if he wants to fight me, i will not fight back
[04/26/2008 08:15:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is not that you aren't worth fighting for, you are, but i interfered with you relationship, that was wrong of me
[04/26/2008 08:15:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: It was me though!
[04/26/2008 08:16:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't try to stop you
[04/26/2008 08:17:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you done with me?
[04/26/2008 08:17:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don'
[04/26/2008 08:17:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: t know how to answer that
[04/26/2008 08:17:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah I guess it's a fucked up question
[04/26/2008 08:18:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you want to happen
[04/26/2008 08:18:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/26/2008 08:19:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: I want to be a Junior
[04/26/2008 08:19:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: but really
[04/26/2008 08:20:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/26/2008 08:22:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: I want to be sure that Steve and I wouldnt be able to fix our problems that have existed for a while, and so I'd break up with him, and I want you to still like me for two weeks
[04/26/2008 08:24:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: When i was talking to him, the only time I cried was when he said "do you want me to call my mom and have her cancel her hotel resevations for your graduation and say we aren't together anymore?"
[04/26/2008 08:24:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are afraid of disappointing them?
[04/26/2008 08:25:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, i suppose
[04/26/2008 08:25:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like them
[04/26/2008 08:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think maybe that kind of foreshadows your feelings if you were to break up with him?
[04/26/2008 08:26:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't think i'd be too sad if we broke up
[04/26/2008 08:27:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: I just find it strange that I've always been concerned about his family and what they would think
[04/26/2008 08:28:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe because you have a lot of respect for them.  i am sure you don't want to see steve hurt.  have you tried to fix the problems you've been having?
[04/26/2008 08:29:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: I haven't had the urge to try and fix things lately, I just sort of let things be as they are
[04/26/2008 08:31:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think you can fix them by talking to him about it?
[04/26/2008 08:31:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: neh
[04/26/2008 08:34:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think I could have a great life with steve, but that idea isn't based on love or compatibility, just that we have similar goals 
[04/26/2008 08:34:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: I
[04/26/2008 08:34:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think
[04/26/2008 08:35:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think I'm going to, 
[04/26/2008 08:36:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: be strong, and talk to him about it
[04/26/2008 08:43:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you guys talking?
[04/26/2008 08:43:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: Im talking to his roommate sean on the phone
[04/26/2008 08:46:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: but I have to make this decision myself
[04/26/2008 08:46:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should make the decision with steve
[04/26/2008 08:49:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: Talking with Steve has been lacking in any real results or decisions
[04/26/2008 08:50:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm very happy that you aren't pushing me to break up with him
[04/26/2008 08:54:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to be the reason you leave him, just like i said, breaking up with someone for another person is not the right reason, you made it apparent you guys have been having problems for a while, you have to decide if that can change
[04/26/2008 09:00:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: It seems to me that I just ended a 3.5 year relationship.
[04/26/2008 09:00:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: fuck
[04/26/2008 09:02:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you ok?
[04/26/2008 09:02:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess that is a shitty question
[04/26/2008 09:03:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's not a shitty question
[04/26/2008 09:03:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: just... starring at my facebook profile
[04/26/2008 09:05:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: staring
[04/26/2008 09:05:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: thinking i should probably change my relationship status and then delete the mini feed it creates
[04/26/2008 09:06:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: take your time
[04/26/2008 09:08:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: looks like steve took the first step
[04/26/2008 09:08:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am here for you
[04/26/2008 09:08:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if steve was my friend
[04/26/2008 09:09:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd be there for him
[04/26/2008 09:10:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: Brian
[04/26/2008 09:10:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: Crystal
[04/26/2008 09:10:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i said that wrong
[04/26/2008 09:11:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: haha what?
[04/26/2008 09:11:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: if steve was a close friend, i'd be there for is *also
[04/26/2008 09:11:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: I know that is what you meant
[04/26/2008 09:11:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wants me to send him this conversation
[04/26/2008 09:11:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh. yeah. 
[04/26/2008 09:11:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: he did mention that
[04/26/2008 09:12:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: like, send the relationship or ill bash your head in?
[04/26/2008 09:12:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ha, something like that

[04/27/2008 10:56:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: everything ok?
[04/27/2008 10:56:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's a really forgiving person which makes things even harder
[04/27/2008 10:57:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: harder how?
[04/27/2008 10:57:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: A little today i was wondering if i'm throwing away a good thing
[04/27/2008 10:58:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: and maybe im kissing you and doing other things to you to try and cover up my confusion
[04/27/2008 10:58:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: we don't have to do those types of things
[04/27/2008 10:58:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: that might be better
[04/27/2008 10:58:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: can i finish this one problem?
[04/27/2008 10:59:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: will you come back and talk afterwards, i have something i'd like to say but it will take some time to write
[04/27/2008 11:02:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/27/2008 11:18:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad you are getting your work done, let me know when you are finished
[04/27/2008 11:24:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: how much longer are you going to be there?
[04/27/2008 11:24:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: for a while
[04/27/2008 11:25:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: good to know
[04/27/2008 11:25:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think you made a smart decision going over there
[04/27/2008 11:26:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you ready for my message?
[04/27/2008 11:26:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh well im still half way through but go ahead
[04/27/2008 11:26:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i really enjoy being around you, and i love talking to you online, and i think we are pretty solid friends.  i know you must be worried about breaking it off with steve and what might have happened, but the beauty of the situation is that you are free to discover if it is really what you want.  I like to think that if people are meant to be together, then they will find each other again.  the way i feel about us is this: i would like to be in a relationship with you, even if it is very short, and i definitely don't want you to feel like you have to do anything sexually if you don't want to.  so even though you are leaving in two weeks, i don't plan on finding anyone else, just like before i met you this whole semester.  so i guess what i am trying to say is, i am here if you want me, and all i ask is that your honest with me, and i will be the same with you.
[04/27/2008 11:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: sry that is like a book
[04/27/2008 11:27:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol ok
[04/27/2008 11:27:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should read it later
[04/27/2008 11:27:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: already started
[04/27/2008 11:27:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: can i think about a reply?

[04/28/2008 12:17:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: would it be bad in steve knew?
[04/28/2008 12:17:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: and did you think about my query?
[04/28/2008 12:17:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm, I think it might hurt him a littly
[04/28/2008 12:17:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: im thinking about it now
[04/28/2008 12:21:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: here's some stuf
[04/28/2008 12:21:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: not exactly a direct reply
[04/28/2008 12:22:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: Steve really wants me to decide if i want to see if we should fix things. This whole time he talks to me about it, I feel nearly emotionless. I decided to break up with him because the amount I felt like not being with him overpowered the amount I wanted to be with him. He says for me to make this decision properly I should minimize my conversations with you and not see you.................
[04/28/2008 12:22:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: I think you're a freaking great friend, and I didn't like how I was so quiet today around you. I don't want it to be like that. I don't want to stop seeing you either. I am afraid what I feel for you might just be lust and it's clouding my thinking. Maybe I shouldn't overthink it, and just have a nice time with you while i can. But I can't have it both ways..............
[04/28/2008 12:23:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: I have a feeling I'm going to need someone there for me when I transition to grad school and I can see that person being steve. I'm writing a pro's and con's list. I really hope you are being genuine with me about everything. I like the idea of being with you in a relationship but it's not fair to you for me to expect anything long term, since you barely know me................
[04/28/2008 12:23:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: It think Steve is expecting me to say that I want to give it another chance with him, but I'm leaning towards not saying...
[04/28/2008 12:23:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: that.
[04/28/2008 12:24:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's gonna hurt him
[04/28/2008 12:24:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: again
[04/28/2008 12:24:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: fuck
[04/28/2008 12:26:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: did you notice on bsg that even the dog tags they wear dont have corners? Thus having 8 corners really.
[04/28/2008 12:29:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: I called you Brian Cullinana today, my bad
[04/28/2008 12:29:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: everything you say makes sense, but when you get back together with steve again, do you think it is possible you will end up in the same position you are now again?  like i said before, i don't require any commitment from you, and i am a loyal to my close friends.  i have been completely honest with you, and i have not acted on lust.  I usually prefer limiting the sexual contact just so that i can be closer to my significant other.  it seems you have a difficult decision to make, and i hope you stay honest with me; that is all i ask.  do you think that fear of hurting someone is a good reason to be with them?  seems like another one of those things that tie you to a relationship you don't want to be in.
[04/28/2008 12:30:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: *am loyal
[04/28/2008 12:31:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: but we should stop talking about this, i don't want to influence you one way or the other
[04/28/2008 12:31:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i will have a biased opinion
[04/28/2008 12:32:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe you should talk to your roommate, or another friend
[04/28/2008 12:32:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: I think it's possible to get in the same position. Fear of hurting is not a good reason
[04/28/2008 12:32:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: that will be honest with your either way
[04/28/2008 12:32:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: i talked to her
[04/28/2008 12:32:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: what does she think?
[04/28/2008 12:33:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: she said to do the list and to really think about what i want and maybe its good not to talk to you while i think and that if the decision is that i dont want to be with him again, i should grow stronger on my own independently
[04/28/2008 12:34:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 12:34:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe it'll come to me as i do matroid theory, maybe ill talk to my sister, maybe ill sleep on it
[04/28/2008 12:39:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe all of those
[04/28/2008 12:40:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did enjoy being a dirty little secret for 2 days
[04/28/2008 12:40:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[04/28/2008 12:40:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[04/28/2008 12:43:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: you think we could be something?
[04/28/2008 12:47:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: YA you don't have to answer that. 
[04/28/2008 12:48:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think so
[04/28/2008 12:49:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: the attraction is there
[04/28/2008 12:49:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: here i go again expressing my honest, biased opinion
[04/28/2008 12:50:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know you told steve you are done with seeing me
[04/28/2008 12:50:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt tell him that
[04/28/2008 12:51:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: you didn't tell him you weren't going to associate with me anymore/
[04/28/2008 12:51:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/28/2008 12:52:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: i simply agreed that it would probably be better for me not to see you if I really want to make a totally independent decision about whether or not i want to give it a chance, but I never actually told him I would stop talking to you/seeing you, because i dont want to stop
[04/28/2008 12:53:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: I feel like I already know my answer but im afraid to tell him, because he got his hopes up
[04/28/2008 12:54:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: Its POSSIBLE that when we were talking on the phone at 11:15ish I might of said "uh huh" to a questoin like "so are you gonna not talk to him or see him?" but only out of not paying attention to him because I was reading my notes looking for an example
[04/28/2008 12:55:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is ok if you did
[04/28/2008 12:55:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: to my knowledge i honestly didnt
[04/28/2008 12:55:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/28/2008 12:56:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: that makes me feel better
[04/28/2008 12:56:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: but theres that chance i accidently did
[04/28/2008 12:57:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: why, did someone say something?

[04/28/2008 02:44:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was pretty cool
[04/28/2008 02:46:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm not sure when I'll have timet os ee you again
[04/28/2008 02:47:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you are busy you are busy
[04/28/2008 02:48:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[04/28/2008 02:55:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you talked to steve more?
[04/28/2008 02:56:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: well.. he says he doesnt want me to talk to you because it'll sway my decision.. but HE's talking to me and swaying my decision
[04/28/2008 02:59:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: I told him i had neutral feelings, he told me why not give it a try, I told him I like you, he asked me what i want out of that and how long i think it could last, i told him i want someone to really make me feel special and someone I could talk to easily and i dont really have any expectiations on how long it could last, and i later told him i want to see what happens with you, and that i could
[04/28/2008 03:01:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: promise to not be sexual anymore with you, but he thinks it will destroy the chances of me and him, and that I'm confused and he thinks  getting with neither one of you guys is better
[04/28/2008 03:03:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: so do you believe steve when he tells you the commitments he will make to you?
[04/28/2008 03:03:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: i wonder why he didnt do it before
[04/28/2008 03:03:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: you have to ask him that
[04/28/2008 03:04:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: k
[04/28/2008 03:09:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've decided not to make a decision yet
[04/28/2008 03:10:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: told him i need time
[04/28/2008 03:10:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: wait
[04/28/2008 03:10:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: before you decide not to decide
[04/28/2008 03:10:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah?
[04/28/2008 03:10:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to ask you something
[04/28/2008 03:10:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: k shoot
[04/28/2008 03:11:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: if we spent the next two weeks developing this great relationship, and continued to talk all the time online during the summer and while you are in NY
[04/28/2008 03:11:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: ...
[04/28/2008 03:11:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: but then afterwards to came back and we could not be together
[04/28/2008 03:11:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: would you regret breaking up with steve
[04/28/2008 03:11:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: what if steve wouldn't take you back?
[04/28/2008 03:12:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: would you want to be secure in that relationship?  or have the unexpected in another?
[04/28/2008 03:12:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[04/28/2008 03:13:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry im thinking
[04/28/2008 03:13:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's ok take your time
[04/28/2008 03:16:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: I think that when you said if two people are meant to be together, they'll find each other again, you were right.
[04/28/2008 03:16:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: unexpected.
[04/28/2008 03:16:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: even if steve found someone else to spend his life with?  would you regret it then?
[04/28/2008 03:18:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont think so. I'd want him to be happy, and i am positive there'd be someone else for me.
[04/28/2008 03:27:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i made it sound like we could have something great, but if there is no sexual contact and the next two weeks are mediocre for you, do you think you would see steve again?
[04/28/2008 03:28:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes.
[04/28/2008 03:34:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: I guess he told you my secret
[04/28/2008 03:34:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to keep secrets
[04/28/2008 03:35:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe ill be with him this week and if he just bothers me, I'll end it.
[04/28/2008 03:35:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: you do mean a lot to him, and i think he would enjoy that
[04/28/2008 03:35:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: but just promise me you won't get trapped in something you can't get out of again
[04/28/2008 03:36:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's overwhelming how much he says I mean to him.. cuz I feel so drastically different about him
[04/28/2008 03:36:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: i can't force feelings
[04/28/2008 03:36:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are an amazing person, and you should be bold and independent
[04/28/2008 03:36:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: I can promise that
[04/28/2008 03:37:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: i hope so, but focus on your studies too
[04/28/2008 03:38:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: k dad
[04/28/2008 03:38:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/28/2008 03:38:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am just good at giving advice
[04/28/2008 03:38:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: you're so super fraking cool
[04/28/2008 03:39:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: i like to think so, i wish more people felt the same
[04/28/2008 03:39:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: frak em
[04/28/2008 03:42:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: i told him ill give him a chance this week, but i dont think i'll be into it, guess i should try to have an open mind or whatever
[04/28/2008 03:42:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely, focus on him
[04/28/2008 03:43:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: and like i said before, i am will always be here as a friend, and i don't really plan on hooking up with other girls, i guess i am just picky
[04/28/2008 03:43:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: But i like your last name so much
[04/28/2008 03:45:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's ridiculous how much I'm sorry you are going through this
[04/28/2008 03:55:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are worth it
[04/28/2008 03:56:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm sorry!!1
[04/28/2008 03:56:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: you are so practical about this
[04/28/2008 03:56:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: wish i could be more like you
[04/28/2008 03:56:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have had lots of experience dealing with difficult and obsessive people
[04/28/2008 03:56:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: I havent gotten any of my test done for a couple hours cuz of this Raytheon crap
[04/28/2008 03:57:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: you sayin my boyfriend's obsessive?
[04/28/2008 03:57:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't say that....
[04/28/2008 03:57:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i am very logic, that is why i am attracted to intelligent women
[04/28/2008 03:58:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: despite what steve said, i wasn't into drugs when i first got to NAU, and I dont have manic and depressive episodes anymore
[04/28/2008 03:58:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is ok if you do
[04/28/2008 03:58:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like he was afraid that if you were with some other guy, they would be unable to discover and deal with those things
[04/28/2008 03:59:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: well maybe a little depression first semester, but i was a girl trying to transition into something so new and scary
[04/28/2008 03:59:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybes
[04/28/2008 03:59:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is a manic depressant, they have drugs for that now
[04/28/2008 03:59:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow
[04/28/2008 04:00:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think learning about your partner is essential, you shouldn't be afraid of what you might find out as long as they are still the good kind of person you enjoy
[04/28/2008 04:00:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: ive got me some pillz too
[04/28/2008 04:00:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: I think it's pretty amazing how far I've come since high school
[04/28/2008 04:01:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: I will brb
[04/28/2008 04:08:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: Your project is done, why are you still up?
[04/28/2008 04:08:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: to keep you company
[04/28/2008 04:09:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you have someone to say goodnight to
[04/28/2008 04:09:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: aw sweet
[04/28/2008 04:10:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: Was the first girl you did oral things with a virgin to oral things?
[04/28/2008 04:10:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes she was a vigin to everything except "hand stuff"
[04/28/2008 04:11:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: Was the girl who took your v card and virgin to everything?
[04/28/2008 04:11:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: you know what im getting at..
[04/28/2008 04:11:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: she had been with other guys before me, but she is clean
[04/28/2008 04:11:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i trust her
[04/28/2008 04:12:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: I was tested in the middle of being with steve and I'm clean
[04/28/2008 04:12:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is good!
[04/28/2008 04:12:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: awesome!
[04/28/2008 04:12:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to ask you, but i trust you
[04/28/2008 04:13:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: do you think you could bring my food to work tomorrow?
[04/28/2008 04:13:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: And then i could pick it up after 11:10
[04/28/2008 04:13:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you not allowed to come over any more?
[04/28/2008 04:13:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: so i could eat it instead of walking home for food and back to the math building and wasting 30 precious minutes of time i could be finishing my test?
[04/28/2008 04:14:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: to your place? uh no such "rule" was established, but I think he'd like it better that way
[04/28/2008 04:16:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am running out of whiskey
[04/28/2008 04:17:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: where do you work?
[04/28/2008 04:17:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: I mean bring it to your work..
[04/28/2008 04:17:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: I am currently unemployed
[04/28/2008 04:18:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can do that, i will have to locate a fridge
[04/28/2008 04:18:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: that
[04/28/2008 04:19:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: would be nice
[04/28/2008 04:19:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: ahhh itchy
[04/28/2008 04:19:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[04/28/2008 04:19:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: i would hope that lotion would help
[04/28/2008 04:20:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: were you uncomfortable around me cuz of it?
[04/28/2008 04:20:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i know this may deter you away from me, but i am not sure what the itchy is all about, the dry skin is usually seasonal, but this itchy is different
[04/28/2008 04:20:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: im not deterred
[04/28/2008 04:20:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: the itchyis kinda weird
[04/28/2008 04:20:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: i mean.. it's strange that its out of the ordinary
[04/28/2008 04:21:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: well just in-case it is something bizarre and your skin got itchy from being around me, then you should let me know
[04/28/2008 04:21:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: is that deterring yet?
[04/28/2008 04:21:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'll keep note
[04/28/2008 04:21:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[04/28/2008 04:21:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i dont ever get itchy, so i'll know somethings up if i get itchy
[04/28/2008 04:22:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: i doubt that could happen because i am a very clean person, and totally hygienic, so maybe it is just allergies
[04/28/2008 04:22:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: do you want me to remind you about the food?
[04/28/2008 04:22:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: allergies to ME
[04/28/2008 04:22:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll set an alarm
[04/28/2008 04:22:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: a phone reminder?
[04/28/2008 04:23:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to set a seperate alarm on my phone
[04/28/2008 04:23:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'll go ahead and remind myself to go to BIO Rm ...
[04/28/2008 04:23:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i must be allergic to beautiful women, that is why i can never keep one around
[04/28/2008 04:23:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[04/28/2008 04:24:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: (what room?)
[04/28/2008 04:24:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: 165
[04/28/2008 04:25:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: done.. expect me at 11:35
[04/28/2008 04:26:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/28/2008 04:26:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i do find it kind of strange that after all you and steve have been through he still wants to be with you
[04/28/2008 04:27:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: it just seems very unhealthy, especially since he was with another woman so recently
[04/28/2008 04:27:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is just an outsider looking in
[04/28/2008 04:28:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: I wonder if he is the one making the wrong decision
[04/28/2008 04:28:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he need to experience another woman
[04/28/2008 04:28:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: has he had girlfriends before?
[04/28/2008 04:28:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: Kinda bummed I don't get to spend time with you similar to this weekend
[04/28/2008 04:29:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah one serious one
[04/28/2008 04:29:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: this weekend was nothing short of extraordinary
[04/28/2008 04:29:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is just how i feel
[04/28/2008 04:30:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: for some people it was terrible
[04/28/2008 04:30:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i'll polish off the rest of this wiskey and take a bath
[04/28/2008 04:31:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: you say that.. but i dont exactly completely feel it when im withyou
[04/28/2008 04:31:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: you don't feel extraordinary?
[04/28/2008 04:31:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: like you're a bit different online
[04/28/2008 04:31:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry, i guess i am a little shy too
[04/28/2008 04:31:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont feel that you think it's extraordinary
[04/28/2008 04:31:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: or i am
[04/28/2008 04:31:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you hang out with me when i am around other friends to will see the real me
[04/28/2008 04:32:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: like last friday
[04/28/2008 04:32:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i assure you, the only thing that is affecting the way i act around you is being so full of feelings that i can hardly handle it
[04/28/2008 04:33:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am usually just as outspoken in person as i am online
[04/28/2008 04:33:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is why i hope we can find time to hang out casually, and you can again see the real me, as we get used to each other
[04/28/2008 04:34:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'd love to get used to you
[04/28/2008 04:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i'll see you next friday then?
[04/28/2008 04:35:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: if there was a girl you really liked, and she liked you, and she didnt have exish boyfriend issues, and you spend two awesome weeks with her and talked over the summer, and she went to graduate school for a year and then came back, but you still had a year of school left, but for some reason wanted to stay with her, what would you expect her to do?
[04/28/2008 04:36:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i mean.. like she's done with school.. and your not
[04/28/2008 04:36:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: and flagstaff might not be the best place for her to start a career
[04/28/2008 04:37:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would expect her follow her heart, sure i'd love to be with her, i guess if we could make it through that time apart and still want to be together, then she could start her career in another city and i'd be ok with that, even if we only see each other of weekends or something
[04/28/2008 04:38:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is planning too far ahead
[04/28/2008 04:38:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol yeah
[04/28/2008 04:38:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: we would have to see how it feels at the time
[04/28/2008 04:39:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: just making conversation :$
[04/28/2008 04:39:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: that certainly is a sensible thing to do
[04/28/2008 04:39:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 04:40:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: so it's late
[04/28/2008 04:41:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: I doubt a little that you're up just to say night to me, but you don't have to stay up for me.
[04/28/2008 04:43:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: believe what you will
[04/28/2008 04:43:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: im doubtful about me and steve's second chance.
[04/28/2008 04:43:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha okay
[04/28/2008 04:44:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: my stuff is all put away now
[04/28/2008 04:45:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to encourage you to really focus on steve this week
[04/28/2008 04:45:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: now it's me staying up to say goodnight to you
[04/28/2008 04:45:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay.. you're right
[04/28/2008 04:45:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i hope you still come to my party
[04/28/2008 04:45:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: so make your decision by then
[04/28/2008 04:45:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha.. okay we'll see
[04/28/2008 04:45:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: j/k
[04/28/2008 04:45:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: its a busy WEEKOWIRJG
[04/28/2008 04:45:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to
[04/28/2008 04:46:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: uh huh
[04/28/2008 04:46:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i hope you come no matter what you decide
[04/28/2008 04:46:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: just let me know
[04/28/2008 04:46:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: I plan to
[04/28/2008 04:46:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: .. to let you know
[04/28/2008 04:47:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: this weekend was unforgettable, but steve is a special guy, and he seems like he wants to be will you a lot
[04/28/2008 04:47:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: and don't worry about hurting my feelings if you decide to stay with him
[04/28/2008 04:48:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: just make sure that you stay amazing and don't let anyone bring you down or hold you back from your full potential
[04/28/2008 04:48:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's a thoughtful thing to say
[04/28/2008 04:49:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have put a lot of thought into the last couple of days, i hope you did too
[04/28/2008 04:49:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: me too Brian
[04/28/2008 04:51:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's time for bed for me
[04/28/2008 04:52:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: alrighty
[04/28/2008 04:52:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: goodnight

[04/28/2008 03:18:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: you should take one if your tired
[04/28/2008 03:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can never fall asleep that quick so i always end up sleeping longer
[04/28/2008 03:18:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i always wake up less tired if its less than a half hour
[04/28/2008 03:18:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: at least you are resting
[04/28/2008 03:18:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah my laundry!

[04/28/2008 03:18:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol ahahaha
[04/28/2008 03:19:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: not even gonna tell you what just happened
[04/28/2008 03:20:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's such a Meghan thing to do (burnt pasta girl)
[04/28/2008 03:20:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: now you have to tell me!
[04/28/2008 03:20:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: WELL, 
[04/28/2008 03:20:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can't say "i'm not going to tell you" and then not tell!
[04/28/2008 03:20:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's funny how it works that way
[04/28/2008 03:21:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: I forgot to close the lid on the washer so my clothes have just been sitting there for 25 minutes
[04/28/2008 03:21:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess i was just tired
[04/28/2008 03:21:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/28/2008 03:21:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: :$
[04/28/2008 03:22:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i was a better person
[04/28/2008 03:23:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you talking about laughing at/with me, or something else?
[04/28/2008 03:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: something else
[04/28/2008 03:23:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you want to tell me?
[04/28/2008 03:23:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just mean in general
[04/28/2008 03:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i can be a better person, and i want to be, but i make bad decisions
[04/28/2008 03:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: like speak and act without thinking
[04/28/2008 03:24:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: that kind of stuff
[04/28/2008 03:25:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I somewhat admire someone who can speak and act without thinking, instead of living in their head like i do
[04/28/2008 03:25:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho, it is just something that i have been thinking about, i didn't mean to pour any of it on you
[04/28/2008 03:27:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think you're a good guy, you should give yourself more credit, we all make bad decision sometimes, I guess it matters how we handle them afterwards
[04/28/2008 03:28:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, that is good insight
[04/28/2008 03:31:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you thinking that how the way we are makes you a bad person?
[04/28/2008 03:33:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just think i would have handled things better if i had a little more sense
[04/28/2008 03:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a good and bad way to steal a guys girlfriend
[04/28/2008 03:33:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: even if it was only for a few days
[04/28/2008 03:34:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: did anyone say anything today to you?
[04/28/2008 03:34:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: naw, just thinking
[04/28/2008 03:36:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you going to be working on homework now? I am now, so I may not talk much
[04/28/2008 03:36:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will find something to do, study hard!1
[04/28/2008 03:37:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay!
[04/28/2008 03:37:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: "everybody's workin' for the weekend"
 "everybody wants a little romance"

[04/28/2008 03:37:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didn't know
[04/28/2008 03:38:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: Being hungry is such an inconvenience at this time of the semester!
[04/28/2008 03:39:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 03:40:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: and you didnt even make me roasted garlic
[04/28/2008 03:41:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: I can't take the hunger anymroe
[04/28/2008 03:45:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh I know why i didn't close the washer lid, I wanted to add some socks to the load
[04/28/2008 03:45:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i guess forgetting to do that is just as bad
[04/28/2008 03:46:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you ahave work tomorrow too?
[04/28/2008 03:47:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do
[04/28/2008 03:48:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: I;m glad you didn't just keep quiet about my arm
[04/28/2008 03:50:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i care about you
[04/28/2008 03:51:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really do
[04/28/2008 03:51:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's comforting
[04/28/2008 03:52:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: a tiny part of me is thinking, what if Brian is really just an asshole?
[04/28/2008 03:52:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: to be honest
[04/28/2008 03:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't blame you
[04/28/2008 03:54:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i try pretty hard not to be an asshole
[04/28/2008 03:55:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do your instincts tell you?
[04/28/2008 03:55:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: even with me?
[04/28/2008 03:55:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you mean even with me?
[04/28/2008 03:55:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: that i try not to be an asshole?
[04/28/2008 03:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that what you really think?
[04/28/2008 03:56:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: did it upset you that i saw your scar and asked you about it?
[04/28/2008 03:57:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it wrong that i want to know more about your life?
[04/28/2008 03:57:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry i was switching laundry
[04/28/2008 03:58:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: what i mean by even with me is im wondering if you have to try hard to not be an asshole when you are around me
[04/28/2008 03:58:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i meant is that i try to do a lot of self improvement
[04/28/2008 03:59:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if i am ever out of line i hope you will tell me
[04/28/2008 03:59:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm not upset about the scar question, I do desire for you to know more about my life (and it's not wrong for you to want it too), I just wasn't sure how to tell you yet
[04/28/2008 03:59:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh okay
[04/28/2008 03:59:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope you don't think i am an asshole
[04/28/2008 04:00:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill tell you, but you have been good to me so far
[04/28/2008 04:00:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but incase you are wondering, i am 100% myself around you
[04/28/2008 04:01:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont think i am
[04/28/2008 04:01:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[04/28/2008 04:01:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: when do you work?

[04/28/2008 04:01:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: 9 am to 1:15 pm
[04/28/2008 04:02:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: I have walls, I'm a wall kinda girl at first,  but I always had a hard time taking down my walls when i was with steve, that was part of the communication problem
[04/28/2008 04:03:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i c
[04/28/2008 04:04:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought you said you have work tomorrow too
[04/28/2008 04:04:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i am not going to do it right now
[04/28/2008 04:05:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's not what i meant
[04/28/2008 04:05:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im going to make a sandwhich
[04/28/2008 04:06:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i want you to know you can be yourself around me, i won't think less of you

[04/28/2008 05:54:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: hey brian
[04/28/2008 05:54:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: hi
[04/28/2008 05:55:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: Have you talked to David at all?
[04/28/2008 05:55:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to David Smith last night
[04/28/2008 05:55:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have not talked to my roommate today
[04/28/2008 05:56:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve told me your roommate mentioned maybe planning on talking to you today
[04/28/2008 05:58:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: I talked to Steve
[04/28/2008 05:59:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah my roommate hasn't said anything
[04/28/2008 06:00:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm really concerned about your well being, you know, like your relationship with your friends and roommate, and I think it would be better for you if I stopped seeing you for a bit
[04/28/2008 06:00:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: These started out as Steve's words, but i think it makes a lot of sense
[04/28/2008 06:01:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I care about your feelings, and I wonder if it would hurt you if we become more of friends rather than people interested in eachother
[04/28/2008 06:01:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't completely disagree, but i enjoy seeing you, so the rest of the world can fuckin deal with it
[04/28/2008 06:02:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you just want to be friends i suppose that is fine
[04/28/2008 06:02:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i would be a little disappointed but only naturally
[04/28/2008 06:03:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm just as disappointed too, but I think me and Steve are worth a try, I think he is being for real when he says he can change
[04/28/2008 06:06:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: I hope you'll stay a good friend, and keep talking with me even after school ends for me, I think things will go back to normal this way rather than us starting a relationship, and I think those are the only two options
[04/28/2008 06:07:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: just as long as you are happy
[04/28/2008 06:08:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: I feel like I'm fucking you over, i feel terrible about it and all this
[04/28/2008 06:10:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: To be honest, I've wondered what it would be like to be with you long term, I don't know if you thought the same thing
[04/28/2008 06:10:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess it doesn't help that i say these things
[04/28/2008 06:11:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: to be perfectly honest, i think you are making the wrong decision, i have tried to remain neutral as best i could, and i am glad you decided to give it another shot with steve, but i don't think you guys are right, and i think you need to be more independent.  you don't need a man to make you feel good and secure.  a man should compliment your personality not control it.
[04/28/2008 06:12:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i think we should stop talking about relationship stuff
[04/28/2008 06:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: how was the rest of your day?
[04/28/2008 06:13:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: Basically, i turned in a shitty incomplete test, but I'm fine with it and told my teacher I had a rough weekend
[04/28/2008 06:14:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah?  can't you get an extension for that kind of stuff?
[04/28/2008 06:15:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: Yeah, and he would very likely give me one, but I don't want one. I don't think I would do much better with one, especially since I have other things to do.
[04/28/2008 06:15:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm basically sick of looking at it
[04/28/2008 06:15:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i know how that is
[04/28/2008 06:15:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is probably why i didn't do so hot on the last principles test
[04/28/2008 06:16:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: like, you didn't care anymore about it?
[04/28/2008 06:17:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 06:17:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am worn out
[04/28/2008 06:19:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I just need to say that I'm really super duper way sorry, I can't stand the thought of you moping about my decision
[04/28/2008 06:20:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is your decision, i'll be here as a friend just like we planned from the start
[04/28/2008 06:21:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what it is all about, making mutual decisions, feeling the same way about each other
[04/28/2008 06:22:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay. So what are you up to the rest of the evening?
[04/28/2008 06:22:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: chillin like a villian
[04/28/2008 06:23:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: might go watch freaks n geeks later
[04/28/2008 06:25:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are you up to tonight?
[04/28/2008 06:26:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: never seen freaks and geeks

[04/28/2008 07:33:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: you can still talk to me freely, unless that makes it suck more
[04/28/2008 07:33:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: you wouldnt talk about it if it wasnt important, i don't think

[04/28/2008 09:45:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve mentioned when talking at me, that you were easily influenced
[04/28/2008 09:45:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i didn't want to believe that

[04/28/2008 10:43:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: I didn't expect to feel this way
[04/28/2008 10:45:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: I mean, I knew i'd be sad, but I guess i didnt realize how much our time together and the thought of spending more time together in the future meant to me
[04/28/2008 10:45:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I should stop talking about it.
[04/28/2008 10:46:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay, im okay now
[04/28/2008 10:46:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I can get back to work now
[04/28/2008 10:46:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad
[04/28/2008 10:47:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but just so you know
[04/28/2008 10:47:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just needed a 2 minute cry i guess
[04/28/2008 10:47:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: yea?
[04/28/2008 10:47:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope we spend time together in the future, i am sure we will
[04/28/2008 10:48:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm glad you say that
[04/28/2008 10:49:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i guess it just won't be as quite intimate (in the familiarity sense, not the sexual sense), and i think we both have to accept that
[04/28/2008 10:49:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: uh huh
[04/28/2008 10:52:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: im reinstalling Foobar
[04/28/2008 10:53:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me know how it goes
[04/28/2008 10:59:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is odd that you spent any time crying over me, but you did not over steve
[04/28/2008 11:00:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: dude i know!
[04/28/2008 11:01:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not trying to imply anything, but i think during this whole week you really need to think about how you feel, and the things that make you feel good or bad
[04/28/2008 11:05:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: It's not just about me, I think it's better for you with your friendships for us to keep our distance, but you made it seem like you dont care what they would think
[04/28/2008 11:06:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh these trains in my model
[04/28/2008 11:07:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do not care if other people see us together, secrecy is not a good way to build a relationship
[04/28/2008 11:08:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like how you have a monitor dedicated to trillian and your conversations

[04/28/2008 11:19:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to still get to know you
[04/28/2008 11:19:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: i agree with you about today
[04/28/2008 11:22:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to get to know you too

[04/28/2008 11:23:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i consider you with him based on what you said

[04/29/2008 12:51:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[04/29/2008 12:53:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: I mean, there's a chance that I just cant get to that right place in the relationship, and keep not feeling anything wonderful
[04/29/2008 12:53:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: you should always feel wonderful
[04/29/2008 12:55:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you like rain?
[04/29/2008 12:56:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: I have nothing against rain
[04/29/2008 12:57:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: I actually like rainy days, now that I think about it
[04/29/2008 12:57:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: but at a place like here or tucson where its not happening year round, so it is still special
[04/29/2008 12:58:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: shoot my analogy won't work then
[04/29/2008 12:58:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: and tucson has those trees that make it smell even better
[04/29/2008 12:58:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry to ruin it!
[04/29/2008 12:58:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i will tell you anyways
[04/29/2008 12:59:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i like rain
[04/29/2008 01:00:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: so relationships are like a guy getting flowers (or for me girl that i love) standing on my doorstep in the rain...  rain i nice, and having some is relieving, but loving someone is the best feeling in the world
[04/29/2008 01:00:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: *rain is nice
[04/29/2008 01:01:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: *and having someone is relieving
[04/29/2008 01:01:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i suck at typing
[04/29/2008 01:01:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: no i geti t
[04/29/2008 01:02:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: worded a little strangely
[04/29/2008 01:03:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is just what i think about, when i think about being in that great relationship
[04/29/2008 01:03:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was hard to explain in a way you could relate to
[04/29/2008 01:03:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: you could try me
[04/29/2008 01:03:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if you image a guy standing in the rain, waiting for you to invite him in, how would you feel
[04/29/2008 01:04:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you don't really enjoy rain so i am not sure it will work
[04/29/2008 01:04:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: you want to invite them in, but you feel that passion to join them in the rain, and just be sopping wet
[04/29/2008 01:04:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt say i dont enjoy rain
[04/29/2008 01:05:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: the last thing you said makes you make more sense
[04/29/2008 01:05:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: but either way, he is there waiting on your door step, and that is love
[04/29/2008 01:05:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: or for me (she)
[04/29/2008 01:06:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's a pretty profound way to look at love
[04/29/2008 01:07:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: you suprise me sometimes
[04/29/2008 01:09:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: you look indecisive right now about what to say
[04/29/2008 01:09:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i said it wrong, or maybe it is profound, but i think love is that feeling when you look at someone and you *sigh*, but it is a happy sigh, and you know you are glad to be with them
[04/29/2008 01:10:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess what i am trying to say is...
[04/29/2008 01:10:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont like the "Brian Cullinan is writing a message" thing, I dont know if you have a similar thing, but I feel like, even though it builds anticipation, it ruins the........ spontaneity
[04/29/2008 01:10:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: or mysetery
[04/29/2008 01:11:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is not the same kind of sigh when you wake up in  the morning with an arm around you, and it is not the sigh when you leave for work in the morning, or get home at night and crash on the couch infront of the TV
[04/29/2008 01:11:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: i get the kind of sigh
[04/29/2008 01:12:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's like the sigh when you can
[04/29/2008 01:12:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: uh.. hold on
[04/29/2008 01:12:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is the sigh when you look at someone and they do something unexpected, and you realize that they are the most amazing person you have ever been with
[04/29/2008 01:12:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know
[04/29/2008 01:12:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is kind of hard to describe
[04/29/2008 01:13:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i hope you feel it all the time with steve
[04/29/2008 01:13:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: Steve once asked me if i could love you
[04/29/2008 01:14:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: I............................................................................ changed the subject
[04/29/2008 01:14:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry, i digress a bit, feeling wonderful all the time, i just like when you sigh from happiness
[04/29/2008 01:15:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: you feel wonderful because you are in love, and that should be all the time
[04/29/2008 01:15:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: did you feel that a lot with your last g/f?
[04/29/2008 01:15:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: especially for a relationship of 3.5 years
[04/29/2008 01:15:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: up until when we were falling apart i felt that every day
[04/29/2008 01:16:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: and when our relationships started to go downhill, it was at least once a day
[04/29/2008 01:16:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm ashamed that you are telling me how I should feel in my relationship with Steve.
[04/29/2008 01:16:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am just telling you how i would feel if i was in a relationship that long
[04/29/2008 01:16:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is all
[04/29/2008 01:17:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: you can feel whatever you want
[04/29/2008 01:17:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i like that feeling, and i think it feels right
[04/29/2008 01:17:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: I lost that feeling a long time ago, and my big fear is not getting it back and hurting him again, or settling
[04/29/2008 01:18:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: I envy you for being so aware of your feelings
[04/29/2008 01:21:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am very decisive
[04/29/2008 01:21:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i feel.
[04/29/2008 01:21:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i am never afraid to express it
[04/29/2008 01:21:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: I notice I smile a lot with you, maybe cuz you're smiling too, or im nervous, or happy
[04/29/2008 01:22:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: haha, any one of those i guess
[04/29/2008 01:22:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i smile too
[04/29/2008 01:23:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: but on the other hand, maybe it just feels new when we are together, because there is so much (too much) to discover, so it is easy to be interested
[04/29/2008 01:24:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: totally
[04/29/2008 01:25:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know i came to a strange realization, that may explain why i like the image of someone waiting in the rain for me
[04/29/2008 01:25:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: im interested in hearing it
[04/29/2008 01:26:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not one of those people that always like to provide for my significant other...
[04/29/2008 01:26:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: so what i mean by that is
[04/29/2008 01:26:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: what do you mean by that?
[04/29/2008 01:26:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have the "i can take care of her, and i am the only one that can take care of her" attitude
[04/29/2008 01:27:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: understand?
[04/29/2008 01:27:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[04/29/2008 01:28:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: steve kind of has that attitude
[04/29/2008 01:28:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: my attitude is more "please let me be there for you" and "i want to be with you but only if you feel the same"
[04/29/2008 01:28:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: i used to like it, but I grew more independent 
[04/29/2008 01:28:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i guess my example of a woman waiting in the rain for me to embrace her is an exmaple of "i want to be with you"
[04/29/2008 01:29:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: make sense?
[04/29/2008 01:29:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: give me a minute to think about it
[04/29/2008 01:29:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know i am confusing sometimes
[04/29/2008 01:29:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: why are you so open tonight?
[04/29/2008 01:29:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: no I like it
[04/29/2008 01:29:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i owe you for not talking all day
[04/29/2008 01:30:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[04/29/2008 01:30:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's totally understandable Brian, not talking to me...
[04/29/2008 01:30:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: gah you're cute
[04/29/2008 01:31:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: but this [04/28/2008 10:41:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: wow, I'm crying over losing you
[04/29/2008 01:31:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: really set me off
[04/29/2008 01:32:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: seeing that again made my heart feel tight for half a second
[04/29/2008 01:37:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i am going to go get fast food, then feel like a bad person for liking it
[04/29/2008 01:37:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: the rain makes sense
[04/29/2008 01:37:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol, no
[04/29/2008 01:37:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: i mean.. dont feel bad
[04/29/2008 01:37:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: ill ttyl, hopefully ill still be on
[04/29/2008 01:38:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/29/2008 01:38:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: kk bie
[04/29/2008 01:38:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: brb
[04/29/2008 01:51:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've been eating the same sandwich for 9 hours
[04/29/2008 01:59:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: no fast food for me :-(
[04/29/2008 02:00:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: they weren't taking cards and i don't have cash
[04/29/2008 02:00:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i left, but i remembered i washed my soup bowl, so i feel happy
[04/29/2008 02:00:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: well.. now you don't have to feel bad for liking it
[04/29/2008 02:00:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: you washed your soup bowl...
[04/29/2008 02:01:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: what place is open now?
[04/29/2008 02:04:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: Is there any way you can tell what time BSG is going to start
[04/29/2008 02:04:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: because there are two other things I might like to do that night
[04/29/2008 02:04:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: not really
[04/29/2008 02:05:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's terrible.
[04/29/2008 02:06:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: two other things?
[04/29/2008 02:06:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess you don't have to come
[04/29/2008 02:06:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: brb
[04/29/2008 02:08:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: At 9:45 my roommates and two other people are planning on hitting the bars til they close, at 12 am my friend Katie Schmazel is having a birthday night during which they'll go to the bars around midnight.. so I might be able to hang out before BSG and leave when it comes on (and not drink)
[04/29/2008 02:09:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is up to you
[04/29/2008 02:09:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: what's your satellite provider?
[04/29/2008 02:10:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know
[04/29/2008 02:18:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: hey

[04/29/2008 02:24:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: you look like that girl waiting on the doorstep
[04/29/2008 02:26:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: I figured it would be that one.
[04/29/2008 02:28:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would join you in the rain
[04/29/2008 02:28:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: That would be a wonderful feeling
[04/29/2008 02:29:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think so
[04/29/2008 02:31:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: she's talking back :)

[04/29/2008 02:33:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: school blues and my wack love life
[04/29/2008 02:33:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: at least you have a love life
[04/29/2008 02:34:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: My wack love life includes you
[04/29/2008 02:34:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: but you arent wack.
[04/29/2008 02:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love grey's anatomy
[04/29/2008 02:35:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: my love life is like a match, when you first strike it it explodes with fire, but it eventually burns you and dies
[04/29/2008 02:35:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol, :-D
[04/29/2008 02:36:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: what an insightful show.
[04/29/2008 02:36:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: I like that show too.
[04/29/2008 02:37:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: no that was 100% me
[04/29/2008 02:38:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: I mean the show is very wordy
[04/29/2008 02:38:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/29/2008 02:38:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's amazing how often people on that show can ramble
[04/29/2008 02:38:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont like your analogy
[04/29/2008 02:38:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: haha
[04/29/2008 02:38:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry
[04/29/2008 02:38:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: hahaha
[04/29/2008 02:38:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't mean you
[04/29/2008 02:39:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: It reminded me of me and steve
[04/29/2008 02:39:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: it just seems to always happen that way
[04/29/2008 02:40:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'm sorry
[04/29/2008 02:40:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's ok
[04/29/2008 02:41:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i cut myself on a dr. pepper
[04/29/2008 02:42:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: lip?
[04/29/2008 02:42:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: finger?
[04/29/2008 02:42:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: finger
[04/29/2008 02:43:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: "Finger bang bang bang, I'm gonna finger bang you into my life, girl you like the finger bang and it's alright"
[04/29/2008 02:44:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/29/2008 02:46:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: I REALLY like the song in the last part of the last episode of BSG season three
[04/29/2008 02:46:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: all along the watchtower
[04/29/2008 02:46:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: jimi hendrix
[04/29/2008 02:46:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: "there must be some kind of way out of here"
[04/29/2008 02:47:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: said the joker to the theif
[04/29/2008 02:47:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: good song
[04/29/2008 02:48:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: I used to repeat it on the way to class.
[04/29/2008 02:48:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: how come?
[04/29/2008 02:49:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz i like the song?

[04/29/2008 02:50:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: come again?
[04/29/2008 02:50:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: interesting.
[04/29/2008 02:51:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol, i was just testing the sound.
[04/29/2008 02:51:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: ph
[04/29/2008 02:51:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: *oh
[04/29/2008 02:51:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: do i keep you from doing your work too much?
[04/29/2008 02:51:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: i added a period
[04/29/2008 02:51:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: no
[04/29/2008 02:51:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: the period was a perfect touch
[04/29/2008 02:51:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[04/29/2008 02:53:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: you need to go to bed
[04/29/2008 02:53:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh?
[04/29/2008 02:53:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: you think so?
[04/29/2008 02:53:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: really?
[04/29/2008 02:54:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: And what about you, professor?
[04/29/2008 02:54:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: huh?
[04/29/2008 02:54:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am good
[04/29/2008 02:56:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: watching grey's anatomy
[04/29/2008 02:58:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: Why you gotta be so charming?
[04/29/2008 02:58:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i love....
[04/29/2008 02:59:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: *tear* this is a really sad episode
[04/29/2008 02:59:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: And why do I have to be so smitten with you?
[04/29/2008 02:59:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: which one?
[04/29/2008 02:59:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: is it new?
[04/29/2008 03:00:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: the new one
[04/29/2008 03:00:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. ok.. dont tell me
[04/29/2008 03:02:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: the thing is.  you are not smitten with me, you are smitten with the idea of me.  you may think that i am great, but that is just because you haven't seen all may flaws.  all those things that make me imperfect.
[04/29/2008 03:05:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've wanted you to say something like this, I think you are right that I like the idea of you
[04/29/2008 03:07:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: But I like the idea so much that i'd wait in the rain to see if it could be you and everything about you that I grow to like
[04/29/2008 03:07:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: then...
[04/29/2008 03:08:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll wait in the doorway
[04/29/2008 03:08:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm not sure I can keep talking to you right now
[04/29/2008 03:09:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure i trust myself around you
[04/29/2008 03:09:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: ... but it
[04/29/2008 03:09:20 AM] Brian Cullinan:  will be ok
[04/29/2008 03:11:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: goodnight

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Crystal Diaz): Tue Apr 29 03:43:30 2008
[04/29/2008 03:43:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: I finally feel something other than infatuation towards you
[04/29/2008 04:02:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's a frustration. Maybe I took what you said wrong. But I don't mind this feeling at all, because it's new and definite, and something other than these naive uncontrollable romantic thoughts that don't have any real basis besides the longing for something sincere.

[04/29/2008 08:54:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: why are you frustrated?
[04/29/2008 08:55:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry to upset you
[04/29/2008 08:57:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm just frusturated cuz I've though about what we could be in an unrealisticway for all this time. Maybe frusturated isn't the right word, because I'm a little relieved
[04/29/2008 08:58:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm going to take ashower now
[04/29/2008 08:59:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've got a big day!
[04/29/2008 09:16:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: relieved?
[04/29/2008 09:17:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am like that guy at the end of the tunnel standing in the light, it doesn't really matter to you who he is just that he is there, not that you can see him you realize he is just another man.
[04/29/2008 09:17:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: i enjoy analogies
[04/29/2008 09:18:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: was there something specific i said or did?  i just don't want any of what you are feeling turn into anger towards me.  
[04/29/2008 09:25:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: * now that
[04/29/2008 09:26:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: Well it was when you specifically told me that I am into the *idea* of you
[04/29/2008 09:27:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i suppose that's a little bold of me, i didn't mean to try to psycho analyze you
[04/29/2008 09:27:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: you're not some faceless guy to me in a tunnel, but it is true that I don't know all of you, like your flaws and stuff
[04/29/2008 09:27:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's just you never said anything like that
[04/29/2008 09:28:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'm wondering if i should wear my dress to school
[04/29/2008 09:29:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: dresses are nice
[04/29/2008 09:30:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you want to know my flaws?
[04/29/2008 09:31:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'd hope time would reveal them
[04/29/2008 09:31:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/29/2008 09:36:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: you certainly know some of mine
[04/29/2008 09:39:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: so we are ok?
[04/29/2008 09:42:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: are you afraid I at least started out as thinking of you only as a scapegoat? I was kind of afraid I was just some girl you wanted to lay
[04/29/2008 09:42:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah we are okay
[04/29/2008 09:46:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: i nearly blocked u today to see how I felt after not talking to you for a while, like if i really missed it
[04/29/2008 09:51:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i wouldnt do that w/o telling you

[04/29/2008 11:21:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: so an answer to your query, i am sure you have a natural attraction to other guys, everyone does even when they are in a good relationship
[04/29/2008 11:22:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you would be more then just a good lay, i was going to recommend not sleeping together if you didn't get back together with steve, just as evidence of that
[04/29/2008 11:22:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: Steve there? is he like.. behind you? or on other side of room? I forgot that I don't have statistics today. You'd think I'd have it highlighted and circled in my calendar cuz its a cruddy class.
[04/29/2008 11:23:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: other side of the room, he looks pretty upset
[04/29/2008 11:25:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: he had me put "it's complicated" with him on facebook.

[04/29/2008 12:01:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i take back what i said, it was just speculation, i guess i said it because you made your decision about steve so quickly and that is what it seemed like
[04/29/2008 12:02:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i see you were just like frak the flixster movies invitation
[04/29/2008 12:03:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't like facebook applications
[04/29/2008 12:03:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i block them all

[04/29/2008 12:04:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just thought since you seem to have several on your profile, but i totally get it, I block everything else too.
[04/29/2008 12:05:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope that all your intentions were pure through this whole thing
[04/29/2008 12:06:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i felt bad when you thought that all i wanted was a good lay
[04/29/2008 12:06:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: a partly made my decision cuz i felt sorry for steve  and wanted people to like me and you again and i think it's a little possible something good can happen between me and him but I know theres always the "sorry, i tried, but i cant anymore"
[04/29/2008 12:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/29/2008 12:09:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably a good decision for now

[04/29/2008 12:16:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: Im wondering what you meant by saying something like it hit you or set you off when i said "im crying cuz im losing you"
[04/29/2008 12:18:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'd ask you about your type of person and what you last girlfriend was like, but I'm thinking I should put speaking notes on my presentation, and ask that later

[04/30/2008 04:51:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/30/2008 04:52:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: I didn;t want to inconvenience you by getting a ride home with you
[04/30/2008 04:52:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: it wouldn't be an inconvenience
[04/30/2008 04:52:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: we could have talked alone
[04/30/2008 04:53:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: I would have liked that after being in the same room with you for so long
[04/30/2008 04:53:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i didn't want to be tempted to not take you home
[04/30/2008 04:53:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[04/30/2008 04:53:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha.. what
[04/30/2008 04:53:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: '
[04/30/2008 04:53:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: s right these days?
[04/30/2008 04:53:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: what is right?
[04/30/2008 04:54:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: what's not wrong?
[04/30/2008 04:54:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: my feelings for you
[04/30/2008 04:54:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[04/30/2008 04:54:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was nice spending time with you, even though we were both busy
[04/30/2008 04:55:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad you came down
[04/30/2008 04:55:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: is it okay if I ask you the same questoins you asked me, or ask why you asked them?
[04/30/2008 04:55:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: .. or are you ready for bed?
[04/30/2008 04:55:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will stay up a few more minutes, what do you want to ask me?
[04/30/2008 04:56:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/30/2008 04:57:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: why;d you asked me if i felt like not dealing with any of this stuff anymore, and if steve and I werent together could YOU imagine us having a relationship?
[04/30/2008 04:57:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i think 
"Brian Cullinan says (9:40 PM): 
i am a pretty patient person, and i am also pretty easy to please, so i have never really minded long distance relationships" 
answers the first part
[04/30/2008 04:58:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i asked you the first part because i wanted to know if you were getting frustrated with all this, and i didn't want to make it worse
[04/30/2008 05:00:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: and if you and steve weren't together, maybe we wouldn't have gotten to know each other so well, maybe there would only be some sexual desire, but i would definitely want to explore being in a relationship with you
[04/30/2008 05:00:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh. im just feeling more and more like im putting on an act for steve
[04/30/2008 05:00:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: but im not fed up with the situation
[04/30/2008 05:00:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: are you?
[04/30/2008 05:01:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: nah, i'd rather see you work it out and be happy, if i have to take a little bit of shit from people to see that through then so be it
[04/30/2008 05:01:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you have a nice chat with David in the car?
[04/30/2008 05:02:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: There are many times where i just want to be like fuck steve and be with you, but I feel like I have to give me and steve a "try" again before it would be okay for us.
[04/30/2008 05:02:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: Um.. we talked about Nickelback and...
[04/30/2008 05:03:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe we were just listening to the song
[04/30/2008 05:03:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: makes sense what you said about giving it another try
[04/30/2008 05:05:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: I wanted to express my feelings for you in some sort of way all night, but i couldn't!!! but i don;t mind, it builds .. something between us
[04/30/2008 05:05:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i agree
[04/30/2008 05:05:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: being honest with each other whenever we can i good

[04/30/2008 02:12:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not too long.. 
[04/30/2008 02:12:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: just e-mail it
[04/30/2008 02:12:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah your right
[04/30/2008 02:12:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: bjcullinan@gmail.com
[04/30/2008 02:13:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: should be sent
[04/30/2008 02:14:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: kk
[04/30/2008 02:15:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: wow... sorry its so unformatted
[04/30/2008 02:15:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will read it in a bit
[04/30/2008 02:15:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok.. got it
[04/30/2008 02:16:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: after you get home you said you
[04/30/2008 02:17:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i read it
[04/30/2008 02:17:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: are going to sleep til 10? what about 31 cent scoop night?! We could get creme brule ice creme. 
[04/30/2008 02:17:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: cream.
[04/30/2008 02:17:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/30/2008 02:17:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/30/2008 02:17:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[04/30/2008 02:18:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh, so lets do this
[04/30/2008 02:18:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think it deserves an "lol!"
[04/30/2008 02:18:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know you are indepentent, and you should be making decisions for yourself
[04/30/2008 02:18:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i think it is unfair for steve to ask that of you
[04/30/2008 02:19:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't disagree that i would probably ask the same thing
[04/30/2008 02:19:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: just differently
[04/30/2008 02:19:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: but let us try to respect his wishes
[04/30/2008 02:19:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i want you to be committed to this decision
[04/30/2008 02:19:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know?
[04/30/2008 02:20:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know
[04/30/2008 02:20:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to influence anything, and i know that i can if i wanted to
[04/30/2008 02:20:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that is my reasoning
[04/30/2008 02:20:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I was just htinking today was good and last night was good... but if you are in it with me, then I can stop seeing you for a couple days
[04/30/2008 02:21:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am in it with you
[04/30/2008 02:21:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i won't like it
[04/30/2008 02:21:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i will do it for you
[04/30/2008 02:21:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and him
[04/30/2008 02:21:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe.. maybe it will even help us.
[04/30/2008 02:21:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: thank you Brian
[04/30/2008 02:21:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we will be able to talk online a bit
[04/30/2008 02:23:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the good thing is, if you decide to stay with him because of this then we will already be used to not hanging out in person and there won't be any temptations, AND if you decide to still break up with him, then you can be completely free of everything, and won't regret not giving it your all, or being distracted
[04/30/2008 02:23:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it works out for the both of us
[04/30/2008 02:23:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah.. he now wants to know if ive been seeing you, I said i've seen you. i'd expect him to ask to what capacity, oh wait he just did
[04/30/2008 02:23:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: just tell him you stopped by at my work
[04/30/2008 02:23:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is pretty harmless
[04/30/2008 02:24:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't like we are going to do something while i'm at work, infront of other people
[04/30/2008 02:25:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha yeah.. i said I stopped by at his work and we chatted with Jennay
[04/30/2008 02:26:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: (deliberate misspelling of her name)
[04/30/2008 02:26:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you promise him you won't see me until his date?
[04/30/2008 02:26:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: Yes
[04/30/2008 02:26:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: was he happy about that?
[04/30/2008 02:26:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: he really thanks me
[04/30/2008 02:28:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: k, that was my one good deed for the day
[04/30/2008 02:28:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-|
[04/30/2008 02:28:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: :|
[04/30/2008 02:31:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: fav pic?

[04/30/2008 02:32:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh you look good in all of them
[04/30/2008 02:32:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just have to pick one out
[04/30/2008 02:32:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll do it when i am not in class
[04/30/2008 02:32:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: nice idea.
[04/30/2008 02:33:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think im going to sleep, maybe when i wake up, you'll be asleep.. who knows
[04/30/2008 02:33:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: ttyl

[04/30/2008 05:16:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh, hey, cool
[04/30/2008 05:17:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve now wants me to stop talking to you online tonight tomorrow friday and saturday
[04/30/2008 05:17:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: so, you gonna change your prof pic or what..
[04/30/2008 05:23:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will as soon as i get home to edit it
[04/30/2008 05:23:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh i didnt realize you werent home! sorry
[04/30/2008 05:24:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: Im sorta thinking, well how is he gonna know if we talk? But I'm too honest to tell him I'll stop talking to you, but actually still talk to you. Will you stick in it with me through these few days  like the not seeing eachother thing? I just, want him to really feel like i'm trying. 
[04/30/2008 05:24:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: I know it effing sucks hard core
[04/30/2008 05:25:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: He says so many things to try and talk me into believing him about how much he loves me and how much he can change, but it kinda makes me like him less. I told him that.
[04/30/2008 05:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you are willing to give up all communication, then i guess i have no choice
[04/30/2008 05:25:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: AAHHH!
[04/30/2008 05:27:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes. Communication shall cease and I will be glum.
[04/30/2008 05:27:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: if glum is a word.
[04/30/2008 05:30:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: so is that what you want?
[04/30/2008 05:30:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: fuck no
[04/30/2008 05:31:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: that makes me happy
[04/30/2008 05:31:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: this will be okay
[04/30/2008 05:31:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what do we have to do?
[04/30/2008 05:32:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: not sure what you are asking
[04/30/2008 05:33:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: well I am going to have to delete your name from my messenger because it would just be distressing to see "Brian Cullinan"
[04/30/2008 05:36:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess... we could start not talking when we reach the end of this convo (you go home or I go to get notes from a friend)
[04/30/2008 05:36:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: I look forward to seeing your new prof pic.
[04/30/2008 05:36:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: or now

[05/05/2008 03:52:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: they keep reminding us and stuff.. i dont understand why they dont just keep it open through finals
[05/05/2008 03:52:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe down the line, even come visit you in NY if you would enjoy that

[05/05/2008 04:05:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: I have my compass checking because there is a store in town and I can use checks with it, and easily deposit checks and so on. I have an ING checking because it makes interest, though a little, so i keep most of my money in my Emigrant Direct Savings account, which actually has a really shitty APY lately, but has been up to like 5 %
[05/05/2008 04:05:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice
[05/05/2008 04:06:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: so... not sure what to do about Emigrant Direct and their 2.75% apy.. maybe i should move the money? but then id lose money of that time
[05/05/2008 04:06:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: they are here so im going to go

[05/05/2008 09:08:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: let me know if you change your midn
[05/05/2008 09:09:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i talk to steve?
[05/05/2008 09:09:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i should
[05/05/2008 09:09:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i told him before that i would not fight him for you, but now i certainly would
[05/05/2008 09:10:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: well. im not suer what would be better for him. He seems to want answers, but I think maybe just not talking to either of us mgith be better
[05/05/2008 09:10:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know
[05/05/2008 09:10:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: has he started an online convo?
[05/05/2008 09:10:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: if he does i suppose you can talk.. but keep it short cuz you both have to study!
[05/05/2008 09:10:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there anything that i could answer?  take some weight off your back?
[05/05/2008 09:11:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: just wondering.  back to studying
[05/05/2008 09:14:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: it seems pretty clear he is not going to stop talking to you and concentrate on school, maybe you should consider more assertive action like i took when he didn't want you to talk to me
[05/05/2008 09:15:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: Maybe!
[05/05/2008 09:18:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: you, you will tell me if you change your mind about tonight righT?
[05/05/2008 09:19:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: Thank you really for this morning!! It really made me happy all day
[05/05/2008 09:21:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad
[05/05/2008 09:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to come say goodnight to you
[05/05/2008 09:22:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you are in your pjs and all cozy and done with studying
[05/05/2008 09:22:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: k?
[05/05/2008 09:22:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: k
[05/05/2008 09:24:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: would that make you happy?
[05/05/2008 09:28:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: Yes it would
[05/05/2008 09:28:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: I was getting ready for bed
[05/05/2008 10:04:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am drawing
[05/05/2008 10:05:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: another David Smith picture? cmon
[05/05/2008 10:05:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: you should try to hide you feelings for him at least a little
[05/05/2008 10:13:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: to get starbucks or to not get starbucks
[05/05/2008 10:16:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve is bringing me a hanger, but he won't be here long, I'll let you know if we discuss anything
[05/05/2008 10:32:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: please do
[05/05/2008 10:34:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: He is gone
[05/05/2008 10:34:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you will like my cartoon
[05/05/2008 10:35:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you ok?
[05/05/2008 10:36:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: asked me a bit more about Friday and if I care that it happened or if i was just having a good time. Your roommate told the ACM room what happened, which is totally okay, but I think he made steve think things went down differently. I tried to set him straight. He also kept saying things like he didnt see this coming, and I said that I coouldnt keep trying with him because it was too stressful
[05/05/2008 10:36:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i am okay
[05/05/2008 10:37:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think i cried earlier mostly because I really like my privacy, and it makes me sad to think he isnt studying because of me
[05/05/2008 10:38:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i told him to study, he told me he has been going out with people so that he isnt alone, but it still doesnt help. kinda sucks for him, I told him that I wish there was something reasonable i could do to help, but I cant, and he understands that
[05/05/2008 10:38:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think ill get back to work now, I can't wait to see your cartoon
[05/05/2008 10:38:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: tell me when you want me to come say goodnight
[05/05/2008 10:39:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: or *if
[05/05/2008 10:39:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: if.. definitely, when.. that's up to you because I will be up later than you
[05/05/2008 10:39:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/05/2008 10:41:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree with you having your privacy, i think what he did is completely inappropriate, i hate it when people have done that to me
[05/05/2008 10:42:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: but just after you leave 105 seems reasonable
[05/05/2008 10:42:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[05/05/2008 10:47:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: he also mentioned something about us flaunting it, which I thought was a little ridiculous
[05/05/2008 10:47:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: but then he mentioned the facebook statuses like we
[05/05/2008 10:48:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: "have been in love for two years"
[05/05/2008 10:51:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[05/05/2008 10:51:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[05/05/2008 10:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: awww everyone thought it was cute
[05/05/2008 10:51:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: he should have realized the rick roll
[05/05/2008 10:51:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know i know! geeze
[05/05/2008 10:51:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: what a square
[05/05/2008 10:51:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol, he probably did
[05/05/2008 10:52:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: we didn't even touch when he was in the room with us the other day
[05/05/2008 10:52:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah i told him
[05/05/2008 10:53:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am crazy about you though
[05/05/2008 10:53:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we could really have something great
[05/05/2008 10:55:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean it already is great, and i think it will be great
[05/05/2008 10:55:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: ditto!
[05/05/2008 10:59:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: you've probably already told me, but why isnt there a bsg party this week?
[05/05/2008 11:01:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is
[05/05/2008 11:01:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: just not telling joe

[05/06/2008 12:26:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol..
[05/06/2008 12:26:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are not very dark for being mexican
[05/06/2008 12:26:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you get nice tans?
[05/06/2008 12:26:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: i just said yes, like usual
[05/06/2008 12:26:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: umm well i dont like to pay for a tan
[05/06/2008 12:26:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: so im usually like this
[05/06/2008 12:27:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: but sometimes my cousin, the one im talking to, gets me to go lay outside during the summer.. Most of my family is lighter than most mexicans, but still darker than a white person
[05/06/2008 12:28:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'd say i tan pretty nicely
[05/06/2008 12:28:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[05/06/2008 12:28:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[05/06/2008 12:29:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: but dont get your hopes up!
[05/06/2008 12:29:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: ive done the sunless spray on tanning at the salon, which always turns out nice
[05/06/2008 12:30:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: we are so going to a beach
[05/06/2008 12:30:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: I went to the warped tour last summer and still have a tan line on my shoulder from it. Im guessing that is not good. But i feel like im almost always covered up, and rarely swim, so im okay on the skin cancer/wrinkles front
[05/06/2008 12:30:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: ack.. really
[05/06/2008 12:31:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: you'll have to convince me
[05/06/2008 12:31:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: why, you don't like beaches!?
[05/06/2008 12:32:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's not that i dont like them.. i just don't go.. especially with my arm scars and such
[05/06/2008 12:32:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i'd love to go with you sometime, actually

And I had 127... so i added two pictures that i totally would have added anyway. And now we have the same amount of "photos of me". Then I noticed that you have 218 friends, and i had like 205... so I friend requested some people from your parties and stuff... and
[05/08/2008 12:24:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: now i have 213 friends
[05/08/2008 12:24:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: five more til i have the same as you

[05/08/2008 12:25:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: you're adorable
[05/08/2008 12:26:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: heh
[05/08/2008 12:27:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: i need 6 more nau friends to have the same number of nau friends as you... and you have the same number of nau friends as you do pictures of yourself.. that's weird

[05/08/2008 12:30:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh, not for you!
[05/08/2008 12:30:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[05/08/2008 12:30:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean just for relationships in general
[05/08/2008 12:30:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: ah i see
[05/08/2008 12:30:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean you will have to tell me if steve does this
[05/08/2008 12:30:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: but he seems like kind of a n00b
[05/08/2008 12:31:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: okkk
[05/08/2008 12:32:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i don't mean to put him down
[05/08/2008 12:32:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: or anything
[05/08/2008 12:33:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i think you will enjoy it
[05/08/2008 12:33:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: Im just wondering what is that you are going to do that he probably hasnt done because of his n00b status
[05/08/2008 12:34:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: not that i want you to tell me what it is.. just why him being a noob keeps him from doing it
[05/08/2008 12:34:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i guess I'll understand tomorrow
[05/08/2008 12:34:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: well maybe he has done it
[05/08/2008 12:34:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: you will have to tell me
[05/08/2008 12:34:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: but not every guy is as sweet as me
[05/08/2008 12:35:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: it really isn't that big of deal
[05/08/2008 12:35:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: right now i'm feeling like our relationship is a bit..../.,...,.,,,..,./..,,..,......surreal. Like it feels so good to be with you, that I'm kind of in the clouds
[05/08/2008 12:35:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tend to talk it up a lot
[05/08/2008 12:35:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: you don't think it will last?
[05/08/2008 12:36:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: wha.. no nothing like that. It is hard to explain.
[05/08/2008 12:36:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: Like it hasn't hit me yet
[05/08/2008 12:36:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: but at the same time, what we have is so real. I can't describe what I'm feeling, i guess.
[05/08/2008 12:37:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: you could....
[05/08/2008 12:37:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: try
[05/08/2008 12:37:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: I.. am
[05/08/2008 12:37:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty understanding
[05/08/2008 12:40:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: It hasn't totally sunk in.. how lucky I am to have you. And when i say "my boyfriend" I think, oh yeah I have a boyfriend!!!, and he is so good to me.
[05/08/2008 12:40:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i get it
[05/08/2008 12:40:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that is very cute
[05/08/2008 12:41:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: you get it, sigh.
[05/08/2008 12:42:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel...
[05/08/2008 12:42:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: nervous
[05/08/2008 12:43:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: a little, because steve won't back off.  and because you are so amazing to me that i am maybe more cautious then normal.
[05/08/2008 12:44:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: We are holding hands skipping in the woods and i havent really accepted that at some point we will cross the tree line and hit a highway and have to decided to go separate ways or like.. cross together, but I know when the time comes we will be ready to cross together. And hopefully not get ran over.
[05/08/2008 12:45:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: steve steve ugh.
[05/08/2008 12:45:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i like your analogy
[05/08/2008 12:46:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: more cautious, how do you mean?
[05/08/2008 12:47:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: Steve won't back off with you? or with me? or with us?
[05/08/2008 12:47:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: won't back off us, and let things play out
[05/08/2008 12:48:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't blame him
[05/08/2008 12:48:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: cautious in sarcasm for example, like the women being bad drivers
[05/08/2008 12:49:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: still don't get
[05/08/2008 12:50:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: like i don't really believe that women are bad drivers, because that is sexist and a generalization, but i joke about it just from things i observe
[05/08/2008 12:50:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: like my mom talking on her cell phone while driving
[05/08/2008 12:50:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tease her about it, but i generalize it
[05/08/2008 12:50:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: out of sarcasm
[05/08/2008 12:50:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i was cautious when i joked with you tonight
[05/08/2008 12:52:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: like you would have made it an even bigger joke or bigger deal (even though still sarcast), but you didn;t cuz you were being cautious?
[05/08/2008 12:52:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: exactly
[05/08/2008 12:53:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: or last night when you made a joke about you mexican cousin not having internet you hinted because she is mexican, but i asked you to explain anyways
[05/08/2008 12:54:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just don't think we have quite caught on to each other's sarcasm, and i have kind of a strange sense of humor
[05/08/2008 12:54:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: huh.. i see.
[05/08/2008 12:55:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: is that weird?
[05/08/2008 12:55:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: So.. you are being cautious because maybe if you arent then you think maybe I would like you less, or at least not take it the right way?
[05/08/2008 12:55:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[05/08/2008 12:55:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: not take it the right way
[05/08/2008 12:56:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i should just relax
[05/08/2008 12:56:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i know what we have is great
[05/08/2008 12:56:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: weird, no. I think it would be nice to understand eachothers sense of humor and sarcasm, and maybe relaxing is the best way to do that
[05/08/2008 12:56:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: but maybe all new relationships are like that to an extent
[05/08/2008 12:56:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: hey, i know it too!
[05/08/2008 12:57:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: back to work time?
[05/08/2008 12:57:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: exactly what i was thinking
[05/08/2008 12:57:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: like.. exactly
[05/08/2008 12:57:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: 1 AM
[05/08/2008 12:58:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: need brighter light!
[05/08/2008 12:58:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: talk to you later?
[05/08/2008 12:58:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: of course
[05/08/2008 12:59:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: sarcasm is the only thing i have been cautious about, i am otherwise being completely genuine with you
[05/08/2008 12:59:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe you should point it out so that im sure.
[05/08/2008 12:59:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: at first

[05/08/2008 03:16:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't save wiskey bottles

[05/08/2008 11:57:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: Or do you just want to see my big O polynomial face

[05/13/2008 12:30:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i have no idea where to start with the visualizations 
[05/13/2008 12:30:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: let me grab one and post it
[05/13/2008 12:32:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4872)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4872
[05/13/2008 12:32:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[05/13/2008 12:32:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure what to make of it
[05/13/2008 12:33:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should download it under my account
[05/13/2008 12:33:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: and take a look at the visualization and the definition files
[05/13/2008 12:34:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: wow
[05/13/2008 12:34:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe
[05/13/2008 12:34:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you could tell me anything about how it is calculated i would be super impressed
[05/13/2008 12:34:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol.. i'll think about it
[05/13/2008 12:35:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: k
[05/13/2008 12:35:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: How can i download it under your account and look at it?
[05/13/2008 12:36:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/Media/Media%20Players/Sound%20Spectrum/G-Force_373_Platinum.exe)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/Media/Media%20Players/Sound%20Spectrum/G-Force_373_Platinum.exe

[05/13/2008 12:42:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: so whats up?
[05/13/2008 12:44:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: What's up is that I like "Castles in the Sky" and I can't find the "Cycling Dots" visualization you sent me the code for 

[05/13/2008 12:45:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/13/2008 12:47:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: Im looking through the files
[05/13/2008 12:48:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: you go to the g-force directory
[05/13/2008 12:48:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: then under wave shapes
[05/13/2008 12:48:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes..
[05/13/2008 12:48:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: called tri-cycling dots
[05/13/2008 12:51:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: thanks
[05/13/2008 01:07:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: What do you think ID means?
[05/13/2008 01:08:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: IDentification
[05/13/2008 01:08:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: is that what it means?
[05/13/2008 01:09:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont know.. its either a 0 or 1.
[05/13/2008 01:16:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have been working on my site
[05/13/2008 01:18:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: In the particular one you sent me..... there's an X0 Y0, X1 Y1, X2 Y2 which makes snese b ecause there are three rows of circles, each having 11 circles (steps?).. the X0 Y0 is the middle row... the X1Y1 is the top row which is like the middle row but shifted up by .5 and squished in both directions by .5, and the X2Y2 is the bottom row shifted down by .5 and squished in both directions by .5
[05/13/2008 01:19:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: The B1 and B2 tell the dot where to be using a sin and cos function.. i feel like everything 9im saying is obvious
[05/13/2008 01:20:01 AM] *** You have been disconnected. Tue May 13 01:20:01 2008.
[05/13/2008 01:20:09 AM] *** "Crystal Diaz" signed on at Tue May 13 01:20:09 2008.
[05/13/2008 01:20:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't obviousl
[05/13/2008 01:20:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: *obvious
[05/13/2008 01:20:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that really helps
[05/13/2008 01:21:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: B0 is the time parameter used in B1 and B2, and I guess it involves the current time in relation to the initial time
[05/13/2008 01:21:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: did you get my other two IMs?
[05/13/2008 01:21:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: not usre what "s" is, which is used in C0
[05/13/2008 01:22:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i got the other IMs
[05/13/2008 01:22:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: when ID = 0, B1 is sin( t)/8, when ID=1, B1 is -sint/8
[05/13/2008 01:22:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i dont know how ID changes
[05/13/2008 01:22:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: Num = 2 explains why there is two dots in each circle... wonder what would happen if i change it to .. 5
[05/13/2008 01:22:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: 4
[05/13/2008 01:26:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: any change?
[05/13/2008 01:27:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes more dots
[05/13/2008 01:27:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[05/13/2008 01:28:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: sweet
[05/13/2008 01:29:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: im changing numbers and seeing what happens but Im not sure how i can help generally
[05/13/2008 01:30:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: could S be the synthesizer level?
[05/13/2008 01:31:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: because each dot moves to the beat
[05/13/2008 01:33:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: well.. when I change C0 = 2s -1 to C0=4s-1 the circles arent close together anymore, like the centers moved twice as far away.. to the right, and changing it to C0=4s+1 totally moved the center of the first circle to the right by 2, so now i only see have a circle in the middle thats all the way on the right side......... SOO s.. might... have to do withhhhh
[05/13/2008 01:33:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: position
[05/13/2008 01:34:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think A0, A1,B0 have more to do with the beat/speed... 
[05/13/2008 01:36:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: fft might be flowfield time or soemthing
[05/13/2008 01:36:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/13/2008 01:36:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are going to have to help me with my interpreter
[05/13/2008 01:37:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: LWdt means line width diameter?
[05/13/2008 01:39:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/13/2008 01:39:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: yup
[05/13/2008 01:40:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: so are you going to stay up all night with me?
[05/13/2008 01:41:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: you must be tired from driving

[05/13/2008 01:47:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: Theres a home business commercial with a fox that says "Crazy like a fox!!!", so if i ever say "like a fox" that;s why
[05/13/2008 01:48:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i get it

[05/13/2008 03:03:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: When I;m on show=15 and type something new at the top that has less than 15 results, it still keeps me on the show=15 page, even though there are only 2 results (then i have to press prev to get them)
[05/13/2008 03:04:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: Im going to move my sister and start unpacking
[05/13/2008 03:12:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are really helpful
[05/13/2008 03:14:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made it reset when you do a search
[05/13/2008 03:15:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: good
[05/13/2008 03:15:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'll think about it more later... I was reading about DEFCON when I was trying to get my sis to fall asleep
[05/13/2008 03:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: now to get the search form to stick when you submit it
[05/13/2008 03:20:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am toying with the idea of having a scrollbar on the left that changes to the size of the results but uses ajax to only display the number of visible items at a time
[05/13/2008 03:20:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: to save memory of course
[05/13/2008 03:22:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you have an RSS aggregator?
[05/13/2008 03:23:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: just the one firefox provides

[05/13/2008 03:41:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: WHy don't you use Windows Vista?
[05/13/2008 03:41:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't like it
[05/13/2008 03:47:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is a memory hog
[05/13/2008 03:47:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think there are things in it that are harder to use
[05/13/2008 03:54:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh i understand
[05/13/2008 04:00:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yay it saves form data now!

[05/13/2008 06:04:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: Leah claims steve participated in it before me, and prefers that i don't go because it would be awkward.
[05/13/2008 06:04:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: dude go.. how else are you guys going to get over it!
[05/13/2008 06:05:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont you have a class together next semester?

[05/13/2008 06:07:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean Leah was all like "Steve is going to be there". and it starts at 6
[05/13/2008 06:07:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah.. i was chatting on line with him a little
[05/13/2008 06:07:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: darn
[05/13/2008 06:07:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't really mind if you talk to him
[05/13/2008 06:07:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay, I dont talk to him much, and not about anything personal
[05/13/2008 06:08:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i hope it isn't awkward when we touch on things that happened in your last relationship
[05/13/2008 06:08:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just trying to get to know you, and the things you like
[05/13/2008 06:08:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would never expect details
[05/13/2008 06:08:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: It's not awkward for me, in face sometimes i think of saying something about my last relationship but stop myself
[05/13/2008 06:09:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: then do i usually end up asking anyways?
[05/13/2008 06:10:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: sometimes actually
[05/13/2008 06:10:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: Some guy came to my door for my vote for counter supervisor
[05/13/2008 06:10:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: county
[05/13/2008 06:10:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when i was talking to my mom i said "i guess i will have to tone down the racism", i was totally joking.  if i make a racist joke it is only out of jest.
[05/13/2008 06:11:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: *if i make a racist comment
[05/13/2008 06:11:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha, I don't mind
[05/13/2008 06:11:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm totally used to it
[05/13/2008 06:12:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: sometimes i make a comment or two, but mine always seem less in a joking manner, so I just end up looking like a racist
[05/13/2008 06:12:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i have to reiterate this because you are mexican, which is a little silly, you are my girlfriend first
[05/13/2008 06:12:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: But I'm no racist!
[05/13/2008 06:14:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. im trying to connect to my drives at school.. so far i've only been able to connect to my dana.ucc.nau.edu

[05/13/2008 06:21:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could set up remote desktop

[05/14/2008 09:14:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah she didn't seem very interesting
[05/14/2008 09:14:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: she was pretty messy too
[05/14/2008 09:15:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: like.. leaving stuff around and dirtying the sink area
[05/14/2008 09:15:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/14/2008 09:15:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: we would play soap chicken
[05/14/2008 09:15:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: or .. toilet paper chicken
[05/14/2008 09:15:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is that?
[05/14/2008 09:16:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: .. running low, who is going to be the first to give up and buy new soap or TP???!
[05/14/2008 09:16:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb

[05/14/2008 09:21:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[05/14/2008 09:22:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: trying to think of how to proceed on my site
[05/14/2008 09:22:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: You seem to have a lot of time on your hands
[05/14/2008 09:22:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: Must be nice
[05/14/2008 09:23:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it is
[05/14/2008 09:23:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am not making any money
[05/14/2008 09:23:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will be eating soup for the next 3 weeks
[05/14/2008 09:23:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: soon
[05/14/2008 09:23:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh soup.
[05/14/2008 09:24:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so
[05/14/2008 09:24:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: what to talk about
[05/14/2008 09:24:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should ask you something personal
[05/14/2008 09:24:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: I was looking up Breitling watches
[05/14/2008 09:25:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: My mom showed me one that is apparently $50,000 that she wants to get rid of
[05/14/2008 09:25:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: Yes, you should ask me something personal
[05/14/2008 09:25:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think she means 5,000
[05/14/2008 09:26:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: but its a lot of diamonds so who knows
[05/14/2008 09:26:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds cool
[05/14/2008 09:26:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you have a personal question in mind?
[05/14/2008 09:26:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do not
[05/14/2008 09:26:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you?
[05/14/2008 09:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: still thinking of something
[05/14/2008 09:27:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you ever go on dates with steve?
[05/14/2008 09:28:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is your idea of the perfect date?
[05/14/2008 09:29:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: Perfect Date is probably June 6th because it's the next time I'll see you in flagstaff, and on that day it is not too hot and not too cold in flagstaff.
[05/14/2008 09:30:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i meant describe what you would do on your perfect date
[05/14/2008 09:31:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know what you meant = ), I just wanted to say something silly while I was thinking
[05/14/2008 09:31:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve and I went on a few dates, but really not many, and they mostly consisted of eating at some place
[05/14/2008 09:32:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: we shopped a couple times with just us, but shopped a few more times with his family in Vegas
[05/14/2008 09:32:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/14/2008 09:32:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: We also went to see Cirque du Soleil: KA, and Phantom of the Opera with the parents
[05/14/2008 09:32:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'll get around to your other question soon
[05/14/2008 09:34:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: or now
[05/14/2008 09:34:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit
[05/14/2008 09:34:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: what?
[05/14/2008 09:34:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i always wanted to take a girl to Ka
[05/14/2008 09:34:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we will just have to see O instead
[05/14/2008 09:35:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw, sorry, i'm sure O would be nice too
[05/14/2008 09:36:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: KA is good I'd see it again
[05/14/2008 09:38:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't know if you've seen any of those MTV dating shows, like elimidate style one, but they tend to do a lot of creative things on those dates, and the reason I bring it up is because my perfect date doesnt necessarily have to have anything really creative, I think simple is nice, so my perfect date might involve eating, maybe cooking together would be better than a restaurant, then
[05/14/2008 09:41:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: fun
[05/14/2008 09:41:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: go on
[05/14/2008 09:41:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: then I've always enjoyed walking around a bookstore, maybe with a coffee place in it, so that we can get a drink, sit and talk about eachother, and then at the end of the date I've always wanted to take a special person to a place that overlooks the city or where stars can be seen easily, like by a lake or by the observatory in flagstaff, or at a place we used to call "The Rock" in Tucson
[05/14/2008 09:42:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: The date might, instead of the bookstore, involve minigolf at golf n stuff, or going to a fair with rides, but fairs are hard to come by, so there is always castles and coasters in phx, I don't think a water park is very date like
[05/14/2008 09:43:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: castles and coasters sucks
[05/14/2008 09:43:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: If in VEGAS, we'd go to a fancy restaurant where people dress very nicely, and then go to a SHOW, and maybe maybe hit the bars
[05/14/2008 09:44:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i could take you to cedar point
[05/14/2008 09:44:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol, nice and blunt
[05/14/2008 09:44:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg you would cream
[05/14/2008 09:44:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: OMG, wow Brian, geeze
[05/14/2008 09:44:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: Where is Cedar Point?
[05/14/2008 09:44:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love cedar point
[05/14/2008 09:45:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: well then, now you tell me your idea of a perfect date
[05/14/2008 09:45:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: besides cedar point, wherever that is

[05/14/2008 09:49:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think my perfect date would include long walks on the beach
[05/14/2008 09:49:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love the beach
[05/14/2008 09:51:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: long walks on the beach, lol
[05/14/2008 09:52:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: no, I think that's way cute, I've just never done it, I was laughing cuz it cliché, and my boyfriend is not cliché
[05/14/2008 09:53:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know
[05/14/2008 09:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am so not cleche
[05/14/2008 09:54:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: *cliché
[05/14/2008 09:56:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: When you said  I love you, my heart felt so many things, and then i said "oh stop it" but I was saying that to myself, telling myself to stop feeling all giddy inside, but I liked it and didn't mea it
[05/14/2008 09:56:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: didn't mean the "oh stop it"
[05/14/2008 09:56:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: totally meant the I love you too
[05/14/2008 09:56:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's ok

[05/14/2008 10:04:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's frustrating

[05/17/2008 05:45:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/17/2008 05:45:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you really want to talk to him?
[05/17/2008 05:45:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: /16/2008  1:46:28 PM  Crystal Diaz  *red+u Steve  i thought you blocked me or something  
5/16/2008  2:28:09 PM  *red+u Steve  Crystal Diaz  i did but i just decided i'd rather just not talk to u... i like it better this way, so now u know  

[05/17/2008 05:46:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: no, I just have things to say to him that I would like answers to
[05/17/2008 05:47:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/17/2008 05:47:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i guess the best you can do is leave him messages
[05/17/2008 05:48:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: when I was talking to Travis I asked him to tell me what you like
[05/17/2008 05:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: aw
[05/17/2008 05:49:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: who am i supposed to ask what you like?
[05/17/2008 05:49:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe jenny
[05/17/2008 05:49:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should ask steve
[05/17/2008 05:50:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: and one thing he said was that your favorite language is PHP, and that It would be cool if I could write something in PHP
[05/17/2008 05:50:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: no steve!
[05/17/2008 05:50:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think Leah encouraged steve to not talk to you
[05/17/2008 05:50:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: Leah does a lot of encouraging
[05/17/2008 05:50:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe you should hold off, and figure things out later
[05/17/2008 05:50:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, maybe
[05/17/2008 05:50:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: it makes me feel baf
[05/17/2008 05:50:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: bad
[05/17/2008 05:50:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: how come?
[05/17/2008 05:51:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is probably good for you guys not to talk for a while
[05/17/2008 05:51:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is the only way you will be able to move on
[05/17/2008 05:51:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: my sister is dancing to the put a banana in your ear song!
[05/17/2008 05:51:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: It's the first time he is doing soemthign that is putting him in control
[05/17/2008 05:51:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean, aside from that time where he said he didnt want us to talk or see eachother
[05/17/2008 05:53:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: so.. i feel a little helpless i dont know,
[05/17/2008 05:54:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am not sure it's bad that I feel, but different because I felt like I was doing all these things that he had no control over and now i feel a tiny bit of what he might have felt
[05/17/2008 05:55:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/17/2008 05:55:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: well you can't let him control you
[05/17/2008 05:55:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i g2g help dave take apart his desk
[05/17/2008 05:55:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok byt4ewop['
[05/17/2008 05:56:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wants you to feel this way
[05/17/2008 05:56:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wants you to feel bad
[05/17/2008 05:56:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is very selfish
[05/17/2008 05:56:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: because he knows you can be happy with me
[05/17/2008 05:56:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he is trying to turn good feelings with me, into bad feelings
[05/17/2008 05:56:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: by taking control and ignoring you, he is getting back at you
[05/17/2008 05:57:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: You should go help Dave, i'll think about it
[05/17/2008 05:57:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe that is what he felt, but he is just doing it to make you unhappy
[05/17/2008 05:57:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love you crystal
[05/17/2008 05:57:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll do anything to make you happy
[05/17/2008 05:57:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: brb
[05/17/2008 06:13:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: So then after the conversation with Travis I decided I should come up with some way I can write something in PHP
[05/17/2008 06:18:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: then you said stuff about taking pictures when I was in bed on the phone with you. I then got the idea to make a php photo album. But then soon found out that php doesnt seem as simple to initiate as html.
[05/17/2008 06:18:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: So I was going to ask you how to even install whatever to do php, even though i wanted it to be a suprise
[05/17/2008 06:19:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: but David Smith told me what to do and now I have it working
[05/17/2008 06:19:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/17/2008 06:19:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are so cute
[05/17/2008 06:19:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you install wamp?
[05/17/2008 06:19:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: And then, I realized making a photo album would be hard
[05/17/2008 06:19:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/17/2008 06:19:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: no I just put it on my dana website
[05/17/2008 06:19:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, cool
[05/17/2008 06:20:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: (Link: http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~cd84/aside/test1.php)http://dana.ucc.nau.edu/~cd84/aside/test1.php
[05/17/2008 06:20:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: hah

[05/17/2008 06:28:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was a great idea
[05/17/2008 06:28:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to show you how to do some things in php, then you can do it
[05/17/2008 06:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: like read files from a directory
[05/17/2008 06:31:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can read all the picture files
[05/17/2008 06:31:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: nice

[05/19/2008 03:15:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: the lady did the best she can do over the phone
[05/19/2008 03:15:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone should come out and take a look
[05/19/2008 03:15:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: and to make it better she'd have to send a technician which would cost 59

[05/19/2008 03:16:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: no they should send one out for free if it is the first time
[05/19/2008 03:16:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: they should have charged that when setting it up
[05/19/2008 03:16:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would have fought with her
[05/19/2008 03:17:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: Brian, my dad has been really wanting to have a meal with my sisters and me, and my sister told me that he really has something to tell us
[05/19/2008 03:17:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then she said it is about my little brother, but she doesn't know what it is
[05/19/2008 03:17:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh oh
[05/19/2008 03:17:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you worried?
[05/19/2008 03:17:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: so I don't know what to think
[05/19/2008 03:17:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[05/19/2008 03:17:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: how old is he?
[05/19/2008 03:17:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: Like, why the secrets if its something good?
[05/19/2008 03:17:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/19/2008 03:18:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: 10
[05/19/2008 03:18:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe they discovered a learning disability
[05/19/2008 03:18:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: if it's something bad, how do i tell my mom
[05/19/2008 03:18:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: when he was pretty young they said he was slower in development than other kids
[05/19/2008 03:18:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: your mom isn't allowed to see him
[05/19/2008 03:18:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: right
[05/19/2008 03:19:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe just wait
[05/19/2008 03:19:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't tell her when you find out
[05/19/2008 03:19:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait until things change and you will know when it is right
[05/19/2008 03:19:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: the people at his school know my mom by face and name by my dad telling them to not let my mom come anywhere near him
[05/19/2008 03:19:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[05/19/2008 03:20:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't like to get in the middle, but when she puts me there I don't really have the guts to put my foot down and say no
[05/19/2008 03:20:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/19/2008 03:20:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: so she asked me to go to the front office of his school which might not even be his school anymore, i dont know, and buy the yearbooks for this year and last year
[05/19/2008 03:20:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would if i were in your situation
[05/19/2008 03:21:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i went to the office and when i told the ladies its for Alfredo Diaz they got all defensive and I got outta their quick because I didnt want to be there just as much as they didn't want me there
[05/19/2008 03:22:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: weird
[05/19/2008 03:22:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like you need to talk to your dad
[05/19/2008 03:22:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you ever figure out why your mom can't see her son?
[05/19/2008 03:23:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz its forbidden!
[05/19/2008 03:23:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think its a court thing
[05/19/2008 03:24:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/19/2008 03:24:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: you mean more of the circumstances behind it, like why the court decided that?
[05/19/2008 03:24:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah hmm
[05/19/2008 03:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/19/2008 03:24:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can ask today since my meeting with my father seems pretty serious already because he wants it to just be me and my sisters, no children
[05/19/2008 03:25:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont really see much point in telling my dad about the yearbook incident
[05/19/2008 03:25:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably not
[05/19/2008 03:25:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: I got in, got out, and nothing happened
[05/19/2008 03:25:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you might bring it up that your mom would like pictures of him?
[05/19/2008 03:26:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: perhaps
[05/19/2008 03:26:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: my dad always gets weird when i take a picture that has my brother in it with my phone or camera, and he's like "be careful with those"
[05/19/2008 03:26:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh
[05/19/2008 03:27:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i heart you brian!
[05/19/2008 03:27:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe make the argument that it is her son and even if she can't see him in person, she doesn't have to be so tortured to never get to see him
[05/19/2008 03:27:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: ya nice
[05/19/2008 03:27:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and maybe next time something comes up with your mom, remind her that eventually he will be 18, and he will seek her out
[05/19/2008 03:29:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[05/19/2008 03:29:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: you're a great person

[05/19/2008 03:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: also i don't know how your relationship with your dad is, but you might want to express that you never wake sides, good idea to remain neutral when it comes to this stuff
[05/19/2008 03:41:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think he knows im not a side taker
[05/19/2008 03:41:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: im more.. like too out of the know to even take a side
[05/19/2008 03:41:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: does/did your salad have cucumber?!
[05/19/2008 03:42:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like cucumber a lots

[05/22/2008 10:00:19 PM] *** Crystal Diaz is trying to send you "dinner052008.txt"
[05/22/2008 10:00:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: how come?  she won't see what your doing
[05/22/2008 10:01:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: hear
[05/22/2008 10:01:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb
[05/22/2008 10:02:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: hear?
[05/22/2008 10:02:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, on the phone
[05/22/2008 10:02:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i started reading
[05/22/2008 10:02:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like a really bad situation to be in
[05/22/2008 10:03:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh we dont have to do it on the phoen
[05/22/2008 10:03:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean your mom must have really done something bad, to have restrictions like that
[05/22/2008 10:09:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: r u done reading?
[05/22/2008 10:09:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: not yet
[05/22/2008 10:09:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna go wash my face and brush my teeth
[05/22/2008 10:13:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am finished
[05/22/2008 10:14:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: this all seems very delicate, and it hurts me to see you caught in the middle of this type of thing
[05/22/2008 10:17:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the best thing to do, and i tell my sister this, is realize the mistakes your parents make, and learn from their example.  my father can never hold down a steady relationship, so i constantly have examples of things NOT to do in relationships
[05/22/2008 10:19:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: im baack
[05/22/2008 10:21:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: I have always pretty much been in the middle
[05/22/2008 10:22:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: She did a lot of stuff to Melly, and I had my share of stuff done to me, but not so much
[05/22/2008 10:23:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont really know much about what happened with Sonia, but I know there were things
[05/22/2008 10:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i c
[05/22/2008 10:23:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: things were like.. she was either cool with you or totally not cool with you, and it could change in a matter of seconds because of some little thing
[05/22/2008 10:24:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats a big thing of borderline personality
[05/22/2008 10:24:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/22/2008 10:24:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is a little crazy
[05/22/2008 10:24:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: I've always been afraid of getting Borderline personality disorder
[05/22/2008 10:24:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: ... like me?!
[05/22/2008 10:24:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: "oh i have those too!"
[05/22/2008 10:25:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is why you have to realize these tendencies your parents have and things that you do
[05/22/2008 10:25:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: strive to be better
[05/22/2008 10:25:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: in everything you do
[05/22/2008 10:25:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: it helps that my dad said my mom showed signs even at the beginning of the relationship
[05/22/2008 10:25:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i try
[05/22/2008 10:26:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've never been bad with steve
[05/22/2008 10:26:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i believe that i overcame my A.D.D. tendencies just by realizing what i do, and getting in the habit of not behaving that way
[05/22/2008 10:27:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: my father is extremely manipulative, it is really a marketing skill he has perfected
[05/22/2008 10:27:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he uses it against us
[05/22/2008 10:27:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: the worst ive done is just thinking things to sabotage my feelings towards him, but it was never projected to him, for example i'd... 
[05/22/2008 10:27:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. 
[05/22/2008 10:27:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: can you remember an example?
[05/22/2008 10:28:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: things to sabotage your feelings for him?
[05/22/2008 10:28:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: e.g. i'd think he doesnt like me.. i dont know.. cant really think of anything! i did it really early on in the relationship but got over it cuz it was stupid
[05/22/2008 10:29:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/22/2008 10:29:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've matured
[05/22/2008 10:29:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: my father is good at turning arguments around making you think that everything you do is wrong, and he is always right
[05/22/2008 10:29:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: he has not matured
[05/22/2008 10:30:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: well sometimes i'd say things and hurt his feelings
[05/22/2008 10:30:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i deal with him by constantly caressing his feelings and ego.  i always make him feel like he is the most important person, and constantly project my respect for him and his wishes.
[05/22/2008 10:31:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: is that hard for you?
[05/22/2008 10:31:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: it comes easily for me, when i am around him
[05/22/2008 10:31:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: because its an exaggeration
[05/22/2008 10:31:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[05/22/2008 10:31:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: other people who know me well can tell when i am doing it
[05/22/2008 10:31:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he just goes with it
[05/22/2008 10:31:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess you gotta do what you gotta do, I'm glad you are able to handle it well
[05/22/2008 10:32:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is what you should do
[05/22/2008 10:32:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean find something that you can do to handle things
[05/22/2008 10:32:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: to make your relationship better with your parents
[05/22/2008 10:32:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that you can better understand them and the right and wrong things you do
[05/22/2008 10:33:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think it was a good idea to go ask for yearbooks, but i also think that if you had known the situation better you would have said no
[05/22/2008 10:33:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is something that should go through your father
[05/22/2008 10:34:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is never a good idea to mess with the court system like that, it will just make the restrictions more harsh
[05/22/2008 10:34:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: "this is some serious shit" is what i am trying to say
[05/22/2008 10:34:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry i was messing with my mp3 player
[05/22/2008 10:34:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: coming from a divorced family i have seen the types of problems people have
[05/22/2008 10:34:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont think it is a good idea for me to get recent pics for her
[05/22/2008 10:35:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: of my brother (we call him chiquito, but his name is Alfredo like my dad)
[05/22/2008 10:35:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: not a good idea because.. it will get her thinking
[05/22/2008 10:35:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: she is safely preoccupied with her baby daughter
[05/22/2008 10:35:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes good idea
[05/22/2008 10:36:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: does your mother take medication?
[05/22/2008 10:37:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[05/22/2008 10:37:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: she was against the diagnosis']\\
[05/22/2008 10:38:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is a mistake, there is nothing wrong with trying treatment, even if at the time you think it is wrong, it may turn out that it helps you see things in a different light
[05/22/2008 10:38:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone that denies treatment of a professional is prideful
[05/22/2008 10:39:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[05/22/2008 10:40:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: omgwtf
[05/22/2008 10:40:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: my left earphone doesnt work
[05/22/2008 10:41:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb
[05/22/2008 10:41:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: okay
[05/22/2008 10:41:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: does anything i am saying make sense?  i feel like you aren't really acknowledging much of it.
[05/22/2008 10:41:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: never mind!
[05/22/2008 10:41:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: it works
[05/22/2008 10:42:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe just taking it into consideration quietly?
[05/22/2008 10:42:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol.. i have too much earwax.
[05/22/2008 10:42:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry i know thats gross
[05/22/2008 10:42:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh babe i am!
[05/22/2008 10:42:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: It makes a ton of sense
[05/22/2008 10:42:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[05/22/2008 10:42:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I sort of felt the same way when i was talking to you yesterday after work
[05/22/2008 10:43:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you feel like you got to know me better, or have you like forgotten everything i said
[05/22/2008 10:43:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel a lot closer to you
[05/22/2008 10:43:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i really want to be there for you
[05/22/2008 10:43:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: you're sweet
[05/22/2008 10:43:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you go through hard times, or have disagreements
[05/22/2008 10:43:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to be there for you to run away to
[05/22/2008 10:44:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: my door and heart are always open to you
[05/22/2008 10:44:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I want to be able to tell you everything.. and so far i think i have done a good job
[05/22/2008 10:45:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know you are smart and will make the right choices, i just worry about you because understanding your parents decisions in life can be hard
[05/22/2008 10:46:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like Boom Boom Ba by Metisse
[05/22/2008 10:46:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: what genre is it?
[05/22/2008 10:46:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: its.. 
[05/22/2008 10:46:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: ..the same as Dido?
[05/22/2008 10:47:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: with a piano
[05/22/2008 10:47:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont know.. my parent's decisions aren't as hard to understand as you might think
[05/22/2008 10:48:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: My dad made decisions out of logic and love for his kids
[05/22/2008 10:50:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/22/2008 10:51:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: Dani called
[05/22/2008 10:52:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: It's true that my mom's actions are radical or shocking and make no sense but its fair to understand that the actions are due to her illness
[05/22/2008 10:53:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: the hard thing was dealing with the decisions
[05/22/2008 10:53:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: her "alleged" illness
[05/22/2008 10:53:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: and.. i feel through all this
[05/22/2008 10:53:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats what i thought of saying ha
[05/22/2008 10:53:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/22/2008 10:53:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: ..i feel because of all this.. it has made me a little numb
[05/22/2008 10:54:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: numb?
[05/22/2008 10:54:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: to emotional pain?
[05/22/2008 10:54:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: fucked up my ability to open up, fucked up my ability to feel strong negative feelings
[05/22/2008 10:55:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know how to put it because im not even sure what i mean
[05/22/2008 10:55:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i feel it
[05/22/2008 10:57:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: When we were talking about things my sister Melly cried a couple times
[05/22/2008 10:57:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: but I just felt curiousity
[05/22/2008 10:57:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like Mad World by Gary Jules
[05/22/2008 10:57:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like Donnie Darko
[05/22/2008 10:58:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe she experienced things differently then you
[05/22/2008 10:58:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: that is certainly possible
[05/22/2008 10:58:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know my mom did worse things to her
[05/22/2008 10:58:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: she probably has a completely different perspective because you have been kept somewhat in the dark, and she was exposed to more/worse circumstances
[05/22/2008 10:59:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: and its really hard to say if my sister will ever forgive her
[05/22/2008 11:00:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/22/2008 11:00:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you have any specific questions about the writing
[05/22/2008 11:00:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i understand what happened
[05/22/2008 11:00:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: she saw my little sister once
[05/22/2008 11:00:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: elaborations?
[05/22/2008 11:01:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: extrapolations?
[05/22/2008 11:01:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should talk more in person about it sometime
[05/22/2008 11:01:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: masturbations?
[05/22/2008 11:01:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[05/22/2008 11:01:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty sleepy, and i have to go to the bathroom
[05/22/2008 11:01:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay hun

[05/27/2008 01:11:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hi love
[05/27/2008 01:11:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: hi!
[05/27/2008 01:12:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: "glad".. kinda a strange word
[05/27/2008 01:12:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: you had another movie question for me
[05/27/2008 01:12:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: im on my "lunch break"
[05/27/2008 01:12:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you ever seen equilibrium?
[05/27/2008 01:13:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think i caught a bit on an NAU library movie channel, but not fully, looks like something i might be interested in.
[05/27/2008 01:14:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is really cool, i am waiting for it to come out on bluray
[05/27/2008 01:15:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: is there a plan for it to come out on blu-ray or are you just hoping?
[05/27/2008 01:15:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: just hoping
[05/27/2008 01:16:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha okay
[05/27/2008 01:16:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: put it on the list?
[05/27/2008 01:17:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: will do
[05/27/2008 01:21:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I bet Christina was more sane than me.
[05/27/2008 01:22:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: eh, sane in a different way
[05/27/2008 01:22:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: or crazy in a different way
[05/27/2008 01:23:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol i think i get it... maybe
[05/27/2008 01:31:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill talk to you about it later

[05/27/2008 02:08:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: send to me later?
[05/27/2008 02:24:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: RAID 5?! tell me about that. if you are there.
[05/27/2008 02:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was in the shower
[05/27/2008 02:26:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: did steve tell you about RAID5?
[05/27/2008 02:27:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes, a basic definition, because he wanted to set one up.
[05/27/2008 02:27:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/27/2008 02:28:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundant_array_of_independent_disks
[05/27/2008 02:30:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha.. i went tehre already
[05/27/2008 02:32:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: you.. shower.. mmm
[05/27/2008 02:32:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: so for every block on the drive there is 2 sets of parity bits that fill that block, but the parity block is rotated between all the drives
[05/27/2008 02:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: the picture is probably more helpful
[05/27/2008 02:33:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RAID_5.svg)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:RAID_5.svg
[05/27/2008 02:34:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so since there is an entire drive's worth of parity blocks, you can afford to lose 1 drive and still have all the data
[05/27/2008 02:34:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: a large file is split up onto several drives?
[05/27/2008 02:34:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[05/27/2008 02:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can't think of it in terms of files but yes potentially 1 files can be split up on to several drives
[05/27/2008 02:35:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you think of it in terms of "blocks" which can be an arbitrary size, but they are like markers in the superblock that controls the IO
[05/27/2008 02:36:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: ur msrt
[05/27/2008 02:36:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean
[05/27/2008 02:36:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: ur smrt
[05/27/2008 02:38:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[05/27/2008 02:43:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: any closed surface is homeomorphic to a sphere, a connected some of n tori, or a connected sum of m real projective planes. The euler characteristic of n tori is 2-2n and of m projective planes is 2-m, and the sphere has an euler characteristic of 2, making it esentially the connected sum of 0 tori.
[05/27/2008 02:44:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are smart too
[05/27/2008 02:44:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i almost forgot. =(
[05/27/2008 02:44:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: =)
[05/27/2008 02:48:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: someday..... someday you should walk me through what you are doing when you do something cool with your server
[05/27/2008 02:48:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[05/27/2008 02:50:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i know you know i want you to do that.
[05/27/2008 02:53:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: Can I telly ou that I still feel a little vulnerable with you
[05/27/2008 02:53:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should feel vulnerable with me
[05/27/2008 02:53:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel vulnerable around you
[05/27/2008 02:54:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wouldnt think it's the same vulnerable though.
[05/27/2008 02:54:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of vulnerable?
[05/27/2008 02:58:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: like any moment you are going to be like "okay.. I've had enough of your shenanigans... thanks for the head... you're a little too nuts/weird... turns out I don't like you as much as i made it seem or thought I did... bye"
[05/27/2008 02:58:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg
[05/27/2008 02:59:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: man the head is great
[05/27/2008 02:59:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i felt really safe and comfortable Steve
[05/27/2008 02:59:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am crazy for you
[05/27/2008 02:59:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: with
[05/27/2008 02:59:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't mind your crazy
[05/27/2008 02:59:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've known crazier people
[05/27/2008 02:59:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not going anywhere babe
[05/27/2008 03:00:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: our relationship is still new, so i know it must be hard to think anything could happen
[05/27/2008 03:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i know for sure i want to be with you
[05/27/2008 03:01:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: I know these feelings will die down eventually
[05/27/2008 03:01:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: what kind of vulnerable is it for you?
[05/27/2008 03:01:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: the same
[05/27/2008 03:02:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think any day you could leave me for some better CS guy, and thinking about you being away in NY for a year! drives me nuts.
[05/27/2008 03:02:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: but then i remember how much i trust you
[05/27/2008 03:02:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i know that something like that would never happen
[05/27/2008 03:03:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: I;m not going anywhere either.
[05/27/2008 03:03:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like you soo much, it's embarassing.
[05/27/2008 03:04:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: see, that's how i feel
[05/27/2008 03:04:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you have to trust me, and know that i really like you
[05/27/2008 03:04:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: more then anyone!
[05/27/2008 03:04:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are amazing to me
[05/27/2008 03:04:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: I mean it would be embarassing if i showed even half of what I want to do because of you
[05/27/2008 03:05:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahaha, you can always tell me about it!
[05/27/2008 03:06:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: Today.. for just a moment.. I thought of going onto I-10 West, not I-10 East.
[05/27/2008 03:06:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: then thought how disruptive that would be to my life and went on with my day
[05/27/2008 03:07:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: I guess I'll have to really take our pact to heart!
[05/27/2008 03:07:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: and trust you
[05/27/2008 03:07:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: and know that you really like me

[05/27/2008 03:53:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i havent seen you cry.
[05/27/2008 03:56:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's very sad
[05/27/2008 03:57:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: this show alone has made me more sensitive
[05/27/2008 03:58:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's Grey's Anatomy for you. 
[05/27/2008 03:58:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: making guys all over the United States more sensitive
[05/27/2008 04:01:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: would you tear up if I were with you watching it?
[05/27/2008 04:02:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/27/2008 04:02:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably
[05/27/2008 04:02:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think you did for The Fountain.. but i cant remember if you were referring to the first time you saw it or that time you saw it with me
[05/27/2008 04:03:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: that one makes me tear up
[05/27/2008 04:03:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm so easily tear jerked!
[05/27/2008 04:09:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: if we did a php private photo album, how fast would that be compared to sending an email? I feel like an email has to do more stuff when its in little peices above our heads. I guess it sucks that I have a pirated version of Outlook, otherwise things would be faster.
[05/27/2008 04:09:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: (totally kidding about peices above our heads, but I like to joke)
[05/27/2008 04:10:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should set up wamp
[05/27/2008 04:17:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: if uh you really think i should.
[05/27/2008 04:18:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: need some convincing (because I am intimidated), then help (because i'd try by myself in some sort of way of trying to prove myself, but just end up admitting i need help anyway)
[05/27/2008 04:19:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will help you
[05/27/2008 04:22:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: this girl in the show has borderline personality disorder
[05/27/2008 04:22:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: ack.. i wonder if they portray it right
[05/27/2008 04:22:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz sometimes they dont potray bipolar disorder correctly
[05/27/2008 04:23:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/27/2008 04:23:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: even though there are two types.
[05/27/2008 04:23:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i only really know about mine, but i think they are kinda the same.. where frequency of mania vs depression is different
[05/27/2008 04:24:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: im glad i dont have borderline personality disorder.
[05/27/2008 04:25:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it seems pretty bad
[05/27/2008 04:26:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: Statistically i guess there is a chance i can get it... but if i dont have it by now, and if I am strong, take my pills, and remember  what it has done in my life, I'll be okay

[05/27/2008 05:08:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: I thought him telling me that he has realized i'm not just in a phase meant that he was getting over it, and would be okay with you, but i guess not.

[05/27/2008 05:20:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: it has a white one... and connected to the white one is a splitter that makes it two blue females.. and my monitors have white ones so i need two blue penis/white penis cords, but i only have one.. and the other is a white penis white penis
[05/27/2008 05:21:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: think i have an extra white to blue.. but i just think thats weird
[05/27/2008 05:21:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could ask someone for the missing cord
[05/27/2008 05:22:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh.. i was given an extra one last summer.. ill just use that one, and then at the end of the summer ill take it or the white white i have here.. whichever seems more useful
[05/27/2008 05:23:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/27/2008 05:26:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to tell you stuff

Unfortunately, Raytheon will not cover any expenses associated with your move to New York to start school.  They will only cover your return trip and household goods move home to Flagstaff, AZ

[05/27/2008 08:03:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve arcas said your ex-boyfriend kind of treated you like a trophy
[05/27/2008 08:04:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: ...
[05/27/2008 08:05:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: `.
[05/27/2008 08:05:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: .000000000+
[05/27/2008 08:06:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: sry spilled beer on keyboard
[05/27/2008 08:06:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that made me feel better about what happened
[05/27/2008 08:06:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: !
[05/27/2008 08:06:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you deserve better then that
[05/27/2008 08:06:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe you dont get what he means
[05/27/2008 08:07:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ... maybe being treated like a trophy was supposed to mean a good thing
[05/27/2008 08:07:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: not the way he said it
[05/27/2008 08:07:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: it also means like an arm ornament
[05/27/2008 08:07:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: something pretty
[05/27/2008 08:07:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: a thing that you win
[05/27/2008 08:07:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what he meant
[05/27/2008 08:08:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think you took it the wrong way.. im not agreeing with Steve Arcas but he must mean that he treated me like a princess
[05/27/2008 08:08:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: not the way steve said it, in context it meant the other thing
[05/27/2008 08:09:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: he said it like "they weren't right for each other, he kind of treated her like a trophy"
[05/27/2008 08:09:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean it doesn't have to be a bad thing
[05/27/2008 08:09:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess

[05/27/2008 10:32:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: babe it doesnt bother me that you have oral herpes
[05/27/2008 10:32:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm sorry i didn't tell you right away
[05/27/2008 10:32:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i understand why you didnt tell me, i guess it was kind of a personal question
[05/27/2008 10:33:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: and now i see what you meant about flaws.
[05/27/2008 10:33:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: it makes me see you more as a person than just a boyfriend
[05/27/2008 10:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: it just i really took 
 "You have to dole out your crazy in little pieces,
 You can’t do it all at once." to heart
[05/27/2008 10:34:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm not sure what i would have thought back then if you told me
[05/27/2008 10:34:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol yeah!
[05/27/2008 10:34:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: I guess i would have asked you how oral herpes works
[05/27/2008 10:35:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: and kissed your fingers.
[05/27/2008 10:35:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: as you told me
[05/27/2008 10:36:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: You saying you were scared makes me feel closer to you
[05/27/2008 10:36:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, it is not likely to spread if you don't have a breakout, in the oral case a sore like a cold sore, but it is still possible
[05/27/2008 10:37:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: so it wasn't transmitted sexually.
[05/27/2008 10:37:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is estimated that 50 to 80 percent of the worlds population has it
[05/27/2008 10:37:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[05/27/2008 10:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: my last girlfriend had oral herpes
[05/27/2008 10:37:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i kissed her when she had a sore
[05/27/2008 10:37:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: because she didn't know what it was
[05/27/2008 10:37:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i didn't think
[05/27/2008 10:38:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh goodness
[05/27/2008 10:38:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm curious about how she got it
[05/27/2008 10:38:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: shared a soda
[05/27/2008 10:38:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah me too
[05/27/2008 10:38:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: wowee
[05/27/2008 10:39:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we had kissed before and i never got it, it was one of the last times that she had a sore
[05/27/2008 10:39:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: so then, when did you first get a sore?
[05/27/2008 10:39:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said she had it since she was younger, which concerns me, when since she was 5
[05/27/2008 10:40:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i first got it, i had tons of sores on my lips it was really painful, but since then it has only been 1 at a time
[05/27/2008 10:40:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: musta shared a popsicle
[05/27/2008 10:40:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: it used to be about once a month, then about once every two months
[05/27/2008 10:40:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i told my dad, and he admitted to having it too
[05/27/2008 10:40:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: tons of sores... oh no
[05/27/2008 10:41:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i took some of his pills that his doctor prescribed for it, and i haven't had it since
[05/27/2008 10:41:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh he did
[05/27/2008 10:41:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh thats cool
[05/27/2008 10:41:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you just took them for a bit once?
[05/27/2008 10:41:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: or kept taking them?
[05/27/2008 10:41:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took 2 at one time
[05/27/2008 10:42:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ooh
[05/27/2008 10:43:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wonder if like.. people know.
[05/27/2008 10:43:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you mean?
[05/27/2008 10:43:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: from seeing your lips back when it was showing up
[05/27/2008 10:43:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont car
[05/27/2008 10:43:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: e
[05/27/2008 10:44:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/27/2008 10:44:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: ...just wondering
[05/27/2008 10:44:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: .
[05/27/2008 10:44:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i covered it up well
[05/27/2008 10:45:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: You should let me know if you feel a sore coming on
[05/27/2008 10:45:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[05/27/2008 10:45:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course
[05/27/2008 10:49:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: I was being hypocritcal
[05/27/2008 10:50:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: about what?
[05/27/2008 10:51:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you not tell me something when i asked?
[05/27/2008 10:54:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: I remember that once at Fronske they told me i had a low risk form of HPV, and i think i took something for it, and I dont know if it was true because then it was like i didnt have to take anything anymore and i was okay again, but i dont think HPV is like.. "curable", I never had genital warts or anytthing, but i think maybe its like.. i have it but its not doing anything
[05/27/2008 10:54:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I kind of forgot becasue they made it seem like not a big deal
[05/27/2008 10:56:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm wikipediaing it
[05/27/2008 10:57:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/27/2008 10:59:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: does that bother you?
[05/27/2008 11:00:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[05/27/2008 11:00:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: does it bother you that i didnt tell you
[05/27/2008 11:00:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought of it really once before tonight, that was when i remembered, but couldnt tell you at the time
[05/27/2008 11:02:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: well
[05/27/2008 11:02:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think you meant not to tell me
[05/27/2008 11:02:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like i didn't mean to not tell you about the weed
[05/27/2008 11:03:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the herpes thing was another thing that drove my last girlfriend and i apart
[05/27/2008 11:03:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: because she was ignorant about it
[05/27/2008 11:03:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow
[05/27/2008 11:03:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it was really painful for me
[05/27/2008 11:04:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and had i known, it all could have been prevented
[05/27/2008 11:04:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: just physically painful?
[05/27/2008 11:04:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: even if i got it, i still could have just taken a pill and made it go away
[05/27/2008 11:04:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes it could have
[05/27/2008 11:04:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had sores all over my lips
[05/27/2008 11:04:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my gums swelled up
[05/27/2008 11:04:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was very painful
[05/27/2008 11:04:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but then i took a pill and it was gone
[05/27/2008 11:04:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: thank you so much for telling me now
[05/27/2008 11:05:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but like i said, now that i know what it is and i can treat it, there is very low risk that i will pass it on to you
[05/27/2008 11:05:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you don't have to be afraid of making out with me
[05/27/2008 11:07:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: okey dokie

[05/28/2008 10:04:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: would like to remote desktop
[05/28/2008 10:04:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think it is still setup for it
[05/28/2008 10:06:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: i set up my online verizon account a moment ago. I didnt realize i had unlimited in picture text
[05/28/2008 10:06:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: 68.63.185.191
[05/28/2008 10:08:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: is it possible to block a computer from remote desktoping to another computer?

[05/28/2008 10:09:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: well i slept in
[05/28/2008 10:09:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: you shouldn't have to block a computer because you have to enter a username and password
[05/28/2008 10:09:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: woke up at 7:50... no shower
[05/28/2008 10:10:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm, well i dont know my username
[05/28/2008 10:10:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: your user name should just be Crystal
[05/28/2008 10:10:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: what does it say if you type the wrong credentials.. do you type the ip in the first box that says computer?
[05/28/2008 10:10:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is whatever you sign it at home with
[05/28/2008 10:10:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: it seems like its the name
[05/28/2008 10:10:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: i only put a password at home, so i forgot my username
[05/28/2008 10:11:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes IP goes in the first box
[05/28/2008 10:11:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: guess i need my remote computer name too
[05/28/2008 10:11:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh.
[05/28/2008 10:11:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: did i happen to give you my username and pword?
[05/28/2008 10:11:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: username is Crystal
[05/28/2008 10:11:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: password is whatever you set it when i told you to make one
[05/28/2008 10:12:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i tried it with the saved and it didn't work
[05/28/2008 10:12:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you remove the password?
[05/28/2008 10:12:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[05/28/2008 10:12:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: can you try and tell me what it says when you try
[05/28/2008 10:12:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: it says it can't log me in
[05/28/2008 10:12:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i have the wrong credentials
[05/28/2008 10:12:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: it says for me: This computer can't connect to the remote computer. Try connecting again.
[05/28/2008 10:13:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: put 68.63.185.191 in the computer box
[05/28/2008 10:13:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is all
[05/28/2008 10:13:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: it specifically says cuz its the wrong credentials or are you saying that is what it is implying?
[05/28/2008 10:13:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is what that message means
[05/28/2008 10:13:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: so you get the same as me?
[05/28/2008 10:13:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: no
[05/28/2008 10:13:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, i'
[05/28/2008 10:13:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can connect
[05/28/2008 10:14:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: m just trying to figure it out
[05/28/2008 10:14:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i connect and it brings up the login dialog
[05/28/2008 10:14:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: me too
[05/28/2008 10:14:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: and when i try the information you gave me before it says it is the wrong username and password
[05/28/2008 10:15:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: it says "The system could not log you on."
[05/28/2008 10:15:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: and some other crap
[05/28/2008 10:15:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay well it must be my computer then
[05/28/2008 10:15:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that means you have the wrong username or password
[05/28/2008 10:15:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: is your other monitor on?
[05/28/2008 10:15:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: i mean if it is possible to block remote desktop to a computer, then it makes sense for raytheon to block it
[05/28/2008 10:15:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[05/28/2008 10:15:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think
[05/28/2008 10:15:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: you could try fix it using VNC
[05/28/2008 10:15:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: want me to log on an take a look?

[05/31/2008 02:43:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's not even what i meant to say
[05/31/2008 02:44:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: .. but sleeping in cuz you slept late doesnt mean lazy.. lazy means sitting around not doing anything at all
[05/31/2008 02:44:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: or.. went to bed late i mean

[05/31/2008 02:45:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i love pretty dirs
[05/31/2008 02:45:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: mod_rewrite roxoroxoroxorz
[05/31/2008 02:45:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. ok
[05/31/2008 02:46:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: so.. I'm not exactly, to be honest, seeing much difference compared to three days ago
[05/31/2008 02:46:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you have to change the little detail dropdown
[05/31/2008 02:46:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: hold on
[05/31/2008 02:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is where the different is
[05/31/2008 02:46:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is all controlled by the template system
[05/31/2008 02:48:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok lemme try
[05/31/2008 02:49:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow~
[05/31/2008 02:50:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: The search is like "fuck the limit, I'll give you everything!"
[05/31/2008 02:50:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah what;d you do!
[05/31/2008 02:52:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/31/2008 02:52:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/31/2008 02:53:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: the limit thing needs refinement 
[05/31/2008 02:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you change the detail value to like 4 you can see the info in a table
[05/31/2008 02:53:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[05/31/2008 02:55:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont see it right
[05/31/2008 02:56:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: nothing between submit, reset and get the list
[05/31/2008 02:56:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: but when i do ?detail=4 at the end i get stuff
[05/31/2008 02:57:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: shit its fucking up
[05/31/2008 02:57:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's because you set the detail too high it disappeared
[05/31/2008 02:57:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am currently away from the computer.
[05/31/2008 02:57:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was curious
[05/31/2008 02:59:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: fixed
[05/31/2008 02:59:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: so... now when i get stuff to play in WMP, instead of saying file for all of them, it says the name and artist and stuff?
[05/31/2008 03:00:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that too
[05/31/2008 03:01:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's still sort of counterintuitive
[05/31/2008 03:01:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: like.. so many buttons and .. so many i dont know!
[05/31/2008 03:02:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[05/31/2008 03:03:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the modularity of it makes it extremely robust
[05/31/2008 03:03:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow.. it keeps the older stuff in WMP that i picked earlier
[05/31/2008 03:03:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/31/2008 03:04:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm listening to our current facebook song =)
[05/31/2008 03:04:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/31/2008 03:06:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: how does it remember what i did last?
[05/31/2008 03:07:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[05/31/2008 03:07:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: from the save button
[05/31/2008 03:08:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a thing called a session
[05/31/2008 03:08:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can basically put anything in it
[05/31/2008 03:08:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: any piece of information
[05/31/2008 03:08:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh cool

[05/31/2008 03:09:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: but it wont be liek that forever!
[05/31/2008 03:10:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: =(
[05/31/2008 03:11:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: before, it used to buffer or whatever and play the song, but now its doing that but it is also downloading

[06/03/2008 07:58:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think someday
[06/03/2008 07:58:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is just no other girl i am comfortable with like that
[06/03/2008 07:59:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd fuck in the same room as joanna and keifer
[06/03/2008 07:59:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: that would be hot
[06/03/2008 07:59:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: because its always a competition between keifer and i
[06/03/2008 07:59:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but as far as swapping or the tag team, probably not
[06/03/2008 08:00:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: like.. i wouldnt think so, but then when i read that I got turned on
[06/03/2008 08:00:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: fucking in the same room is wild enough for me
[06/03/2008 08:01:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer is all about the tag team
[06/03/2008 08:01:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but joanna is too prude
[06/03/2008 08:01:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: what.. how does he know
[06/03/2008 08:01:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: has he done that?
[06/03/2008 08:01:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: or does he just love the idea?
[06/03/2008 08:01:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: he just really wants to do it
[06/03/2008 08:01:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: Not sure about that
[06/03/2008 08:01:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: he keeps talking to joanna about a 3 way with me
[06/03/2008 08:02:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't think she is very attractive, and she doesn't want to
[06/03/2008 08:02:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats strange that he keeps talking about it
[06/03/2008 08:02:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wouldnt mind doing things with joanna
[06/03/2008 08:02:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean he just brought it up before
[06/03/2008 08:02:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: but no one wants to feel left out
[06/03/2008 08:02:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[06/03/2008 08:02:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[06/03/2008 08:02:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: i see
[06/03/2008 08:02:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: Why dont i ever see him online?
[06/03/2008 08:02:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: who would be left out?
[06/03/2008 08:02:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have no clue
[06/03/2008 08:02:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: not sure why i said that
[06/03/2008 08:02:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: he doesn't go online much
[06/03/2008 08:02:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[06/03/2008 08:03:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: im going to get some food.

[06/03/2008 08:03:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: it could be fun
[06/03/2008 08:09:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess if there was someone i wanted a 3 way with, i would have to know them for a while, be friends with them
[06/03/2008 08:09:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am currently idle.
[06/03/2008 08:09:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: know about their past sex life a little
[06/03/2008 08:11:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess that makes sense
[06/03/2008 08:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but theoretically i guess i am open to the idea
[06/03/2008 08:13:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just don't want you to leave me for a girl
[06/03/2008 08:13:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg i would never!

[06/03/2008 08:18:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought a 3 way with nicole would be hot, but i later found out she was a little gross from dave
[06/03/2008 08:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: if there someone you had in mind?
[06/03/2008 08:19:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: a little gross
[06/03/2008 08:19:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't have to be a girl
[06/03/2008 08:19:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said she only gets off from ass to mouth
[06/03/2008 08:19:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ass to mouth is not sanitary
[06/03/2008 08:19:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wouldnt want a threesome with a guy
[06/03/2008 08:20:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: im good at ass to mouth
[06/03/2008 08:20:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: Ah im just kidding!
[06/03/2008 08:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: you've gone ass to mouth?
[06/03/2008 08:20:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: I bet i can get her off mouth to clit
[06/03/2008 08:20:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i havent done ass to mouth
[06/03/2008 08:20:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: for more than a second
[06/03/2008 08:21:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont have anyone in mind
[06/03/2008 08:21:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you think you are good at oral?
[06/03/2008 08:21:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: particularly
[06/03/2008 08:21:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean oral with a girl?
[06/03/2008 08:21:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think i am good
[06/03/2008 08:21:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: with a girl yes
[06/03/2008 08:21:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[06/03/2008 08:21:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: even though i havent done it to a girl in years
[06/03/2008 08:21:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: I feel like I know what i want enough to know what many women want
[06/03/2008 08:21:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess it helps to have someone with their own set of tools
[06/03/2008 08:21:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[06/03/2008 08:22:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think it would be cool to go down on a girl
[06/03/2008 08:22:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: just to see if i am good at it
[06/03/2008 08:23:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha yeah

[06/03/2008 08:26:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: totally
[06/03/2008 08:29:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the best kind of "seeing the future" would be if stuff just showed up in your memory as past memories that you could refer too
[06/03/2008 08:30:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: I;ve always thought seeing the future was kinda... strange
[06/03/2008 08:30:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it would be fun
[06/03/2008 08:30:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: you can see it, you can change it
[06/03/2008 08:30:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: then it's not true anymore

[06/03/2008 08:33:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am not particularly a fan of nic cage unless his life is going down the shitter, like in Weatherman and Lord of War
[06/03/2008 08:33:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that is the one

[06/07/2008 10:26:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good
[06/07/2008 10:28:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: you need to be more sloppy, less delicate, more tongue, but not too hard, i like soft, but really wet, and i like it switching from circles for 2 parts (thought not sure if i like it clockwise or counter clockwise) and then to left and right all fast for 4 parts and jamming your face down and sucking on it for 1 part and then
[06/07/2008 10:30:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is very detailed
[06/07/2008 10:33:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: theres more
[06/07/2008 10:33:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: The side to side or left to right thing i said might have to be with your whole head and loose tongue
[06/07/2008 10:34:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe
[06/07/2008 10:34:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: not sue
[06/07/2008 10:34:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: sure
[06/07/2008 10:34:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'll have to figure out the tongue "loose" or "tight" thing in person
[06/07/2008 10:34:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: you knwo what i mean.. relaxed and contracted?

[09/15/2008 10:15:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know what you want
[09/15/2008 10:16:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you have to be more specific
[09/15/2008 10:16:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: ah, well, i guess i could uh be more specific or just say forget about it
[09/15/2008 10:16:53 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no!
[09/15/2008 10:16:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you brought it up
[09/15/2008 10:17:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now you have to remind me
[09/15/2008 10:17:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want you to go out of your way
[09/15/2008 10:17:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what was it?
[09/15/2008 10:17:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: i went to a jewelery store once and they asked if i wanted to buy a teddy bear for a good cause.. like some childrens hospital
[09/15/2008 10:17:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: and that wasnt out of my way
[09/15/2008 10:18:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: i guess a teddy bear is easiest, but i dont want you to go out of your way!
[09/15/2008 10:23:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think i should just have you forget about it
[09/15/2008 10:23:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: i already have two teady bears i like
[09/15/2008 10:23:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont have them here, but one is one that Karan gave me and the other is the st. jude one that i gave steve but he gave back to me when we broke up
[09/15/2008 10:25:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[09/15/2008 10:25:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sounds to me like you need a new teddy bear
[09/15/2008 10:26:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i think when i find the right one it will just jump out at me
[09/15/2008 10:26:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i looked at the walmart and target, but they dont seem to have classics
[09/15/2008 10:26:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah thats what im thinking!
[09/15/2008 10:26:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you know because the hallmark ones always have those hard joints, they aren't soft enough
[09/15/2008 10:26:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: id like you to keep it in the back of your mind, but im afraid you'll forget
[09/15/2008 10:26:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and some are too soft they would get torn up easily
[09/15/2008 10:26:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i dont want to remind you
[09/15/2008 10:26:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: but if you see it, i guess you will remeber
[09/15/2008 10:26:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will remember now
[09/15/2008 10:29:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: thanks dude

[09/15/2008 10:29:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you really just call me dude?
[09/15/2008 10:30:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think it would be okay if it was with another gift like a usb drive or somethign
[09/15/2008 10:30:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes dude
[09/15/2008 10:30:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: pictures on a usb drive?
[09/15/2008 10:30:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's a good idea
[09/15/2008 10:30:29 AM] Crystal Diaz:  was there sometime before wherey ou said you didnt want me to call you dude?

[09/15/2008 10:31:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: but that is a good idea.
[09/15/2008 10:31:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: you deserve a bday gift!
[09/15/2008 10:36:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: because i think you said once that you dont think you did
[09/15/2008 10:37:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[09/15/2008 10:37:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yesterday
[09/15/2008 10:37:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when i hung up on you
[09/15/2008 10:37:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i felt bad
[09/15/2008 10:37:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: aw honey
[09/15/2008 10:38:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: glad we talked about it
[09/15/2008 10:38:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: in the past i let thigns go too much
[09/15/2008 10:43:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: im getting the samsung cuz someday i might care about the 2ms response over the 5ms and i think the 8000: 1 dynamic contrast ratio is better than the 2500: 1 dyn contrast ratio.. though i dont really understand why samsung say 8000:1 dynamic, 1000:1 native
[09/15/2008 10:44:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[09/15/2008 10:44:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: native is better
[09/15/2008 10:44:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: but acer doesnt say
[09/15/2008 10:44:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it means that it will try to make it look like 8000 using software
[09/15/2008 10:44:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: native means that it is built into the hardwarte
[09/15/2008 10:44:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: it just say 2500:1
[09/15/2008 10:44:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[09/15/2008 10:44:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: i see
[09/15/2008 10:49:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: yay free shipping!
[09/15/2008 10:50:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233047)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233047
[09/15/2008 10:50:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i like that one
[09/15/2008 10:51:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you order already?
[09/15/2008 10:51:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: no i didnt order already
[09/15/2008 10:51:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233042)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233042
[09/15/2008 10:51:43 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i also like that one
[09/15/2008 10:51:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably higher capacity is better
[09/15/2008 10:52:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the smaller one has a programmable lcd screen!
[09/15/2008 10:52:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh cute!
[09/15/2008 10:53:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would not order the samsung
[09/15/2008 10:53:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: a high native contrast ratio is better then the higher dynamic contrast ratio
[09/15/2008 10:54:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if i was going to buy a new monitor today...
[09/15/2008 10:54:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: acer doesnt give native
[09/15/2008 10:54:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009125)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009125
[09/15/2008 10:54:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if it doesn't say dynamic, then it is native
[09/15/2008 10:54:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: it says 2500 dynamic and samsung has 8000 dynamic so im assuming acer has lower native as well
[09/15/2008 10:55:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the first 2 are asus not acer
[09/15/2008 10:55:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: acer only says dynamic.. well some places online it says that.. newegg it doesnt say ither
[09/15/2008 10:55:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: wah?
[09/15/2008 10:56:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: ni?
[09/15/2008 10:56:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009145)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009145
[09/15/2008 10:56:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 2500:1?
[09/15/2008 10:57:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009138)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009138
[09/15/2008 10:57:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz it has a nicer base =)
[09/15/2008 10:57:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: and otherwise seems the same except for rating
[09/15/2008 10:57:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009153)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009153
[09/15/2008 10:58:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: i did like that one too.. but i thought it was too much money
[09/15/2008 10:59:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would buy an LG monitor before i bought one from samsung or viewsonic
[09/15/2008 10:59:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes i thought lg would be nice too
[09/15/2008 11:00:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow.. the last one you sent is really nice

[09/15/2008 11:01:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my 24 inch is like 1500 contrast
[09/15/2008 11:01:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[09/15/2008 11:01:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you aren't going to notice the difference
[09/15/2008 11:01:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: o
[09/15/2008 11:01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: response time is more important
[09/15/2008 11:01:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: really, i thought that was like only good for gaming
[09/15/2008 11:01:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but even then, 5ms is fast enough
[09/15/2008 11:01:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: i see
[09/15/2008 11:01:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't even play video games

[09/15/2008 11:02:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i have owned acer stuff
[09/15/2008 11:02:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: you should recall that i have a samsung and its been fine
[09/15/2008 11:02:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my ferrarri was an acer and the display was really nice
[09/15/2008 11:03:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[09/15/2008 11:03:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: i thought i had made my choice.. but now!
[09/15/2008 11:03:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: viewsonic and samsung and mitsubishi have always just been the bottom shelf electronics for me
[09/15/2008 11:04:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: its hard to beat the last Acer you sent me
[09/15/2008 11:04:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: :-P

[09/15/2008 11:13:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like my ps3 doesn't work on my monitor, even with an hdmi converter because it doesn't support that type of signal
[09/15/2008 11:13:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but with that monitor it would

[10/25/2008 11:30:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean .... you'll have to cut it and somehow bring it together like how people sew fabric?
[10/25/2008 11:30:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to sew it on to underarmor in the same positions as the seams
[10/25/2008 11:30:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh cool
[10/25/2008 11:31:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: make sense?
[10/25/2008 11:31:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[10/25/2008 11:31:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: you can do some rough estimates based on a shirt and pants you have
[10/25/2008 11:32:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[10/25/2008 11:32:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i estimated the size
[10/25/2008 11:32:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it looks about right
[10/25/2008 11:32:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are about 10 holes in 2 inches
[10/25/2008 11:32:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and when i compares my arms to the one in the picture
[10/25/2008 11:32:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it looks about right
[10/25/2008 11:34:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i like the look of how the armor fits together, i think i will be able to hook a bunch of pieces together so it is removeable from the under armor
[10/25/2008 11:36:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i love you
[10/25/2008 11:36:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i love you to!

[12/03/2008 08:50:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am watching heroes
[12/03/2008 08:50:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: cute
[12/03/2008 08:50:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i was thinking
[12/03/2008 08:50:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: uhhuh?
[12/03/2008 08:50:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we had a great relationship right?
[12/03/2008 08:50:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like it was amazing
[12/03/2008 08:50:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: in a way yes
[12/03/2008 08:50:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we could talk about something and always reach and understanding
[12/03/2008 08:50:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes of course
[12/03/2008 08:51:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can you think of anything that was wrong with it?  that couldn't be fixed with a simple conversation?
[12/03/2008 08:51:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i say in a way, because we've been long distance throughout the whole relationship
[12/03/2008 08:51:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[12/03/2008 08:51:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: well there was i time i had doubts nearer to the beginning of school
[12/03/2008 08:51:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but every time we were together, everything just clicked back in to place right?
[12/03/2008 08:52:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: when i was most needy and you uh i dont remember, but there was something
[12/03/2008 08:52:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: everything clicked yes
[12/03/2008 08:52:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i didn't know how to comfort you? but that got better right?
[12/03/2008 08:56:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: it had a lot to do with me learning how to comfort myself more, but you get more flexible and understand, so yes. Yes, if you came to realize that if i talked about whatever, instead of the personal issue at hand (not a problem between you and me), I would calm down, be comforted, and feel better, and then maybe i would get around to talking about my stupid dilemma, and you would comfort.... 
[12/03/2008 08:57:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: me again (though not immediately) by hypothetically slapping me in the face and shaking me and saying get a grip woman!
[12/03/2008 08:57:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: sharing your logical perspective
[12/03/2008 08:59:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's comforting, but again, i say it isnt immediately comforting, because sometimes you can do it harshly and it hurts my feelings for a little while cuz it makes me feel dumb for being so emotional about whatever and making you think I'm even more and more dramatic
[12/03/2008 08:59:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz i want you to like me.
[12/03/2008 09:00:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well, it was a work in progress, and i do like you, and i try to remind you that i love you every day, even when you get emotional, to be honest i thought it was kind of cute
[12/03/2008 09:00:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[12/03/2008 09:00:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: its a WIP!
[12/03/2008 09:00:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i heard a quote that women were created by God in order to carry the weight of the world on their shoulders
[12/03/2008 09:01:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i thought you were just doing that, and i want to be there for you to help you get through it and comfort you!
[12/03/2008 09:01:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so, the real question is, why make that worse?  how did our relationship go backwards?  we had everything, we had a perfect understand of each other needs, and we are so reasonable with each other that we could work anything out.  so why screw that up?  i don't mean you screwed it up, we both played a part.  Aristotle said men have a higher ability to reason, so how did it go wrong?
[12/03/2008 09:01:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: is there a point to you opening this conversation up?
[12/03/2008 09:01:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh...
[12/03/2008 09:01:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that was the point...
[12/03/2008 09:03:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: it started unintentionally and then it snowballed and i started making little conscious decisions to match the unitentional repercutions....
[12/03/2008 09:04:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i screwed it up because
[12/03/2008 09:04:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because why?
[12/03/2008 09:06:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: my personality lives for chaos, works to sabotage, yearns for perfection
[12/03/2008 09:06:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's so ingrained, i cant help it
[12/03/2008 09:06:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i need to fix it if i am ever gonna wanna be with someone for the rest of my life
[12/03/2008 09:07:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i agree
[12/03/2008 09:09:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now that i understand that, what can i do to help you? isn't it just like me helping you calm down when you are upset?  is there something i can do to convince you not to screw this up?  we had everything going for us, we were always on the same page, even when you said we were "out of sync" we both felt that way, making us still in sync.
[12/03/2008 09:14:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[12/03/2008 09:14:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: take me out to ice cream spontaneiously
[12/03/2008 09:15:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: ask me questions about me/my past spontaneously (think "what was your favorite board game growing up?")
[12/03/2008 09:15:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: or that could be my job
[12/03/2008 09:16:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: but for reals...
[12/03/2008 09:17:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[12/03/2008 09:17:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah?
[12/03/2008 09:18:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: as i think of my answer... on a side note, i thought being single and learning to like myself and be independent would help me be better at being in a relationship, but that might be too drastic
[12/03/2008 09:18:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: my answer...
[12/03/2008 09:19:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: you could..
[12/03/2008 09:22:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah?
[12/03/2008 09:23:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: first i thought you could remind me of a happy time when you did something special that i liked or even something regular that we both smiled about to remind me how great you are, but that would probably make me sad that I dont have that happiness at the moment you would be reminding me. It seems like a preventative measure rather than a fixing tool, which i think is wha tyou are looking for, but 
[12/03/2008 09:23:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think thats what you and i are looking for in the answer to what you can do to prevent me from sabotaging
[12/03/2008 09:24:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: what you can do...
[12/03/2008 09:24:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am catching on, keep going
[12/03/2008 09:24:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont try to tickly me.
[12/03/2008 09:24:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really?
[12/03/2008 09:24:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i thought it used to be fun
[12/03/2008 09:25:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: it takes great skill to tickle me without annoying me
[12/03/2008 09:25:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you think that maybe your feeling toward me at the time had something to do with it annoying you?
[12/03/2008 09:25:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you really ticklish or not at all ticklish.
[12/03/2008 09:26:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes it does have much to do with that actually
[12/03/2008 09:26:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i guess that isn't really a good answer
[12/03/2008 09:26:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought one of us was one way and the other was the opposite
[12/03/2008 09:26:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: but please dont do it anyway
[12/03/2008 09:26:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: because in fact it can make something slight get worse
[12/03/2008 09:27:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i won't
[12/03/2008 09:27:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you ticklish or not?
[12/03/2008 09:27:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are the ticklish one right?!
[12/03/2008 09:28:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i seem to remember that you would try to tickle me and it wouldnt work
[12/03/2008 09:28:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was
[12/03/2008 09:28:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i seem to remember that we used to play around
[12/03/2008 09:28:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: so thats why i dont remember it being fun in the past
[12/03/2008 09:28:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[12/03/2008 09:28:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant remember :(((((
[12/03/2008 09:28:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would throw you on the bed and tickle you
[12/03/2008 09:28:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[12/03/2008 09:28:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[12/03/2008 09:28:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it would be fun
[12/03/2008 09:29:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok...
[12/03/2008 09:29:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like it when someone trys to tickle me to cheer me up
[12/03/2008 09:29:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like it when im in a happy playful mood
[12/03/2008 09:30:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: we must initiate an official tickle fight for you to tickle me, it wouldnt hurt to create a facebook event
[12/03/2008 09:31:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: or.. a countdown website (think slap bet on How i met your mother)
[12/03/2008 09:32:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: "can i tickle you" "yes".. *tickles* "nooooo" is okay cuz i said yes
[12/03/2008 09:32:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: unless i say the safe word
[12/03/2008 09:32:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't like rules
[12/03/2008 09:32:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe we should just not touch each other
[12/03/2008 09:32:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have better things to do.
[12/03/2008 09:36:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then talk to me?
[12/03/2008 09:37:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, yes. i got hurt at what you said.
[12/03/2008 09:37:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: it reminds me of when i ask you to say something, you dont want to say it simply because i asked you.
[12/03/2008 09:37:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i believe i stopped doing that, right?
[12/03/2008 09:37:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: rules
[12/03/2008 09:37:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got hurt when you didn't consider all the fun times we had when it came to touching each other
[12/03/2008 09:38:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i didnt say something as harsh as we should just not touch
[12/03/2008 09:38:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i forgot you dont like rules, and i wish you could change that, but i suppose you cant, so ill just have to stop making them
[12/03/2008 09:38:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i asked you why our relationship got worse, in a very serious way, and the best thing you can come up with is because i tickle you
[12/03/2008 09:39:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: HEY
[12/03/2008 09:40:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: this is a working conversation, we got sidetracked into the tickle thing when i was trying to answer your main question, the tickle thing is still important to me, this is me telling you it's more troublesome than you think
[12/03/2008 09:40:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: AH i hate wires by my feet!@!!!!#!@#
[12/03/2008 09:41:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow, i really am sounding like a whiny bitch
[12/03/2008 09:42:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it is because i have been trying to "fix" things
[12/03/2008 09:42:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't want to be that person
[12/03/2008 09:42:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dont sound whiny at all honey
[12/03/2008 09:43:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, i am, i am getting upset because you don't want me to tickle you, i sound ridiculous
[12/03/2008 09:43:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really jumped the gun on accepting your relationship status change
[12/03/2008 09:43:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: and today when i was talking about people i dont get along with, i mentioned whiny, but i dont think thats true because i cant think of any instances, i musta said it because thats what a usual person might say
[12/03/2008 09:44:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: you getting upset means that you car a lot about how things are
[12/03/2008 09:44:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: care
[12/03/2008 09:44:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not sure what you mean by "that" person, there doesnt seem to be anything wrong with trying to fix stuff
[12/03/2008 09:45:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we are not making progress right now, i am not cut out for this
[12/03/2008 09:45:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: we arent??????????
[12/03/2008 09:46:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dont think im funny at all
[12/03/2008 09:47:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: :(
[12/03/2008 09:47:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was trying to be funny.
[12/03/2008 09:47:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: silly with you.
[12/03/2008 09:49:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: when you said "i would throw you on the bed and tickle you" it really sparked the attention of my heart. A longing to be with you just for a moment so we can do that.
[12/03/2008 09:49:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: whenever i get upset you want to make everything better, and whenever i try to make things better, you are cold to me
[12/03/2008 09:50:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't....
[12/03/2008 09:50:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont understand
[12/03/2008 09:50:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: "whenever i try to make things better, you are cold to me" are you talking about thanksgiving for example?
[12/03/2008 09:50:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: you cant what?
[12/03/2008 09:51:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do this anymore
[12/03/2008 09:51:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: it confuses me that you think that
[12/03/2008 09:51:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: do what.
[12/03/2008 09:51:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am talking about all the conversations we have had since thinksgiving
[12/03/2008 09:51:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this relationship
[12/03/2008 09:51:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: i am not being cold
[12/03/2008 09:51:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are taking it the wrong way
[12/03/2008 09:52:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: where is this coming from
[12/03/2008 09:52:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the tickling thing is a big deal to me too
[12/03/2008 09:52:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: cold???
[12/03/2008 09:55:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: tell me your perspectives on the tickle thing.
[12/03/2008 09:55:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like i was cold once in this coinverstaion, when i said "i have better things to do"
[12/03/2008 09:56:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't like having boundaries on physical contact because i always like having your hands on me.  so when you say things like i am not allowed to tickle you, it is like saying you don't want me to touch you, you don't want to fool around
[12/03/2008 09:59:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like when i say i dont want to be touched by you and i dont want to fool around, it should be respected, and you shouldn't take it personally because thats just what i feel at the time, but if you push it i put up more boundaries
[12/03/2008 09:59:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do like having boundaries.
[12/03/2008 09:59:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i feel like that isn't something i can deal with
[12/03/2008 10:00:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wish i could put my hands on you
[12/03/2008 10:01:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you are saying, me wanting physical boundaries is something you can't deal with?
[12/03/2008 10:02:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: of course i respect your body and you, but one thing i love about being in that loving relationship is there aren't boundaries.  obviously i wouldn't grab your ass excessively in public, but it doesn't make sense for you to flip out about me putting my hand in your back pocket and doing it spontaneously.  to me, the tickling thing is the same way, it is fun and spontaneous. and when you put up concrete boundaries like that it ruins that feeling of being able to touch and not worrying about whether or not they will like it
[12/03/2008 10:02:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like it slowly
[12/03/2008 10:03:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are times when my skin feels sensitive and it doesn't feel good when you are caressing it, but i would never even consider telling you that you shouldn't do it anymore.
[12/03/2008 10:05:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it hurts especially much when you say things like "i can't remember it every being fun"
[12/03/2008 10:05:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want you to sit next to me and look into my eyes and put your hand on my knee and put my hand on your hand so i can move your hand up my inner thigh the way i want it. i want you to take my head back and kiss my neck, i want to put my other hand on the back of your neck, grabbing your hair. i want to pull your head to my lips, but linger without kissing just for a few seconds. Then you kiss me
[12/03/2008 10:05:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it makes me wonder what you were really thinking when you were giggling when i tickled you, did you really just hate it?  did you want me to get off of you?
[12/03/2008 10:06:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and that self doubt in my ability to make you happy makes me not want to touch you, or be with you
[12/03/2008 10:06:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: if i dont like you at the time i dont want you to tickle me or touch me in certain ways, because i dont like you at the time. 

[12/03/2008 10:07:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not barring physical contact at all times
[12/03/2008 10:08:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: boundaries aren't good for me, i want everything to be as open as my heart for you.
[12/03/2008 10:08:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was just saying that i have a bad memory, i believe that it was fun, but its hard for me to remember
[12/03/2008 10:08:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and that hurts too.
[12/03/2008 10:08:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: "if i don't like you at the time", that sounds ridiculous.
[12/03/2008 10:09:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: people get disappointed, it makes sense they wouldnt want to be touched. and there is no perfect relationship where no one ever gets disappointed in the other.
[12/03/2008 10:10:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: then you kiss me!
[12/03/2008 10:10:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there has never been a time when i didn't like you, there may have been a time when the way you touched me felt weird, but it always went away quickly.
[12/03/2008 10:11:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: brian,
[12/03/2008 10:11:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: im a girl, you've seen movies, girls get upset at boys
[12/03/2008 10:11:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm not you
[12/03/2008 10:11:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: i don't work the same way you do
[12/03/2008 10:12:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's great that you always like me
[12/03/2008 10:12:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so your love for me IS conditional?
[12/03/2008 10:12:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: but its not realistic to think that you will always like me in the future
[12/03/2008 10:12:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well, not any more
[12/03/2008 10:13:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: I love you all the time.
[12/03/2008 10:13:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 4 weeks ago, i thought i would be in love with you forever
[12/03/2008 10:13:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i even told Steve, "she might be the one, i am hopeful"
[12/03/2008 10:13:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now, i don't want to be in this relationship anymore
[12/03/2008 10:14:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay now you are being ridiculous
[12/03/2008 10:17:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't want to feel like this anymore
[12/03/2008 10:17:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: always trying to say the right things and just feeling like i make it worse
[12/03/2008 10:19:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: right now, i might say that if this whole perdicament is enough for you to break up with me, we'd never survive, you cant handle the downs of the relationship that i come along with, you need a better girl who will always let you do what you want and like you no matter what you say, but i dont want to say that, but i just did.
[12/03/2008 10:19:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: stop feeling that way.
[12/03/2008 10:20:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this isn't a down in the relationship, and you can't see that
[12/03/2008 10:20:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[12/03/2008 10:20:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are serious underlying problems here that neither of us seem to be able to deal with
[12/03/2008 10:21:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you make it sound like i am the one that is backing out, and that is not true
[12/03/2008 10:21:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: I guess I thought you were someone else then.
[12/03/2008 10:21:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have tried to be accepting of your change in feelings, i've tried to accept you going on this religious quest
[12/03/2008 10:21:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can deal!
[12/03/2008 10:22:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i
[12/03/2008 10:22:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm feeling more the way i used to
[12/03/2008 10:22:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this is not just some small problem, almost every other thing you say hurts my feelings. what does that mean "i guess i thought you were someone else then"
[12/03/2008 10:22:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm becoming more comfortable with my religious practices
[12/03/2008 10:22:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean who the hell says that
[12/03/2008 10:22:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you are trying to work this out you are not doing a very good job
[12/03/2008 10:23:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: someone who feels like she is seconds away from being broken up with, like i give up, fine
[12/03/2008 10:23:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: I was trying to work this out
[12/03/2008 10:23:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are dismissing what i say
[12/03/2008 10:23:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you spent the last 7 months (happy anniversary by the way) getting to know me, and all of a sudden i am not the person you thought i was?
[12/03/2008 10:24:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: I dont think you are correct in saying every other thing i say hurts your feelings
[12/03/2008 10:24:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, i exaggerated a little, but there has been a few things that really hurt, and you don't seem to care
[12/03/2008 10:25:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont intend any damage, and the only things i say that i think you should be hurt by is a few times when i feel intense pain about what you just said
[12/03/2008 10:25:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am glad that you are comfortable with your religious practices
[12/03/2008 10:25:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: thank you
[12/03/2008 10:26:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it just seems like i am here pouring my heart out to you, and you aren't doing the same to me, you are supposed to me the emotional one
[12/03/2008 10:27:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think you are correct in saying i am not pouring my heart out to you.
[12/03/2008 10:27:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't seem to have the same emotional attachment to me, and that's why we can't find a middle ground
[12/03/2008 10:28:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do have the same emotional attachment, i didnt around thanksgiving, but I do now and i generally do and I DO NOW!
[12/03/2008 10:29:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[12/03/2008 10:29:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my stuff is breaking
[12/03/2008 10:29:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my headphones are broken
[12/03/2008 10:29:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and they are like $350 dollars
[12/03/2008 10:29:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and my monitor is broken
[12/03/2008 10:29:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg!
[12/03/2008 10:29:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i don't think i can get any of them replaced
[12/03/2008 10:30:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and people said my place was boring
[12/03/2008 10:30:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: your place isnt boring
[12/03/2008 10:30:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will try to use restraint when tickling you, i promise to only do it when it really feels right and fun
[12/03/2008 10:30:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: their just temporarily being jerks
[12/03/2008 10:31:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can you admit that sometimes it feels good and you like to be playful?
[12/03/2008 10:31:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: absolutely yes
[12/03/2008 10:31:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: you really hurt me tonight, in a way I never felt before.
[12/03/2008 10:32:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: same here
[12/03/2008 10:33:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: my heart is still reverberating from it, I can barely stand it
[12/03/2008 10:33:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am sorry
[12/03/2008 10:33:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am tired and over reacting
[12/03/2008 10:33:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i feel extra emotional just like you do sometimes
[12/03/2008 10:34:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i feel inadequate, like i can't do anything right with you
[12/03/2008 10:35:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'll accept your apology, but try not to throw out "i cant do this relationship anymore" sortsa words, I felt a thread away from completely losing you, like one more IM and it was over
[12/03/2008 10:35:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i just wish i could get some reassurance, but no matter how hard i try, i don't get it
[12/03/2008 10:36:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont feel that way baby! cuz you arent inadequate, we can talk through things, i can do very many things right for me
[12/03/2008 10:36:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dontknow how to help that you cant see the reassurance i feel like i give you often
[12/03/2008 10:38:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: you can dovery many things
[12/03/2008 10:38:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't want to be without you
[12/03/2008 10:38:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know you are an amazing woman
[12/03/2008 10:38:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: good
[12/03/2008 10:38:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: good
[12/03/2008 10:38:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just with you could think about all the things you like about me and tell me
[12/03/2008 10:38:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: and you are a great guy
[12/03/2008 10:38:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i'd be lost without you
[12/03/2008 10:39:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: you you you!!!!
[12/03/2008 10:40:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wanna scream all the times i do that, but im not gonna, and so i"ll just say that I will try to think of all the things i like about you and tell you from now on
[12/03/2008 10:41:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you want to scream all the times you get emotional?
[12/03/2008 10:41:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think it makes sense to think about if we can't get through something then we would never have lasted
[12/03/2008 10:42:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe we just aren't willing to compromise at the time
[12/03/2008 10:43:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: no. i want right now to say HEY I DO TELL YOU A LOT!
[12/03/2008 10:43:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you're probably right
[12/03/2008 10:43:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think it makes sense either
[12/03/2008 10:43:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats why i didnt officially say it
[12/03/2008 10:43:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think if you said that to me i would want to say the same thing
[12/03/2008 10:43:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[12/03/2008 10:43:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats not completely true
[12/03/2008 10:43:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i would try to tell you how wonderful you are even more

[12/04/2008 12:23:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: outlines suck too

[12/04/2008 12:23:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe just start typing what you already know
[12/04/2008 12:24:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then the rest will form around it
[12/04/2008 12:24:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sleep is nice, but you can look forward to going to bed right after classes tomorrow
[12/04/2008 12:24:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont think i can.. i dont think i can... i think i have to wait til tomorrow, but i still need to do optimization and game theory and they want the paper at midnight :'(

[03/01/2009 03:34:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: what does?
[03/01/2009 03:34:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: two guys a girl and a pizza place?
[03/01/2009 03:34:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we can be friends and i sleep with other girl( s) that would increase the possibility
[03/01/2009 03:34:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[03/01/2009 03:34:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: whatev
[03/01/2009 03:35:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm a little emotionally distraught right now so it probably isn't the best time to talk about that kind of stuff
[03/01/2009 03:36:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: would you be willing to see me over the break?
[03/01/2009 03:36:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to mexico
[03/01/2009 03:37:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: not the whole time
[03/01/2009 03:37:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably the whole time
[03/01/2009 03:37:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dave says the weekends are the best time to be there
[03/01/2009 03:37:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i just had an idea, i could drive you to tucson on my way down if you want to stay with your parents
[03/01/2009 03:38:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i don't know if it would be a good idea for you to come to mexico with me given our current relationship problems
[03/01/2009 03:38:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought you uys were going to pick a weekend
[03/01/2009 03:38:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: not stay for both
[03/01/2009 03:40:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not sure
[03/01/2009 03:47:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know where you would sleep because my brother would be living in the other room
[03/01/2009 03:49:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry
[03/01/2009 03:52:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think this is one of our problems, i get so used to this idea of stuff we can do together, but then you can never make up your mind
[03/01/2009 03:52:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess it is for the best though, i wouldn't be able to stay in this relationship if we weren't going to be in the same city, and you working for raytheon makes that pretty likely
