[08/20/2007 12:13:20 PM] Andrew Olson: nice
[08/20/2007 12:13:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yay for sparse files
[08/20/2007 12:14:22 PM] Andrew Olson: heh
[08/20/2007 12:17:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sharing 4 TB sparse files on dc++

[08/20/2007 12:18:06 PM] Andrew Olson: nice
[08/20/2007 12:18:08 PM] Andrew Olson: hhaha
[08/20/2007 12:18:09 PM] Andrew Olson: why
[08/20/2007 12:18:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking hashing
[08/20/2007 12:18:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: its so stupid
[08/20/2007 12:18:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: why hash 2.5 TB when people only download 100GB per week?
[08/20/2007 12:18:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should hash it on request
[08/20/2007 12:18:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: or after, the same time the client hashes it
[08/20/2007 12:19:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: then keep a cache of the hash, and compare with client
[08/20/2007 12:19:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: not before it adds it to your share size
[08/20/2007 12:19:19 PM] Andrew Olson: meh
[08/20/2007 12:19:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats so gay
[08/20/2007 12:19:28 PM] Andrew Olson: i say fuckit
[08/20/2007 12:19:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: 2.5 TB going through 2GB of memory, thats ridiculous
[08/20/2007 12:19:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: it broke my hard drives
[08/20/2007 12:20:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it read my entire system into memory
[08/20/2007 12:20:06 PM] Andrew Olson: haha
[08/20/2007 12:20:10 PM] Andrew Olson: pwnt
[08/20/2007 12:20:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the harddrive was constantly going
[08/20/2007 12:20:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used 5 years worth of reads, in 1 month
[08/20/2007 12:20:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so now i am sharing sparse files, with NO hard drive reading, just a fuck ton of hashing
[08/20/2007 12:21:04 PM] Andrew Olson: impressive
[08/20/2007 12:21:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: 64kb on disk
