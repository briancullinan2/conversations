[08/31/2008 10:05:46 PM] Joe Flieger: A proton, which is the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, can be modeled as a sphere with a diameter of 2.4 fm and a mass of 1.67 multiplied by 10-27 kg. Determine the density of the proton.
[08/31/2008 10:06:13 PM] Joe Flieger: e-27 on the 1.67
[08/31/2008 10:06:45 PM] Joe Flieger: wow that did come out allmost

[08/31/2008 10:06:52 PM] Joe Flieger:   
How does it compare with the density of lead, which is 11.3 multiplied by 103 kg/m3?
[08/31/2008 10:07:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yup
[08/31/2008 10:07:03 PM] Joe Flieger: Newton's law of universal gravitation is represented by the following equation where F is the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by one small object on another, M and m are the masses of the objects, and r is a distance.  
F = GMm/r2  
Force has the SI units kg·m/s2. What are the SI units of the proportionality constant G?
[08/31/2008 10:07:13 PM] Joe Flieger: Suppose your hair grows at the rate of 1/30 inch per day. Find the rate at which it grows in nanometers per second. Because the distance between atoms in a molecule is on the order of 0.1 nm, your answer suggests how rapidly layers of atoms are assembled in this protein synthesis.
[08/31/2008 10:07:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[08/31/2008 10:07:17 PM] Joe Flieger: thats diffrent?

[08/31/2008 10:07:41 PM] Joe Flieger: A pyramid has a height of 500 ft and its base covers an area of 15.0 acres. The volume of a pyramid is given by the expression V = 1/3 Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. Find the volume of this pyramid in cubic meters. (1 acre = 43 560 ft2).
[08/31/2008 10:07:45 PM] Joe Flieger: thats diffrent same problem though
[08/31/2008 10:07:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now it is different

(d) 0.00548
[08/31/2008 10:08:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and 12 acres

[10/23/2008 05:52:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you know i often stop talking to a person and wait for them to IM me, just to see if they really care.  it usually works out and they IM me a few days later, it is the waiting that is the hard part.  you have to find something else to keep busy instead of thinking about when they will IM you all the time.
[10/23/2008 05:53:25 PM] Joe Flieger: that was the plan

[11/20/2008 11:29:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow that was difficult
[11/20/2008 11:30:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i had to convert a system that read in an entire file into memory, created the checksum and stored to output it all at once, into a file streaming system
[11/20/2008 11:30:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to talk a lot about what i have been doing so you have to read every few seconds

[11/20/2008 11:31:00 AM] Joe Flieger:  im leaving for digs office soon
[11/20/2008 11:31:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i found a function that can add together checksums
[11/20/2008 11:31:07 AM] Joe Flieger:  i can just stop buy
[11/20/2008 11:31:22 AM] Joe Flieger:  only reason i didnt leave yet is teammate is gay and i have to push first
[11/20/2008 11:31:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i converted it to only read in the file once, and it prints it out as it checksums it
[11/20/2008 11:32:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i had to look up the specification in order to find out that you can set certain bits to tell it that the checksum comes after the compressed data! instead of before it
[11/20/2008 11:32:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: zipped files are kind of weird
[11/20/2008 11:32:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is a lot of repeated information

[01/21/2009 09:35:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it says c99 has bool, but i think you have to specify in the compiler options to use that version
[01/21/2009 09:35:11 AM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[01/21/2009 09:35:16 AM] Joe Flieger: or you can define it 
[01/21/2009 09:35:22 AM] Joe Flieger: i just thought it was funny 
[01/21/2009 09:35:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: with an enum yeah
[01/21/2009 09:35:29 AM] Joe Flieger:  im all bool neg = false
[01/21/2009 09:35:38 AM] Joe Flieger:  and then its all wtf is bool
[01/21/2009 09:35:45 AM] Joe Flieger:  wtf bool is bool
[01/21/2009 09:35:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and your all wtf isn't bool
[01/21/2009 09:36:04 AM] Joe Flieger:  it even hilighted it
[01/21/2009 09:36:08 AM] Joe Flieger: i was like lolz 
[01/21/2009 09:36:21 AM] Joe Flieger: fine ill use a whole int 
[01/21/2009 09:36:26 AM] Joe Flieger: you test - 
[01/21/2009 09:36:32 AM] Joe Flieger:  it fuks shit up iono why
[01/21/2009 09:36:45 AM] Joe Flieger:  i think its cuz when u /10 u get like -8
[01/21/2009 09:37:02 AM] Joe Flieger:  and then the nubers are like off by like 03498309483
[01/21/2009 09:37:12 AM] Joe Flieger:  so ur sting is fuked

[01/24/2009 06:14:25 PM] Joe Flieger: thats what you wanted right? 
[01/24/2009 06:14:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah thats perfect
[01/24/2009 06:15:40 PM] Joe Flieger: so i need to figure out how to make it light for 1 sec 
[01/24/2009 06:15:45 PM] Joe Flieger: not 10 
[01/24/2009 06:16:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats what this code does?
[01/24/2009 06:16:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 10 seconds?
[01/24/2009 06:16:15 PM] Joe Flieger: on off on off 
[01/24/2009 06:16:19 PM] Joe Flieger: over n over 
[01/24/2009 06:16:26 PM] Joe Flieger: ^= flips the bit 
[01/24/2009 06:16:36 PM] Joe Flieger: well ^= 1 
[01/24/2009 06:16:47 PM] Joe Flieger: flips the bit 
[01/24/2009 06:18:21 PM] Joe Flieger: im thinking if 40 = 10 then 4=1? 
[01/24/2009 06:20:07 PM] Joe Flieger: cool 
[01/24/2009 06:20:10 PM] Joe Flieger: nm got that 
[01/24/2009 06:20:18 PM] Joe Flieger: um u know how to do this 
[01/24/2009 06:20:32 PM] Joe Flieger: so i want to make a multi dem array 
[01/24/2009 06:20:41 PM] Joe Flieger: of chars 
[01/24/2009 06:20:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[01/24/2009 06:20:54 PM] Joe Flieger: so like * alphas [26] = {a, b 
[01/24/2009 06:21:04 PM] Joe Flieger: char* alphas [26] = {a, b 
[01/24/2009 06:21:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: whats what i was thinking for storing the morriscode data
[01/24/2009 06:21:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but instead
[01/24/2009 06:21:25 PM] Joe Flieger: but i dont want to have all the  
[01/24/2009 06:21:27 PM] Joe Flieger: char* a = ". ..."; 
[01/24/2009 06:21:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[01/24/2009 06:21:33 PM] Joe Flieger: laying around after im done 
[01/24/2009 06:21:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: instead
[01/24/2009 06:21:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: use 0 for short, and 1 for long
[01/24/2009 06:21:53 PM] Joe Flieger: eventualy 
[01/24/2009 06:21:54 PM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[01/24/2009 06:22:02 PM] Joe Flieger: but this was is either to code and understad 
[01/24/2009 06:22:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and just store the binary sequence
[01/24/2009 06:22:08 PM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[01/24/2009 06:22:09 PM] Joe Flieger: i know 
[01/24/2009 06:22:15 PM] Joe Flieger: but this is more readable 
[01/24/2009 06:22:21 PM] Joe Flieger: and now that i got that working 
[01/24/2009 06:22:28 PM] Joe Flieger: i was going to make it better 
[01/24/2009 06:24:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you watch bsg?

[01/24/2009 10:12:10 PM] Joe Flieger: works in sim 
[01/24/2009 10:12:19 PM] Joe Flieger: but then i put it on the chip and it crashes 
[01/24/2009 10:20:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you only have 512 bytes of memory
[01/24/2009 10:20:42 PM] Joe Flieger: ? 
[01/24/2009 10:20:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so your big 2 dimensional array probably won't fit on the chip with the rest of your program
[01/24/2009 10:20:54 PM] Joe Flieger: there consts 
[01/24/2009 10:21:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol yeah but it still loads consts into ram
[01/24/2009 10:21:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you put const = const
[01/24/2009 10:21:40 PM] Joe Flieger: what 
[01/24/2009 10:22:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: define your const <variable name> = const <array>
[01/24/2009 10:22:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just add a const
