[06/05/2007 05:06:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like having the freedom from being with someone
[06/05/2007 05:06:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i agree
[06/05/2007 05:06:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i miss your company occasionally 
[06/05/2007 05:06:33 PM] Christina Sanders: oh occasionally that makes me feel better
[06/05/2007 05:06:34 PM] Christina Sanders: lol

[06/05/2007 05:06:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: ha, well more often then you might think
[06/05/2007 05:06:50 PM] Christina Sanders: and just talking to you and ahnging out with you
[06/05/2007 05:06:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe sometimes is the right word
[06/05/2007 05:07:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really am getting a lot of work done
[06/05/2007 05:07:16 PM] Christina Sanders: i bet
[06/05/2007 05:07:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: and joanna is driving me crazy, and it makes me glad i am not in a relationship
[06/05/2007 05:07:34 PM] Christina Sanders: lol
[06/05/2007 05:07:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: she talks to keifer for hours every day, maybe 1 hour is reasonable like we used to do
[06/05/2007 05:08:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but she fucking locks the door all the time, and sometimes she goes to bed and doesn't unlock i
[06/05/2007 05:08:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: t
[06/05/2007 05:08:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes such an idiot
[06/05/2007 05:08:36 PM] Christina Sanders: well for me i thought i could move on and try to date other whatever, but it's been harder for me than i thought mainly because you were apart of my life for so much and you were my first everything
[06/05/2007 05:08:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: she can't go one week without getting fucked by keifer, she has gone to bullhead every weekend
[06/05/2007 05:08:49 PM] Christina Sanders: oh my good
[06/05/2007 05:08:53 PM] Christina Sanders: *god
[06/05/2007 05:08:54 PM] Christina Sanders: wow
[06/05/2007 05:09:13 PM] Christina Sanders: that's a really long drive
[06/05/2007 05:09:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/05/2007 05:09:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: last weekend he came up here, and because of her addiction to his cock, she didn't bother to ask if he could come, and we already told him we were having guests, so there was no room for him to stay the night
[06/05/2007 05:10:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we made the shithead sleep outside
[06/05/2007 05:10:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: he called dave and asked for directions, didin't even as if he could come in the first place
[06/05/2007 05:10:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: mr. christian is such a hypocrite
[06/05/2007 05:10:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i am done ranting to you
[06/05/2007 05:10:57 PM] Christina Sanders: talking to you right now helps alot and just talking to you as a friend is nice and i'll admit since breaking up alot of stresses have lifted and i am so much better in that sense i just having a tough time moving on
[06/05/2007 05:11:03 PM] Christina Sanders: oh it's okay
[06/05/2007 05:11:06 PM] Christina Sanders: i don't mind at all
[06/05/2007 05:11:10 PM] Christina Sanders: it's nice having you open up
[06/05/2007 05:11:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know, but i rant about them too much, its not healthy or constructive
[06/05/2007 05:11:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: so about this dating
[06/05/2007 05:12:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: my last message to you last time we talked was, even if we do get back together someday, it would still be a good experience for you to date other people
[06/05/2007 05:12:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't want you to wait for something that may never happen
[06/05/2007 05:12:55 PM] Christina Sanders: i miss you but i don't know what i miss
[06/05/2007 05:13:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know what the future hold for our relationship, but i think you should go out and meet other guys and have fun
[06/05/2007 05:13:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: we've established that we miss each others company sometimes
[06/05/2007 05:13:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i'm so scared too
[06/05/2007 05:13:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[06/05/2007 05:13:38 PM] Christina Sanders: i'm just scared of going out and starting over again
[06/05/2007 05:13:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: you will be ok, there are plenty of good guys looking for a meaningful relationship
[06/05/2007 05:13:46 PM] Christina Sanders: and afraid that i'll compare them all to you
[06/05/2007 05:13:58 PM] Christina Sanders: or i'll just think of you when i shouldn't be
[06/05/2007 05:14:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should look forward to starting over, you can take bake all the mistakes we made in our relationship
[06/05/2007 05:14:21 PM] Christina Sanders: i think also i haven't given myself enough time to move on and get over you
[06/05/2007 05:14:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: that may be
[06/05/2007 05:15:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: look from my experience, what i've done in the past sexually hasn't really affected what i do with future girlfriends, and you sometimes think back on those good times in general that you had in previous relationships, but they become just memories, and you make new ones every day with that new significant other
[06/05/2007 05:16:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't let fear hold you back, everything will work out, your parents will let you know if you are making the right choices in finding someone else
[06/05/2007 05:17:04 PM] Christina Sanders: thank you
[06/05/2007 05:17:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you are afraid of losing what we had, don't worry, if someday we date again, there will be new wonderful times we spend together
[06/05/2007 05:17:10 PM] Christina Sanders: i really needed this from you
[06/05/2007 05:17:21 PM] Christina Sanders: it helps alot
[06/05/2007 05:17:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am here for you
[06/05/2007 05:17:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you find someone else you like, you have to let me meet him
[06/05/2007 05:17:51 PM] Christina Sanders: okay
