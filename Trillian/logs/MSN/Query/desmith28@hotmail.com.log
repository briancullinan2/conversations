[04/27/2008 08:15:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like we should talk
[04/27/2008 08:16:55 PM] David Smith: Oh really?
[04/27/2008 08:16:58 PM] David Smith: Bout what?
[04/27/2008 08:17:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure you have heard some things
[04/27/2008 08:17:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i value your friendship
[04/27/2008 08:17:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i hope things that have happened over the last few days doesn't change that
[04/27/2008 08:18:32 PM] David Smith: I honestly have no clue what you're talking about, in what I assume is a good way!
[04/27/2008 08:18:39 PM] David Smith: Did something bad happen?
[04/27/2008 08:18:45 PM] David Smith: If so, it is mostly or entirely not on my radar.
[04/27/2008 08:19:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve broke up with crystal
[04/27/2008 08:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you good friends with steve?
[04/27/2008 08:20:45 PM] David Smith: Oh, yes, I had heard that. I was warned that it was going to happen, and then Crystal told me that it did when I saw her at the movie.
[04/27/2008 08:21:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, when it happened the other night it may have seemed that i had something to do with that.  there are many of us who are sure it was a long time coming, and there are those who blame me as a scapegoat.
[04/27/2008 08:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so my only defense is to assure people that i did not intend to interfere with steve and crystal, and apologize for the loss of his relationship
[04/27/2008 08:24:00 PM] David Smith: Pfft. I see where you are going with this. Naw, it was Crystal's only slightly intoxicated decision. Not like anybody forced her. Lucky you! I don't think anybody screwed up, and if someone did, it was Crystal for doing thigs out of order.
[04/27/2008 08:25:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[04/27/2008 08:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: she did things out of order, but i think her intentions were pure
