[10/20/2008 06:25:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wish i was an integral

[10/20/2008 06:33:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[10/20/2008 06:33:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: an hpc server is not just a server
[10/20/2008 06:33:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is a high performance computing server
[10/20/2008 06:33:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they are much different
[10/20/2008 06:33:41 PM] Elyse Fields: still has the word server in it
[10/20/2008 06:33:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am glad they are teaching you something in that class
[10/20/2008 06:35:24 PM] Elyse Fields: me too 
[10/20/2008 06:38:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should take a real computer class
[10/20/2008 06:39:38 PM] Elyse Fields: i might if i have space for it next semester 
[10/20/2008 06:41:12 PM] Elyse Fields: i plan on having 19 credit hrs
[10/20/2008 06:43:24 PM] Elyse Fields: i say you should go snuggle with joe : ) 
[10/20/2008 06:43:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'd rather snuggle with you
[10/20/2008 06:44:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: joe and i decided that you are going to be our person to slumber with at the slumber party at travis' place in november
[10/20/2008 06:45:56 PM] Elyse Fields: sounds like a snuggly good time. 
[10/20/2008 06:48:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, it should be
[10/20/2008 06:48:57 PM] Elyse Fields: i might not be around though for the scary movie portion
[10/20/2008 06:49:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really?
[10/20/2008 06:49:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will protect you i promise
[10/20/2008 06:50:47 PM] Elyse Fields: i hate scary movies you might get to see me freak out a little 
[10/20/2008 06:50:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yay!
[10/20/2008 06:51:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't like them either
[10/20/2008 06:51:13 PM] Elyse Fields: yay i'm not alone
[10/20/2008 06:51:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: unless i have someone to hold on to, or a shoulder to bury my face in
[10/20/2008 06:53:24 PM] Elyse Fields: we still have to pick a movie feel free to suggest one 
[10/20/2008 06:54:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: quarantine
[10/20/2008 06:55:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you like joe?
[10/20/2008 06:55:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think you are awfully flirtations for not wanting to take anything further
[10/20/2008 06:56:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i've been thinking about your strip tease
[10/20/2008 06:56:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean who you may have chosen
[10/20/2008 06:56:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and out of our circle of friends i can't figure out who you would choose logically
[10/20/2008 06:56:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if i can guess will you tell me if i am right?
[10/20/2008 06:58:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is am upside and a downside to performing such a dance for any one of our friends
[10/20/2008 06:58:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *an
[10/20/2008 06:59:17 PM] Elyse Fields: i try not to be a flirt around him because i don't want to lead him on cus he is really sweet. and if you can guess i'll consider telling you and you should tell me the upside and downside to the dance
[10/20/2008 06:59:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am very glad you asked
[10/20/2008 06:59:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i've thought a lot about this
[10/20/2008 06:59:45 PM] Elyse Fields: really
[10/20/2008 07:00:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so first girls, obviously any girl except for jessica wouldn't really get a lot of pleasure out of such a dance, maybe jessi, but she would probably just be so sarcastic with the whole thing it would be pointless
[10/20/2008 07:01:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is keifer, but he is getting married, on the other hand maybe such a dance would be like a bachelor party type of reminder of all the things he will never get ever again (being with the same woman for the rest of his life and all)
[10/20/2008 07:01:59 PM] Elyse Fields: poor poor keifer
[10/20/2008 07:02:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[10/20/2008 07:02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is travis, he would be a fine pick indeed, however by the time we get into the party, he will be too drunk to realize what is going on/remember/care
[10/20/2008 07:02:37 PM] Elyse Fields: veery true
[10/20/2008 07:02:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is of course joe, but he is already perverted enough, we really shouldn't encourage him
[10/20/2008 07:03:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: have i missed anyone?
[10/20/2008 07:03:54 PM] Elyse Fields: maybe
[10/20/2008 07:04:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i take it the person you chose i haven't listed yet
[10/20/2008 07:04:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well that is a relief, i just wouldn't want a dance performed by such a beautiful girl to be in vein.
[10/20/2008 07:04:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: especially at such an occasion
[10/20/2008 07:05:31 PM] Elyse Fields: you may have guessed wrong : )
[10/20/2008 07:06:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i haven't really guessed anyone
[10/20/2008 07:07:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess there is also me, although i would be the most appreciative of such a gesture, i would in that case still be tragically tied to another woman, but i wouldn't want to discourage you
[10/20/2008 07:07:37 PM] Elyse Fields: of course not 
[10/20/2008 07:10:59 PM] Elyse Fields: then again there will be two lapdances. at least for now i haven't finished the plans yet 
[10/20/2008 07:11:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[10/20/2008 07:11:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right
[10/20/2008 07:11:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well g2g drive home, you should come over later for heros and sarah connor and stuff
[10/20/2008 07:13:08 PM] Elyse Fields: i would but i don't have a way over  jessie is with travis. so i would need a ride
[10/20/2008 07:14:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we will figure it out
[10/20/2008 07:14:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ttyl
[10/20/2008 07:15:11 PM] Elyse Fields: bye

[10/20/2008 08:16:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agreed
[10/20/2008 08:28:47 PM] Elyse Fields: so i just happened to receive a free snowboard and the condition was dave had to be there the first time it was used, joe is going and i'm forcing jessica that means i'm forcing  you to go snowboarding too. : )
[10/20/2008 08:29:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[10/20/2008 08:30:22 PM] Elyse Fields: that was easier then i thought it would be.

[10/23/2008 12:39:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: setting up a DNS server
[10/23/2008 12:40:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: damnit i am still 5th on google
[10/23/2008 12:40:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to find a way to get higher
[10/23/2008 12:42:06 PM] Elyse Fields: i don't really exist on google so i cant help
[10/23/2008 12:44:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how do you spell your first name?
[10/23/2008 12:44:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is it Elyse?
[10/23/2008 12:44:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or Elise?

[10/23/2008 12:45:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[10/23/2008 12:45:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's what i thought
[10/23/2008 12:46:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah google hates you
[10/23/2008 12:46:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should develop your Internet presence 
[10/23/2008 12:47:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am signing up for linked in because the top Brian Cullinan on google has linked in
[10/23/2008 12:49:33 PM] Elyse Fields: what is that, and i like a low profile so lets not devlope my internet presence.  
[10/23/2008 12:50:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you really should
[10/23/2008 12:50:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you are worried about me googling you, just think of what will happen when employers google you
[10/23/2008 12:50:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they should be able to find everything that makes you look awesome
[10/23/2008 12:52:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Awesome, i will be at the top of google in no time
[10/23/2008 12:52:49 PM] Elyse Fields: but then theres the chance they'll find something that makes me look stupid like jessie's drunk video. funny but not something that should be on the internet
[10/23/2008 12:54:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agreed
[10/23/2008 12:54:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: which is why you have to develop your presence
[10/23/2008 12:54:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because it is going to exist whether you like it or not
[10/23/2008 12:55:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if jessie had a website and a linkedin profile, her embarrassing video would be so far down it would be irrelevant, and we wouldn't have been able to find it
[10/23/2008 12:55:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Do you understand what i am trying to get at, when i say Develop?
[10/23/2008 12:55:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is something you have to work on, put a little effort in to, and in the long run it will pay off a lot!
[10/23/2008 12:56:04 PM] Elyse Fields: but i'm lazy 
[10/23/2008 12:56:13 PM] Elyse Fields: :)

[11/13/2008 10:23:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh hai!
[11/13/2008 10:27:00 AM] Elyse Field: i figured this was better than texting 
[11/13/2008 10:27:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agreed
[11/13/2008 10:27:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you didn't get any last night?
[11/13/2008 10:27:32 AM] Elyse Field: nope : )
[11/13/2008 10:27:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: me neither
[11/13/2008 10:27:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even on my birthday
[11/13/2008 10:28:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: :-(
[11/13/2008 10:28:27 AM] Elyse Field: you know i would've but you cant :)
[11/13/2008 10:28:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, sad day
[11/13/2008 10:28:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: steve seems pretty into you though
[11/13/2008 10:30:47 AM] Elyse Field: ya, but i worked some things out  with him last night so it's all good. 
[11/13/2008 10:31:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is it all good?
[11/13/2008 10:31:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: he is sensitive, you sure everything is ok with him?
[11/13/2008 10:32:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: great sex is so hard to find
[11/13/2008 10:33:02 AM] Elyse Field: hells ya it is!!
[11/13/2008 10:34:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: luckily my first time had no strings attached, i did it with the mentality that i didn't really care about seeing this person very often, if you need to be friend with them or if they need something more then just sex it won't work
[11/13/2008 10:35:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what i mean is, you can either not care about the other person and be fuck buddies, or you can be in a relationship with them, there is no in between 
[11/13/2008 10:36:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you said you wanted more then just sex, but you didn't want to be in a very serious relationship, and that will be hard to do
[11/13/2008 10:38:01 AM] Elyse Field: to tell the truth i can live without sex for awhile mostly what i wanted after my breakup was some one to talk to and be a cuddle buddy with you helped alot
[11/13/2008 10:38:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: :-D glad i could help
[11/13/2008 10:39:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and you say you can live without sex because no one has ever given you an orgasm, do you think that it is possible for you to orgasm?
[11/13/2008 10:39:47 AM] Elyse Field: ?? not sure i have only ever had sex with one person
[11/13/2008 10:40:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean if you had an orgasm, you would not be able to "live without sex for a while"
[11/13/2008 10:40:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i already said that
[11/13/2008 10:41:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: most women don't orgasm from sex, you have to do it yourself or the guy has to be good with his hands and tongue
[11/13/2008 10:44:01 AM] Elyse Field: i have to go to class now but could you do me a favor and keep an eye for my lipgloss i think i left it over at your place
[11/13/2008 10:44:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will look for it
[11/13/2008 10:44:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: have a good day!
[11/13/2008 10:44:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: :-)
