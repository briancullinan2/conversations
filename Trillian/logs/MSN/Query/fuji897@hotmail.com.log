[05/19/2007 02:49:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its pretty awesome, they can run a sensor over the pallet and every single individual product has its own identification number
[05/19/2007 02:51:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: eventually it will enable thing such as instant checkout, where all the person has to do is walk under a scanner when leaving a store and instantly all the products they want will be automatically scanned and deducted from their bank account
[05/19/2007 02:51:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because of little radio frequency chips that cost hardly anything
[05/19/2007 02:53:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so give me something to do or pay me

[05/19/2007 04:07:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but seriously mention to the client about adding more features like myspace, a more customizable band page
[05/19/2007 04:07:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like they can select their own color scheme
[05/19/2007 04:07:55 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want a customizable band page
[05/19/2007 04:08:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why?
[05/19/2007 04:08:02 PM] Robert Douglas: myspace is too custom
[05/19/2007 04:08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks ugly
[05/19/2007 04:08:06 PM] Robert Douglas: not professional
[05/19/2007 04:08:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/19/2007 04:08:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i agree
[05/19/2007 04:08:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it should be more customizable
[05/19/2007 04:08:16 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is all about being professiaonal
[05/19/2007 04:08:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we don't even allow for very much profile information
[05/19/2007 04:09:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that when we do the media download area that would be the best time to implement a photo gallery
[05/19/2007 04:11:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the media download will kinda of be like a view all if you will, other sections will be used to display and upload photos, and obviously the player sections, and the media download will be setup to allow download of all content from a band
[05/19/2007 04:11:54 PM] Robert Douglas: alright
[05/19/2007 04:12:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: should work out nicely
[05/19/2007 04:12:11 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to do a similarphoto gallery like we have for ffz, but the ffz one isnt done yet
[05/19/2007 04:12:22 PM] Robert Douglas: tomorrow i should have the final write up done for jambonie
[05/19/2007 04:12:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ffz one is gay
[05/19/2007 04:12:25 PM] Robert Douglas: then i'm gunna talk 2 u

[05/19/2007 04:31:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i like the lightbox script better i think
[05/19/2007 04:31:17 PM] Robert Douglas: unless we can do a pretty sexy implementation of a valid xhtml version of the other galler
[05/19/2007 04:31:21 PM] Robert Douglas: y
[05/19/2007 04:31:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should do that
[05/19/2007 04:31:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and then have it lightbox
[05/19/2007 04:31:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: instead of just get bigger
[05/19/2007 04:31:55 PM] Robert Douglas: no, do the lightbox first
[05/19/2007 04:32:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/19/2007 04:32:01 PM] Robert Douglas: then we'll do something else later
[05/19/2007 04:32:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but have it display the thumbnails like in the gallery
[05/19/2007 04:32:13 PM] Robert Douglas: there are more important things than a gallery better than the lightbox
[05/19/2007 04:32:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no lightbox it good for displaying the images
[05/19/2007 04:32:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that gallery has a hotter thumbnail layout
[05/19/2007 04:32:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going ot make the html pages too for everything we're adding
[05/19/2007 04:32:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/19/2007 04:32:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sounds good
[05/19/2007 04:32:53 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont like the layout
[05/19/2007 04:32:57 PM] Robert Douglas: it has a scroll
[05/19/2007 04:32:58 PM] Robert Douglas: and scrolls suck
[05/19/2007 04:43:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: w/e
[05/19/2007 04:43:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we'll figure it out
[05/19/2007 04:43:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but thats the stuff i should be working on
[05/19/2007 04:43:58 PM] Robert Douglas: omg these drops have a shitty fucking taste
[05/19/2007 04:44:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not fucking paypal bullshit
[05/19/2007 04:44:05 PM] Robert Douglas: ffz needs to be done first
[05/19/2007 04:44:30 PM] Robert Douglas: is it worth $250 for u to integrate PP into FFZ?
[05/19/2007 04:44:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/19/2007 04:44:56 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/19/2007 04:45:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but paypal sucks
[05/19/2007 04:45:10 PM] Robert Douglas: cuz if u rather, i can subtract 250 from what u get paid, and have some1 else do it
[05/19/2007 04:45:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i should be working on intuitive newage stuff
[05/19/2007 04:45:15 PM] Robert Douglas: but imo 250 is pretty good
[05/19/2007 04:45:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fuck
[05/19/2007 04:45:23 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but once u get PP down, it will be super ez
[05/19/2007 04:45:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you know it already?
[05/19/2007 04:45:35 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[05/19/2007 04:45:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i looked at it about a yr ago
[05/19/2007 04:45:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it changed a little
[05/19/2007 04:45:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: damn
[05/19/2007 04:45:54 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty sure u do a lookup based on transaction id
[05/19/2007 04:46:02 PM] Robert Douglas: but check out the new dev forums
[05/19/2007 04:46:06 PM] Robert Douglas: they must have a ton of info
[05/19/2007 04:47:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i keep drinking, but i cant get this shitty taste out of my mouth from the eye drops lol

[05/19/2007 04:53:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm also going to design some jambonie business cards
[05/19/2007 04:58:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you're adding javascript
[05/19/2007 04:58:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't write good javascript
[05/19/2007 04:59:17 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 04:59:20 PM] Robert Douglas: js is simple
[05/19/2007 04:59:26 PM] Robert Douglas: jkuist an alert message

[05/19/2007 05:01:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i wont
[05/19/2007 05:01:57 PM] Robert Douglas: if u rather be working on some jambo stuff right now,that calendar still needs to be completely implemented
[05/19/2007 05:02:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah

[05/19/2007 05:03:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: seriously, just fucking disconnect
[05/19/2007 05:03:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why is there a fucking loading bar when activity is complete
[05/19/2007 05:03:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fucking retarded
[05/19/2007 05:04:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to do svn
[05/19/2007 05:04:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: password for rps account?
[05/19/2007 05:04:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want to get that working again
[05/19/2007 05:05:06 PM] Robert Douglas: no, dont fuck with the rps one
[05/19/2007 05:05:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what?
[05/19/2007 05:05:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude i fucking installed it in the first place
[05/19/2007 05:05:21 PM] Robert Douglas: rps svn is on complete hold
[05/19/2007 05:05:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i should get it working
[05/19/2007 05:05:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wtf?
[05/19/2007 05:05:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: [05/19/2007 05:04:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to do svn
 
[05/19/2007 05:05:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i told u before it wasnt a priority
[05/19/2007 05:05:41 PM] Robert Douglas: svn for jambonie
[05/19/2007 05:05:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: omfg your retarded
[05/19/2007 05:05:52 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 05:05:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just stfu and let me explain
[05/19/2007 05:05:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/19/2007 05:06:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i see you typing
[05/19/2007 05:06:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/19/2007 05:06:07 PM] Robert Douglas: booo
[05/19/2007 05:06:14 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to do something for jambonie to manage check ins/outs
[05/19/2007 05:06:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, subversion can handle very large databases, eventually i will put this into a protocol, but right now i'll just brief you.
[05/19/2007 05:07:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking this one here: (Link: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
[05/19/2007 05:07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah no duh, thats just a client though
[05/19/2007 05:07:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/19/2007 05:07:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the way SVN should be set up is we have 1 svn server running, that runs under the rps account
[05/19/2007 05:07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it won't just be for the rps website
[05/19/2007 05:07:45 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is going to be completely unrelated to rps
[05/19/2007 05:07:54 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to use its'own servers for EVERYTHING
[05/19/2007 05:09:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will be similar to our password database, how we have 1 database but that contains seperate tables for each client, same with SVN we have 1 svn server that contains seperate tables for each project
[05/19/2007 05:09:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now keep stfuing
[05/19/2007 05:09:13 PM] Robert Douglas: k, but u are already wrong
[05/19/2007 05:09:18 PM] Robert Douglas: continue to waste time lol
[05/19/2007 05:09:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no i will explain why i am not wrong
[05/19/2007 05:09:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i fucking told you
[05/19/2007 05:09:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/19/2007 05:09:44 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as svn is installed/connected outside of jambonie, it wont work
[05/19/2007 05:09:46 PM] Robert Douglas: but continue
[05/19/2007 05:09:49 PM] Robert Douglas: imma go get a drink
[05/19/2007 05:11:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: on the actual filesystem it should be stored under a common location similar to the vault, this location will have a seperate folder for each large project, and possibly a common folder for all the company related stuff
[05/19/2007 05:12:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now in the actual svn database the filesystem will be set up exactly the way you are thinking it should be, every project will have its own set of files, our company will have one, jambonie will have one, ffz will have one, all the website versions will be stored in its own location
[05/19/2007 05:13:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: futhermore
[05/19/2007 05:13:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you have a misunderstanding, you said as long as it is installed outside of jambonie it won't work
[05/19/2007 05:13:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stfu
[05/19/2007 05:13:59 PM] Robert Douglas: u need to checkin the hambonie template files
[05/19/2007 05:14:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i checked them all in just override
[05/19/2007 05:14:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant download via FTP
[05/19/2007 05:14:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it says all locked
[05/19/2007 05:14:46 PM] Robert Douglas: close DW
[05/19/2007 05:15:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/19/2007 05:16:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is no reason to store it on the same computer as jambonie, SVN is a backups version system, its not meant to be live at all, you can't use the newest version of a file in the svn as a live content on a website, it is completely detached, it is its own file system, there is no interface for running live content directly out of a subversion
[05/19/2007 05:17:24 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt matter, it is still attcahed to rps
[05/19/2007 05:17:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the way that we can use it is similar to check in and check out but every change is recorded through difference files
[05/19/2007 05:17:45 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as it doesnt go through an RPS server, it's fine
[05/19/2007 05:17:54 PM] Robert Douglas: like i said earlier, but u wanted to go into details and waste ur time
[05/19/2007 05:18:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then you do not understand how it works
[05/19/2007 05:18:07 PM] Robert Douglas: we can do an SVN for RPS projects, but jambonie isn't one we're gunna do
[05/19/2007 05:18:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not my fault that you don't understand
[05/19/2007 05:18:30 PM] Robert Douglas: do it ur way, that's ok, justkeep in mind u cant have it run through an RPS server
[05/19/2007 05:18:31 PM] Robert Douglas: k?
[05/19/2007 05:18:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tortoise svn is a client, there must be a server running somewhere
[05/19/2007 05:18:42 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[05/19/2007 05:18:47 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll install subversion on jambonie
[05/19/2007 05:19:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so where do you want the server if it can't be on a rps server
[05/19/2007 05:19:17 PM] Robert Douglas: tortoise svn is what we're gunna use to connect to the jambonie svn
[05/19/2007 05:19:23 PM] Robert Douglas: it's going to be on the jambonie server
[05/19/2007 05:19:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: k
[05/19/2007 05:21:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and all i am saying is there is no logical reason why we should keep them separate, our company owns the development rights to it, we should keep all projects under development in the same place, when it goes live, thats when it should be put on the dedicated server
[05/19/2007 05:21:30 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is different, other sites can use an RPS SVN, but jambonie isn't
[05/19/2007 05:21:35 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is too big
[05/19/2007 05:21:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way, i have to get a svn server working, with your gay ass file system limitations
[05/19/2007 05:22:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like running apache under nobody user
[05/19/2007 05:22:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: another thing is certain things should never be put in the svn like highly dynamic content like dream weaver meta data, and the uploads folder
[05/19/2007 05:24:24 PM] Robert Douglas: that;s right
[05/19/2007 05:24:37 PM] Robert Douglas: we can control access to certain levels too,right?
[05/19/2007 05:24:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/19/2007 05:24:44 PM] Robert Douglas: because, you and me should have access to all
[05/19/2007 05:24:50 PM] Robert Douglas: but alex should have access to like images folder
[05/19/2007 05:25:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it has the same permissions as the filesystem
[05/19/2007 05:25:07 PM] Robert Douglas: that way alex cant fuck anything up
[05/19/2007 05:25:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol

[05/19/2007 06:42:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but on the html pages it should default to error not errorG
[05/19/2007 06:42:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats the way it is in the code
[05/19/2007 06:42:23 PM] Robert Douglas: implement it any way u want

[05/19/2007 06:45:58 PM] Robert Douglas: to test the loads
[05/19/2007 06:46:53 PM] Robert Douglas: for our jambonie svn
[05/19/2007 06:47:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we'll install apache 2.x on one port
[05/19/2007 06:47:07 PM] Robert Douglas: and then install the svn on that port
[05/19/2007 06:47:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or you could just let me get it working my way fucker
[05/19/2007 06:48:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but now, "don't fuck with that shit"
[05/19/2007 06:48:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: too much other stuff to do
[05/19/2007 06:48:12 PM] Robert Douglas: u dont do anything RPS related right now
[05/19/2007 06:48:20 PM] Robert Douglas: we only care about jambonie anf ffz

[05/19/2007 06:48:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i hit a road block while installing it, i'm going to have to same problem with the jambonie one
[05/19/2007 06:48:53 PM] Robert Douglas: no it isnt, because if u work on the RPS side of things (currently running apache 1.3 as opposed to 2.0),u will be wasting time, because we're going to need to do it for jambonie
[05/19/2007 06:48:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just wanted to fucking figure out how to work around the problem and you shot me down
[05/19/2007 06:48:58 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont care about rps
[05/19/2007 06:49:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so shut the fuck up

[05/19/2007 06:49:17 PM] Robert Douglas: see, ur upset because u wasted ur time explaining ur idea,that i said wasnt going to work
[05/19/2007 06:49:21 PM] Robert Douglas: and ialso said u were wasting time
[05/19/2007 06:49:26 PM] Robert Douglas: by trying to explain it
[05/19/2007 06:49:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no you don't understand how svn SHOULD work
[05/19/2007 06:49:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its your fucking  problem not mine
[05/19/2007 06:49:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yes i do

[05/19/2007 06:50:00 PM] Robert Douglas: u think we have one svn server to handle all client sites
[05/19/2007 06:50:07 PM] Robert Douglas: i agree, that sounds great, but we're not gunna do that for jambonie
[05/19/2007 06:50:14 PM] Robert Douglas: so why waste time trying to do it for rps?
[05/19/2007 06:50:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: which is retarded
[05/19/2007 06:50:25 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is sep. from rps

[05/19/2007 06:50:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because its not even fucking installed on jambonie server douchebag
[05/19/2007 06:50:52 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be installed on jambonie server
[05/19/2007 06:50:56 PM] Robert Douglas: NOT on rps server
[05/19/2007 06:51:05 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to run completely on jambonie
[05/19/2007 06:51:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how is it seperate? are they not a client of rps? who the fuck am i working for?
[05/19/2007 06:51:22 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie is a different story
[05/19/2007 06:51:32 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why i said other clients are fine, but jambo needs to have its' own
[05/19/2007 06:51:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well maybe i shouldn't do any more work until you explain who the fuck i am working for
[05/19/2007 06:51:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because i haven't gotten paid

[05/19/2007 06:52:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now we are all employees of jambonie?
[05/19/2007 06:52:24 PM] Robert Douglas: company owns a % of jambonie now
[05/19/2007 06:52:35 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie.com llc is its' own company now
[05/19/2007 06:52:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude stfu you are making no sense
[05/19/2007 06:52:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it has a legal name
[05/19/2007 06:52:49 PM] Robert Douglas: lol, u just dont understand, so ur getting upset

[05/19/2007 06:54:02 PM] Robert Douglas: with jambo, we might even pull the svn into its' own server later on, as we increase our development
[05/19/2007 06:54:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ridiculous
[05/19/2007 06:54:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: w/e
[05/19/2007 06:54:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll set it up when you want me to
[05/19/2007 06:54:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but its the same fucking problem i might as well solve it while i can
[05/19/2007 06:56:11 PM] Robert Douglas: we're gunna need to install apache 2, and find out all the modules we need for the svn
[05/19/2007 06:56:11 PM] Robert Douglas: the rps box is running apache 1.3
[05/19/2007 06:56:12 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to run both on jambonie
[05/19/2007 06:56:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats retarded
[05/19/2007 06:56:30 PM] Robert Douglas: why?
[05/19/2007 06:56:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: running 2 versions of apache for 1 website
[05/19/2007 06:56:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: listen to yourself
[05/19/2007 06:56:53 PM] Robert Douglas: lol, ur so dumb
[05/19/2007 06:56:55 PM] Robert Douglas: websvn benefits from apache 2.0
[05/19/2007 06:57:05 PM] Robert Douglas: we install the svn on one port
[05/19/2007 06:57:08 PM] Robert Douglas: to benefit from apache 2.0
[05/19/2007 06:57:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we can move the jambonie site to the new version
[05/19/2007 06:57:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its backwards compatible
[05/19/2007 06:57:36 PM] Robert Douglas: the svn will be on apache 2.x because there are certain modules that are better on 2.x
[05/19/2007 06:57:41 PM] Robert Douglas: better=require
[05/19/2007 06:57:46 PM] Robert Douglas: such as webdav
[05/19/2007 06:57:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no shit
[05/19/2007 06:58:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude i have worked with all this stuff before, you are not tell me anything new
[05/19/2007 06:58:09 PM] Robert Douglas: well, u didn't seem to understand why you would run 2 versions
[05/19/2007 06:58:14 PM] Robert Douglas: "b.cullinan@cox.net says: 
running 2 versions of apache for 1 website 
b.cullinan@cox.net says: 
listen to yourself"
[05/19/2007 06:58:17 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 06:58:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should put the jambonie site on apache 2 also
[05/19/2007 06:58:27 PM] Robert Douglas: LOL
[05/19/2007 06:58:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i explained to u already
[05/19/2007 06:58:34 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant do that
[05/19/2007 06:58:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, you can't do that
[05/19/2007 06:58:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can
[05/19/2007 06:58:58 PM] Robert Douglas: no u cant
[05/19/2007 06:59:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if i were running the servers things would be moving a hell of a lot faster
[05/19/2007 06:59:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then fucking waiting for admins to install shit
[05/19/2007 06:59:12 PM] Robert Douglas: if u do that, everytime an update is made on jambonie to the apache config, it will be completely overwritten
[05/19/2007 06:59:20 PM] Robert Douglas: u dont understand how cpanel/whm work
[05/19/2007 06:59:33 PM] Robert Douglas: cpanel is running apache 1.3
[05/19/2007 06:59:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so cpanel doesn't work on 2.0?
[05/19/2007 06:59:44 PM] Robert Douglas: not yet
[05/19/2007 06:59:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fucking damnit
[05/19/2007 06:59:50 PM] Robert Douglas: u can still install apache 1.3
[05/19/2007 07:00:04 PM] Robert Douglas: good thing u r not running the server lmao
[05/19/2007 07:00:13 PM] Robert Douglas: u have NO fucking clue about the setup
[05/19/2007 07:00:20 PM] Robert Douglas: u would have installed apache 2.0
[05/19/2007 07:00:30 PM] Robert Douglas: then found out everytime cpanel is used, it overwrites the config
[05/19/2007 07:00:37 PM] Robert Douglas: and then u will wonder why shit doesnt work
[05/19/2007 07:01:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow
[05/19/2007 07:01:39 PM] Robert Douglas: if u were familiar with cpanel/whm, then i think u might be able to handle it
[05/19/2007 07:01:48 PM] Robert Douglas: but u have no clue about it
[05/19/2007 07:01:52 PM] Robert Douglas: our admins know it inside and out
[05/19/2007 07:01:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't even want to talk to you anymore
[05/19/2007 07:02:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why and i even working for you
[05/19/2007 07:02:07 PM] Robert Douglas: lol, u upset because i made u wrong?
[05/19/2007 07:02:15 PM] Robert Douglas: :'(
[05/19/2007 07:02:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, i am upset because your prejudice
[05/19/2007 07:02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: against?
[05/19/2007 07:02:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you make judgements about me and you have no idea what i can handle
[05/19/2007 07:02:58 PM] Robert Douglas: i know u dont know cpanel/whm
[05/19/2007 07:03:09 PM] Robert Douglas: because we've already talked about it
[05/19/2007 07:03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: "so cpanel doesn't work on 2.0?"
[05/19/2007 07:03:26 PM] Robert Douglas: "if i were running the servers things would be moving a hell of a lot faster"
[05/19/2007 07:03:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no thats completely irrelevent 
[05/19/2007 07:03:30 PM] Robert Douglas: "we should put the jambonie site on apache 2 also"
[05/19/2007 07:03:34 PM] Robert Douglas: see
[05/19/2007 07:03:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no thats completely irrelevent 
[05/19/2007 07:03:45 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant run our servers because u DONT KNOW OUR ENTIRE SETUP
[05/19/2007 07:03:50 PM] Robert Douglas: you are not familiar with cpanel/whm
[05/19/2007 07:04:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just because i don't know how to use cpanel doesn't mean that it would take me any more then a google search to figure out how to use it
[05/19/2007 07:04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i never said you couldn't figure it out
[05/19/2007 07:04:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i just said you DONT KNOW
[05/19/2007 07:04:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats correct i don't know your entire setup but it is pretty dick of you to say that i can't run the servers
[05/19/2007 07:04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: re-read everything i said
[05/19/2007 07:04:53 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant run our shit because u dont know it
[05/19/2007 07:04:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: meaning that i don't have the potential to learn enough about them to run them
[05/19/2007 07:05:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i never said u dont have potential
[05/19/2007 07:05:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah you're an asshole
[05/19/2007 07:05:07 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 07:05:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: [05/19/2007 07:04:53 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant run our shit
[05/19/2007 07:05:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fuck you
[05/19/2007 07:05:18 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant
[05/19/2007 07:05:21 PM] Robert Douglas: u dont know cpanel/whm
[05/19/2007 07:05:22 PM] Robert Douglas: srry
[05/19/2007 07:05:28 PM] Robert Douglas: learn that then you might be able to
[05/19/2007 07:05:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i can learn, i've never looked into it
[05/19/2007 07:05:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, right now u CANT
[05/19/2007 07:05:44 PM] Robert Douglas: u dont know cpanel
[05/19/2007 07:05:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i never said u couldnt learn
[05/19/2007 07:06:04 PM] Robert Douglas: but i know for sure u wont learn on our live sites
[05/19/2007 07:06:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: k w/e, i'm not going to argue

[05/19/2007 07:06:21 PM] Robert Douglas: i would NEVER trust someone to run our server that is just learning
[05/19/2007 07:06:27 PM] Robert Douglas: u gotta get a test box, run it for awhile, get used to everything
[05/19/2007 07:06:32 PM] Robert Douglas: THEN you can talk about running shit
[05/19/2007 07:06:45 PM] Robert Douglas: but u will never be our guy to run shit, we need someone onsite to manage everything
[05/19/2007 07:07:11 PM] Robert Douglas: but maybe in the future we can talk about leading the server management team, but i think ur much better with programming projects, since we already have an incredible admin team
[05/19/2007 07:07:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude i know more about running a linux server then you, but you won't even give me the fucking password to the rps account to finish setting up svn, so that i know how to set it up on jambonie when the time comes
[05/19/2007 07:07:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i am not going to do anymore work until i get the respect i deserver
[05/19/2007 07:07:32 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, u know a lotmore about linux and servers in general
[05/19/2007 07:07:38 PM] Robert Douglas: but you dont know about our setup
[05/19/2007 07:07:53 PM] Robert Douglas: i know u would be much better managing a personal server than me
[05/19/2007 07:07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: but when u work with cpanel and whm
[05/19/2007 07:08:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it is an entirely different game
[05/19/2007 07:08:14 PM] Robert Douglas: because some shit doesnt work with that combo
[05/19/2007 07:08:16 PM] Robert Douglas: and our admins know that
[05/19/2007 07:08:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude how many times do i have to tell you, thats completely irrelevant, the only reason i don't know cpanel is because i haven't needed to manage it yet, if you give me that responsibility, then i will learn it
[05/19/2007 07:09:09 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant learn it on a live site
[05/19/2007 07:09:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: simple as that
[05/19/2007 07:09:13 PM] Robert Douglas: that's unacceptable
[05/19/2007 07:09:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't need to learn it on a live site
[05/19/2007 07:09:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: where did that even come from?

[05/19/2007 07:10:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this fucking conversation
[05/19/2007 07:10:35 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 07:10:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm not stopping u
[05/19/2007 07:10:46 PM] Robert Douglas: u r more than free to go try to learn cpanel
[05/19/2007 07:11:02 PM] Robert Douglas: but even when u learn it, we're still going ot be paying for an admin service
[05/19/2007 07:11:08 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay for 24/7 onsite admin
[05/19/2007 07:11:16 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay for 24/7 monitoring service
[05/19/2007 07:11:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if sites go down, admins and CEO is page
[05/19/2007 07:11:24 PM] Robert Douglas: d
[05/19/2007 07:11:35 PM] Robert Douglas: we are notified about datacenter maintenance
[05/19/2007 07:11:39 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay for upgraded hardware
[05/19/2007 07:11:47 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay for extra onsite hardware in case of failure
[05/19/2007 07:11:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so right now there is no reason for me to learn it
[05/19/2007 07:11:53 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay for rvskins, rvsitebuilder, fantastico
[05/19/2007 07:12:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that doesn't change the fact that you refuse to give me a password to the fucking rps account
[05/19/2007 07:12:18 PM] Robert Douglas: we pay to have multiple admins and support
[05/19/2007 07:12:39 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm more than happy to give u access to it if u need it, but u dont need it
[05/19/2007 07:12:47 PM] Robert Douglas: and the svn stuff i told u we're not gunna worry about with RPS
[05/19/2007 07:13:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so tell me why u need it, and i'll go find the new pw
[05/19/2007 07:13:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i told you that i need to figure out HOW to get it working, so then when jambonie is ready and installed it won't take me any time at all to configure there
[05/19/2007 07:14:03 PM] Robert Douglas: there is other stuff to work on than the rps svn
[05/19/2007 07:14:15 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to start the svn with jambonie
[05/19/2007 07:14:17 PM] Robert Douglas: not with rps
[05/19/2007 07:14:34 PM] Robert Douglas: but we're going to need to put it on apache 2.0
[05/19/2007 07:14:38 PM] Robert Douglas: and figure out a port to use for it
[05/19/2007 07:14:46 PM] Robert Douglas: and then figure out what modules we're going to use for the jambo svn
[05/19/2007 07:14:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i already know all that
[05/19/2007 07:15:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats not my problem
[05/19/2007 07:15:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my problem is permissions and its still going to exist
[05/19/2007 07:15:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you can go ahead and get your admins to set it up for you
[05/19/2007 07:15:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm not going to worry about it anymore
[05/19/2007 07:16:01 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 07:16:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if u have a reason to have access to full rps server root,i'll give it 2 u
[05/19/2007 07:16:30 PM] Robert Douglas: but until then, access is limited
[05/19/2007 07:16:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just want access to the rps account
[05/19/2007 07:16:58 PM] Robert Douglas: but if i give u that, ur gunna waste time with shit that isnt needed
[05/19/2007 07:17:09 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie calendar stuff isnt done
[05/19/2007 07:17:16 PM] Robert Douglas: what about the jambonie top video/song?
[05/19/2007 07:17:25 PM] Robert Douglas: currently it only does the top media where the song is at
[05/19/2007 07:17:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to grab the top mp3
[05/19/2007 07:17:36 PM] Robert Douglas: and then the top video flv
[05/19/2007 07:17:55 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not going to do jack shit with the jambo svn until we talk about a complete implemntation
[05/19/2007 07:17:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i think i am done for the night

[05/19/2007 07:18:30 PM] Robert Douglas: we need PP shit done to get check from FFZ
[05/19/2007 07:18:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i'm not going to work on it anymore
[05/19/2007 07:18:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: shit i haven't even been paid for the work i have done
[05/19/2007 07:19:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah i know,it's gay
[05/19/2007 07:19:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i yelled at the client
[05/19/2007 07:19:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: haven't been paid for radiology either
[05/19/2007 07:19:25 PM] Robert Douglas: radiology client went on vacation
[05/19/2007 07:19:31 PM] Robert Douglas: everything on ur part is done though
[05/19/2007 07:19:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so they closed their bank account and canceled their checkcard
[05/19/2007 07:20:11 PM] Robert Douglas: ffz is gunna bring in another 200-500 once they send their final check
[05/19/2007 07:20:24 PM] Robert Douglas: no, they just are not near a computer
[05/19/2007 07:20:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i called radiology already
[05/19/2007 07:20:34 PM] Robert Douglas: and she called back
[05/19/2007 07:20:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and was like i'll be at a compuer in another couple days to check it all out
[05/19/2007 07:20:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that needs to change
[05/19/2007 07:21:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: from now on we need to get their billing information at the same time the contract is signed
[05/19/2007 07:21:36 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to get a lawyer to review our basic contract, and we're going to add a clause that says if work is done on time, client needs to pay us on time, even if they dont get a chance to review everything
[05/19/2007 07:21:38 PM] Robert Douglas: something like that
[05/19/2007 07:22:12 PM] Robert Douglas: because if our shit is done, we shouldnt have to wait 2 weeks to get paid
[05/19/2007 07:22:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm gunna call jambo guy again
[05/19/2007 07:22:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there should be either 0 or 1 meeting after the finalization date, and the next day the account should be billied
[05/19/2007 07:22:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (billed
[05/19/2007 07:22:39 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant because we accept checks
[05/19/2007 07:22:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why not bill and send an invoice?
[05/19/2007 07:23:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: other companies do it
[05/19/2007 07:23:23 PM] Robert Douglas: some clients pay with checks
[05/19/2007 07:23:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like when you sign up for a service that bills you once per month
[05/19/2007 07:23:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should stop taking personal checks
[05/19/2007 07:24:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the website should only exist of a dev account until the check has been processed
[05/19/2007 07:24:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fuck something to protect ourselves this is outrageous
[05/19/2007 07:24:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: jambonie should even be found at jambonie.com, it should say coming soon until we get fucking paid
[05/19/2007 07:24:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need a lawyer
[05/19/2007 07:26:09 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 07:26:18 PM] Robert Douglas: jambo is a long term client
[05/19/2007 07:26:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i just called them again
[05/19/2007 07:26:24 PM] Robert Douglas: and complained some more for u
[05/19/2007 07:26:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah but these other two
[05/19/2007 07:26:36 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, FFZ is bullshit
[05/19/2007 07:26:47 PM] Robert Douglas: i couldnt believe when they turned this shit around
[05/19/2007 07:26:50 PM] Robert Douglas: omg they changed their shit up so bad
[05/19/2007 07:27:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats retarded
[05/19/2007 07:27:18 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/19/2007 07:27:24 PM] Robert Douglas: plus the client doesnt know how to use a fuckign omputer
[05/19/2007 07:27:29 PM] Robert Douglas: it makes it 1000000 times harder to get shit done
[05/19/2007 07:28:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need a lawyer
[05/19/2007 07:28:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have many family members that are lawyers
[05/19/2007 07:29:08 PM] Robert Douglas: once we get some more funding in, we're going to have a contract lawyer read our contract over
[05/19/2007 07:29:20 PM] Robert Douglas: call them, and find out if any are business contract lawyers
[05/19/2007 07:29:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: kinda tired of getting fucked on payment dates
[05/19/2007 07:29:41 PM] Robert Douglas: btw brian, if alex/I didnt think u had potential, wewouldn't be talking to u right now
[05/19/2007 07:29:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i figured
[05/19/2007 07:29:54 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, well u did fuckup with FFZ by not getting shit done that last weekend
[05/19/2007 07:30:04 PM] Robert Douglas: because i really expected it all to be up and running
[05/19/2007 07:30:12 PM] Robert Douglas: and even today, it still isnt finished completely, because we need the PP shit done
[05/19/2007 07:30:26 PM] Robert Douglas: but it is at the point now where FFZ can actually use the site and such
[05/19/2007 07:30:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i still think we should set up the svn asap to start using it with the projects we are working on now
[05/19/2007 07:30:53 PM] Robert Douglas: the only project that really needs svn is the RPS site, and Jambo
[05/19/2007 07:31:05 PM] Robert Douglas: but RPS site isnt a priority right  now
[05/19/2007 07:31:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: every website should use it
[05/19/2007 07:31:18 PM] Robert Douglas: jambo is, but we still need to sit down and discuss everything with jambo to make sure we outline the svn correctly
[05/19/2007 07:31:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its a version control system
[05/19/2007 07:31:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it can be used for backing stuff up
[05/19/2007 07:31:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what it my hard drive crashed
[05/19/2007 07:32:05 PM] Robert Douglas: we have weekly backups, monthly backups, and daily backups that are 2 days old
[05/19/2007 07:32:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: everything related to the entire company would be gone, and there would be no system other then everyone elses random versions to restore it
[05/19/2007 07:32:58 PM] Robert Douglas: nah, our backup schedule is awesome
[05/19/2007 07:33:05 PM] Robert Douglas: it doest a complete site backup too
[05/19/2007 07:33:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we don't need svn at all?
[05/19/2007 07:34:27 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll use svn instead of dreamweaver
[05/19/2007 07:34:33 PM] Robert Douglas: so no more checkin/out
[05/19/2007 07:34:45 PM] Robert Douglas: also, u and me are going to switch to a different programmming program instead of dreamweaver
[05/19/2007 07:34:51 PM] Robert Douglas: since we both only work in code view
[05/19/2007 07:35:02 PM] Robert Douglas: there is this program that actually tells u of syntax errors before u even hit save
[05/19/2007 07:35:08 PM] Robert Douglas: and it also remembers certain functions and shit
[05/19/2007 07:35:23 PM] Robert Douglas: it creates its' own api doc so to say
[05/19/2007 07:35:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: eclipse handles svn nicely, but the ftp sucks ass
[05/19/2007 07:35:41 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to hook it into svn
[05/19/2007 07:35:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i was talking to this other programmer and he uses it
[05/19/2007 07:35:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we should do that now
[05/19/2007 07:35:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i just forget wtf it was called

[05/19/2007 07:43:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: alex agrees we should set up svn now for managing documents
[05/19/2007 07:43:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and put the password in opm
[05/19/2007 07:43:56 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[05/19/2007 07:43:58 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 07:44:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we have that software for a reason
[05/19/2007 07:44:02 PM] Robert Douglas: we already discussed this shit
[05/19/2007 07:44:08 PM] Robert Douglas: ur not going to waste time on rps svn right now
[05/19/2007 07:44:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how is it a waste of time?
[05/19/2007 07:44:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can use it now
[05/19/2007 07:44:25 PM] Robert Douglas: u have more important shit to do
[05/19/2007 07:44:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for managing current websites
[05/19/2007 07:44:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, i'll prioritize the way i want to
[05/19/2007 07:44:49 PM] Robert Douglas: we have an RPS meeting monday
[05/19/2007 07:44:55 PM] Robert Douglas: we can discuss changing something like this then
[05/19/2007 07:45:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the only reason ffz isn't done is because we didn't go over error checking at all last week
[05/19/2007 07:45:04 PM] Robert Douglas: monday will be a good time to bring it up
[05/19/2007 07:45:17 PM] Robert Douglas: ffz isnt done because u didnt have internet access last weekend
[05/19/2007 07:46:01 PM] Robert Douglas: make a note to bring up SVN on monday's meeting
[05/19/2007 07:46:15 PM] Robert Douglas: outline the benefits for RPS now, and why we need it
[05/19/2007 07:46:37 PM] Robert Douglas: then all 3 of us will go over it, and vote on if it is something we need or not
[05/19/2007 07:47:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude theres nothing to fucking vote on
[05/19/2007 07:47:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yes there is
[05/19/2007 07:47:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm saying we should use it, alex agrees, thats the way it is
[05/19/2007 07:47:33 PM] Robert Douglas: because mondaywe're discussing sugar
[05/19/2007 07:47:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you're just being a control freak
[05/19/2007 07:48:04 PM] Robert Douglas: we might have sugar handle it all under the RPS Protocol
[05/19/2007 07:48:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not going to try and reason with you
[05/19/2007 07:48:14 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/19/2007 07:48:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: alex and i have looked into the sugar document handler
[05/19/2007 07:48:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not nearly as extensive, and it doesn't keep different versions
[05/19/2007 07:49:20 PM] Robert Douglas: well bring up reasons why sugar wont work for what we need on monday's meeting
[05/19/2007 07:49:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm not as familiar with sugar as alex is, so it might not work for us, we'll see
[05/19/2007 07:49:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats just wasting time, i could have it working by then
[05/19/2007 07:49:57 PM] Robert Douglas: but we might decide it isnt something we do
[05/19/2007 07:50:01 PM] Robert Douglas: no reason to jump the gun
[05/19/2007 07:50:05 PM] Robert Douglas: before we know it is what we need
[05/19/2007 07:50:10 PM] Robert Douglas: especially if there is other shit 2 do
[05/19/2007 07:50:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if u didnt have stuff to do,i'd say go ahead and just fuck around with it if u wany

[05/19/2007 09:21:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it kept fucking up on me, repeated keys, some keys didn't register, replaced batteries, the whole bit, couldn't play video games, go to the point where i had to press ctrl+c for copy twice in order to get it to work, drove me nuts, so i gave up and switched back to my microsoft one and everything works flawlessly, not to mention all the time i spent in forums and google trying to figure out what was wrong, turns out tons of people have the same problem, even worse problems with their shitty ass drivers
[05/19/2007 09:21:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *middle fingure*
[05/19/2007 09:21:53 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/19/2007 09:22:05 PM] Robert Douglas: ur problem is that the keyboard will buildup extra power inside the keys
[05/19/2007 09:22:09 PM] Robert Douglas: and u need to take our batteries
[05/19/2007 09:22:15 PM] Robert Douglas: and hit all the keys
[05/19/2007 09:22:21 PM] Robert Douglas: to remove the excess battery in the receptors
[05/19/2007 09:22:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it will fix the problem
[05/19/2007 09:22:36 PM] Robert Douglas: it happens with all laptop type keyboards
[05/19/2007 09:22:47 PM] Robert Douglas: and the bluetooth drivers SUCK when u uninstall and reinstall and shit
[05/19/2007 09:23:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i agree with that
[05/19/2007 09:23:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not using blue tooth drivers

[05/20/2007 04:45:15 PM] Robert Douglas: clickon the right arrow
[05/20/2007 04:45:37 PM] Robert Douglas: it has EASY support for ajax
[05/20/2007 04:45:48 PM] Robert Douglas: XML
[05/20/2007 04:45:54 PM] Robert Douglas: and a bunch of other incredible standards
[05/20/2007 04:46:03 PM] Robert Douglas: all this web 2.0 shit
[05/20/2007 04:46:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://extjs.com/)http://extjs.com/
[05/20/2007 04:46:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think it uses that shit
[05/20/2007 04:46:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good stuff
[05/20/2007 04:47:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications:Samples)http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:Applications:Samples
[05/20/2007 04:47:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks cool too
[05/20/2007 04:47:27 PM] Robert Douglas: lol i was reading that page
[05/20/2007 04:47:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: great minds think alike
[05/20/2007 04:48:09 PM] Robert Douglas: any questions on the jambonie stuff
[05/20/2007 04:48:41 PM] Robert Douglas: think u could get it all done in like 2 weeks?
[05/20/2007 04:50:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[05/20/2007 04:50:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll have to take a closer look
[05/20/2007 04:50:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the prices look reasonable
[05/20/2007 04:51:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i will need to devote all time to it, none of these little BS projects inbetween
[05/20/2007 04:51:13 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we might charge a lil more and have more go to RPS
[05/20/2007 04:51:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll get some of the $$ too
[05/20/2007 04:51:34 PM] Robert Douglas: since i'm gunna be designing the layout and logic for every section
[05/20/2007 04:51:49 PM] Robert Douglas: you will simply bne the lead developer
[05/20/2007 04:51:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/20/2007 04:52:10 PM] Robert Douglas: the PP portion, i already know how it will be setup
[05/20/2007 04:52:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i've done PP buttons before
[05/20/2007 04:52:18 PM] Robert Douglas: so i know what is required
[05/20/2007 04:52:35 PM] Robert Douglas: stuff like that i'll be here to talk 2 u about
[05/20/2007 04:53:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i will need your help
[05/20/2007 04:53:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is still some things to clear up on what we've done so far
[05/20/2007 04:54:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: some code conventions and consistency things
[05/20/2007 04:54:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like we need to replace the incode text with language constants
[05/20/2007 04:54:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i think i need to divide up the common.php a little more
[05/20/2007 04:55:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want to make an io.php to handle all the saving and setting of website stuff, and an error.php for error checking functions
[05/20/2007 04:55:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just giving you the heads up so you don't look at common.php and wonder where the fuck everything went
[05/20/2007 04:59:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: are we considering the zend engine at all?
[05/20/2007 05:02:06 PM] Robert Douglas: what do u mean zend engine?
[05/20/2007 05:02:09 PM] Robert Douglas: to boost performance?
[05/20/2007 05:03:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: meh
[05/20/2007 05:04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: what od u mean
[05/20/2007 05:04:23 PM] Robert Douglas: zend to encrypt our code?
[05/20/2007 05:04:31 PM] Robert Douglas: couple different types of zend
[05/20/2007 05:05:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/20/2007 05:08:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: as far as changing development studios, i like the layout of dreamweaver a lot, but i really like the error checking of eclipse
[05/20/2007 05:09:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would never want to sacrifice the ftp manager in the same convenient place as the file list in DW
[05/20/2007 05:09:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and there is an extension we could buy to get support for SVN
[05/20/2007 05:10:03 PM] Robert Douglas: phone
Session Close (Robert Douglas): Sun May 20 17:41:48 2007

[05/20/2007 06:28:40 PM] Robert Douglas: also, what items should we should more/less for?
[05/20/2007 06:28:45 PM] Robert Douglas: anything we can do cheaper?
[05/20/2007 06:29:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i will look over it
[05/20/2007 06:29:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll be doing the planning and laying out of every thing, u will be doing the implementation
[05/20/2007 06:29:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am writing up stuff for the meeting tomorrow
[05/20/2007 06:29:19 PM] Robert Douglas: get back to me within the next hour
[05/20/2007 06:29:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm sending it over to the client at 7:30
[05/20/2007 06:29:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/20/2007 06:29:37 PM] Robert Douglas: so anything u want to add/modify/remove, have it to me before that time
[05/20/2007 06:34:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/20/2007 06:35:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i bought like $45 bucks in cables from bestbuy
[05/20/2007 06:35:31 PM] Robert Douglas: Fm antenna that doesnt work
[05/20/2007 06:35:31 PM] Robert Douglas: 10 foot power extender code
[05/20/2007 06:35:31 PM] Robert Douglas: 25 foot coax cable
[05/20/2007 06:35:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i can get the same shit online, shipped 2 my house
[05/20/2007 06:35:40 PM] Robert Douglas: for like $20
[05/20/2007 06:35:41 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/20/2007 06:36:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you send these docs to client in PDF?
[05/20/2007 06:36:22 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[05/20/2007 06:36:28 PM] Robert Douglas: why
[05/20/2007 06:36:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good stuff
[05/20/2007 06:36:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i highly approve
[05/20/2007 06:36:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm so hungry
[05/20/2007 06:36:58 PM] Robert Douglas: dammit
[05/20/2007 06:37:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: calendar is not that big of deal, we are almost finished implementing it already
[05/20/2007 06:37:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: unless that is the included 1st phase price
[05/20/2007 06:37:32 PM] Robert Douglas: nah, it is extra
[05/20/2007 06:37:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah it should probably only be 250
[05/20/2007 06:38:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean even an rss feed it only going to take me an hour or two to look up specs and make a page to get it from the DB
[05/20/2007 06:39:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agree?
[05/20/2007 06:39:36 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe i will go to applebees happy hour
[05/20/2007 06:39:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol answer
[05/20/2007 06:40:15 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want rss
[05/20/2007 06:40:15 PM] Robert Douglas: we want xml
[05/20/2007 06:40:24 PM] Robert Douglas: fuck applebees happy hour doesnt start until 10pm
[05/20/2007 06:40:28 PM] Robert Douglas: 3 hours away ahhhhhh
[05/20/2007 06:40:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: rss is xml dumbass
[05/20/2007 06:41:07 PM] Robert Douglas: we need it to be xml
[05/20/2007 06:41:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not sure i understand this band member bio page? why not just link the band members to the usual member profile?
[05/20/2007 06:41:21 PM] Robert Douglas: because this is a band website
[05/20/2007 06:41:29 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to have it just like bands normally do websites
[05/20/2007 06:42:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so whats the point of having users?
[05/20/2007 06:42:32 PM] Robert Douglas: users are people that have jambonie accounts
[05/20/2007 06:42:37 PM] Robert Douglas: so they can view full band contact info
[05/20/2007 06:42:40 PM] Robert Douglas: subscrive to newsletters
[05/20/2007 06:42:46 PM] Robert Douglas: we also might implement a blog
[05/20/2007 06:42:51 PM] Robert Douglas: users will be able to post in the blog
[05/20/2007 06:42:57 PM] Robert Douglas: users will be able to view classifieds
[05/20/2007 06:42:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok but back to the calendar, it needs to be xml?
[05/20/2007 06:43:00 PM] Robert Douglas: users will be able to rate songs
[05/20/2007 06:43:04 PM] Robert Douglas: calendar? no
[05/20/2007 06:43:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh what were we talking about?
[05/20/2007 06:43:18 PM] Robert Douglas: although it might be better from a programming standpoint to do it xml
[05/20/2007 06:43:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: don't worry about thats
[05/20/2007 06:43:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is a type of output
[05/20/2007 06:43:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: xml vs html
[05/20/2007 06:43:58 PM] Robert Douglas: the jambonie player (external/internal) should work from xml
[05/20/2007 06:44:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i dunno if i can wait until 10pm tonight
[05/20/2007 06:44:19 PM] Robert Douglas: that's rpetty late to eat dinner
[05/20/2007 06:44:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i don't really understand how we are implementing the external player thing
[05/20/2007 06:45:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anywho, the calendar will send out emails, but we should offer rss feeds for bands
[05/20/2007 06:46:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if i suggest a change do you want to make it now?
[05/20/2007 06:46:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or you want me to highlight it and send the doc back?
[05/20/2007 06:46:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i cna make it now
[05/20/2007 06:46:35 PM] Robert Douglas: friday's happy hour shuts down in 14 minutes
[05/20/2007 06:46:37 PM] Robert Douglas: too late to make it their
[05/20/2007 06:46:39 PM] Robert Douglas: fuckers
[05/20/2007 06:46:48 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe i go to pei wei instead, hmmmmmm
[05/20/2007 06:47:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok calendar should be $250, band gallery should be $450, and newsletter should be $400
[05/20/2007 06:47:52 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[05/20/2007 06:47:58 PM] Robert Douglas: but keep in mind u dont get the full value right their
[05/20/2007 06:48:02 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the total price the client pays
[05/20/2007 06:48:12 PM] Robert Douglas: so u and me and rps somehow split each section
[05/20/2007 06:48:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i know, the gallery is way more to design and program then the newsletter
[05/20/2007 06:48:38 PM] Robert Douglas: ones that require more programming, and less actual logic/setup, u get paid more
[05/20/2007 06:49:03 PM] Robert Douglas: ones that require more thought process for setup/logic, and less development, i get paid more
[05/20/2007 06:49:44 PM] Robert Douglas: brb eye drops
[05/20/2007 06:49:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i know gallery is a fairly big project, newsletter i think will take a nice e-mail design and decent placement on the site and a little bit of programming
[05/20/2007 06:50:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also i think we need two more sections at the bottom
[05/20/2007 06:51:05 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to discuss database layout, maybe we should have a 2nd database?
[05/20/2007 06:51:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really how come?
[05/20/2007 06:51:18 PM] Robert Douglas: as opposed to more tables in the current one
[05/20/2007 06:51:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we only have 6 tables?
[05/20/2007 06:51:45 PM] Robert Douglas: this is the way i think it needs to be done
[05/20/2007 06:52:02 PM] Robert Douglas: pages that require only information to display songs, should not open a database that contains classifieds
[05/20/2007 06:52:18 PM] Robert Douglas: because that means we have one extra connection going to the classifieds area
[05/20/2007 06:52:23 PM] Robert Douglas: thus slowing down the mysql server
[05/20/2007 06:52:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm
[05/20/2007 06:52:31 PM] Robert Douglas: does that make sense logically?
[05/20/2007 06:52:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: interesting
[05/20/2007 06:52:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well
[05/20/2007 06:52:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never tested it at all
[05/20/2007 06:53:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: here is the thing, connections will need to be made to the regular DB for getting login information, and current tops and things that the template uses everywhere
[05/20/2007 06:53:48 PM] Robert Douglas: k, so that pretty much means it would be very very complex to implement my idea
[05/20/2007 06:53:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: , with classifieds it should be in the same DB because an sql object is already created with a connection to the current DB
[05/20/2007 06:53:56 PM] Robert Douglas: and i think at this point it is not really needed
[05/20/2007 06:54:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but you're not entirely off track
[05/20/2007 06:54:18 PM] Robert Douglas: but when the site is getting hit, we will need to think about it more, or maybe we'll invest in more hardware to help handle loads
[05/20/2007 06:54:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are certain things that in this 2nd phase that maybe should get a new DB
[05/20/2007 06:54:44 PM] Robert Douglas: what we DONT want to do, is have 2 mysql connections
[05/20/2007 06:54:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think things such as purchase records
[05/20/2007 06:55:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah definitely not 2 mysql connections
[05/20/2007 06:55:13 PM] Robert Douglas: store all the purchase info inside another db might be a good idea
[05/20/2007 06:55:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be bad, but certain purchase records that run off crons
[05/20/2007 06:55:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: furthermore certain logs that the admin will only use should run off another DB
[05/20/2007 06:55:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, the entire admin section shoujld be in its' own database, and NOT inside any piece of the website
[05/20/2007 06:56:08 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe we will make the admin be it's own sub domain
[05/20/2007 06:56:09 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[05/20/2007 06:56:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well it depends on how it applys to the site, obviously user management will use the same DB as the website uses
[05/20/2007 06:56:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because it needs to be live
[05/20/2007 06:56:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but the admins are not going to be jambonie.com accounts
[05/20/2007 06:56:56 PM] Robert Douglas: they are going to be completely separate
[05/20/2007 06:57:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but things like purchase tracking and logs, and maybe certain email options, things that are mostly external from the site should use a different DB
[05/20/2007 06:57:25 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, that would be good then
[05/20/2007 06:57:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree, they will not be jambonie accounts
[05/20/2007 06:57:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: although it was implemented quickly and cleanly, and i hate to see it go
[05/20/2007 06:57:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anywho
[05/20/2007 06:57:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: back to the outline
[05/20/2007 06:57:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need E-mail Redesign to Specification: Mostly you making a template file, and what information needs to be inserted into tags will be my end, so go ahead and make up a price based on what you think, make like $150, we just need to include more of the actual site in the email
[05/20/2007 06:58:38 PM] Robert Douglas: what u mean?
[05/20/2007 06:58:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right now the emails are plain
[05/20/2007 06:59:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that should show our banner and black background and white text just like on the site, maybe even include a few more links to different parts
[05/20/2007 07:00:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: currently our emails are purely informative which is good, like account confirmation, but when we implement the band image suggestion thing and possibly the rss feed that i keep pushing we will want a nicer looking e-mail
[05/20/2007 07:00:51 PM] Robert Douglas: sec, phone
[05/20/2007 07:01:25 PM] Robert Douglas: ffz is finally sending me the last series of images that i need
[05/20/2007 07:01:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good good
[05/20/2007 07:01:40 PM] Robert Douglas: oh, ur saying use html emails?
[05/20/2007 07:01:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/20/2007 07:01:49 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant do that, because not all email programs parse html emails
[05/20/2007 07:01:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we have the option with the email class
[05/20/2007 07:01:55 PM] Robert Douglas: some only do plain text
[05/20/2007 07:02:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there will be an option for it
[05/20/2007 07:02:07 PM] Robert Douglas: so we need to stick with plain text
[05/20/2007 07:02:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: every site offers and option
[05/20/2007 07:02:14 PM] Robert Douglas: but the end user won't know
[05/20/2007 07:02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: currently they are html e-mails
[05/20/2007 07:02:31 PM] Robert Douglas: HTML emails should be done later
[05/20/2007 07:02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: for now, we want plain text only
[05/20/2007 07:03:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: k, i'm just saying copying and pasting links for confirmation codes is a pain in the ass, and we should really consider doing it sooner then later, but i understand, since i suggested it, it should get a high priority
[05/20/2007 07:03:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: finally Search: creation and implementation of a search engine.  This is going to take a log of regex research and looking into other search engines to make it work on our database, so maybe price this one in favor of me, it should be a pretty simply page design, a few options for searching sections and a nice listed output, but the backend will need to be powerful and efficient, this will be difficult for me
[05/20/2007 07:03:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *a lot
[05/20/2007 07:04:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *and shouldn't get high priority since i suggested it
[05/20/2007 07:04:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like usual
[05/20/2007 07:05:11 PM] Robert Douglas: the HTML emails can have html links
[05/20/2007 07:05:22 PM] Robert Douglas: but they will be text for the rest
[05/20/2007 07:05:30 PM] Robert Douglas: for the search stuff, the zip code thing we're gunna need to look into
[05/20/2007 07:05:47 PM] Robert Douglas: the search for the band name,i'm not sure the best way for that yet
[05/20/2007 07:07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe we'll implement some sort of search engine technology, such as isearch
[05/20/2007 07:07:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way both will use part of the same search script, it just depends on how much of it you want me to implement now, just the zip codes for events in your area and classifieds won't be too hard, i've seen the IP resolve thing done before, i think there is even a linux command for it, but eventually a user should have the option to search by band, and for that i will need to add a lot more to the current search script
[05/20/2007 07:07:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and have that be the thing that powers our site's search
[05/20/2007 07:08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: the zip codes in ur area will be where u enter a zip code, and then it will find a bunch of results based on zip codes within 50 miles from the zip code u entered
[05/20/2007 07:08:48 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to buy a license to use the USPS zip code database
[05/20/2007 07:08:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way it will take me a while to implement that, but i think it can wait until final phase
[05/20/2007 07:09:06 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, the searching and zip code shit should be the last thing we do i think
[05/20/2007 07:10:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i really think that we should implement the email, maybe not in this phase, but fewer and fewer clients still don't support html, and we can always offer the alternative in the email like other sites do
[05/20/2007 07:10:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and since its smarty its really easy to implement into the site
[05/20/2007 07:10:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even both types would be easy to implement
[05/20/2007 07:11:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that can wait until final phase as well
[05/20/2007 07:11:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think we are still inserting confirmation codes automatically lol
[05/20/2007 07:12:59 PM] Robert Douglas: phone
[05/20/2007 07:18:41 PM] Robert Douglas: omg they are so retarded
[05/20/2007 07:20:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: who?
[05/20/2007 07:20:20 PM] Robert Douglas: ffz
[05/20/2007 07:20:21 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/20/2007 07:20:26 PM] Robert Douglas: they sent me pictures over
[05/20/2007 07:20:30 PM] Robert Douglas: but they are for two pages
[05/20/2007 07:20:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wtf
[05/20/2007 07:20:41 PM] Robert Douglas: and only have like 1/3rd the amount of pics i need
[05/20/2007 07:20:47 PM] Robert Douglas: for the programs and rentals page
[05/20/2007 07:20:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i also asked them for some class information
[05/20/2007 07:20:58 PM] Robert Douglas: so i can test the class stuff and make sure it works
[05/20/2007 07:21:16 PM] Robert Douglas: then they wanted me to explain why we can use the current test data
[05/20/2007 07:21:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you shouldn't say "make sure it works" to a client, it instills doubt
[05/20/2007 07:21:38 PM] Robert Douglas: and so i tried to explain to them that we need real data to test it
[05/20/2007 07:21:42 PM] Robert Douglas: she goes
[05/20/2007 07:21:46 PM] Robert Douglas: "i dont understand":
[05/20/2007 07:21:47 PM] Robert Douglas: fucking retard
[05/20/2007 07:22:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need a new protocol for dealing with dumbass clients
[05/20/2007 07:22:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i think i am gunna order a pizza
[05/20/2007 07:22:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should even have to use the word "test" because then they think we don't have our shit together

[05/21/2007 10:51:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i dunno what else is needed other than adding it to virtual host
[05/21/2007 10:51:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it should show the same thing as ns1
[05/21/2007 10:52:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if there is no virtual host it uses default
[05/21/2007 10:52:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have it set up as virtual host *
[05/21/2007 10:52:53 PM] Robert Douglas: well, if i manually put 209.250.30.30(Link: www.bjcullinan.com)www.bjcullinan.com
[05/21/2007 10:52:56 PM] Robert Douglas: into my xp host's file
[05/21/2007 10:52:57 PM] Robert Douglas: it works
[05/21/2007 10:53:01 PM] Robert Douglas: without that, it doesnt work
[05/21/2007 10:53:07 PM] Robert Douglas: so maybe it still need to propagate
[05/21/2007 10:53:07 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[05/21/2007 10:53:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it works?
[05/21/2007 10:53:20 PM] Robert Douglas: it works when i add it to my comptuer's host file
[05/21/2007 10:53:23 PM] Robert Douglas: but it doesn't work without it
[05/21/2007 10:53:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so that means it could be propagatioon issue
[05/21/2007 10:53:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[05/21/2007 10:53:29 PM] Robert Douglas: let me check
[05/21/2007 10:53:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:53:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: must just need up to 24 hours
[05/21/2007 10:53:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no biggie

[05/21/2007 10:54:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i've waited this long for it
[05/21/2007 10:54:08 PM] Robert Douglas: that tells u where ur domain is pointing to from multiple servers all around the world
[05/21/2007 10:54:17 PM] Robert Douglas: if it doesnt say ur IP address, then the domain hasnt propagated
[05/21/2007 10:54:30 PM] Robert Douglas: if it has been 24 hours, and it still doesnt say ur IP,then it is fault of the domain configuration
[05/21/2007 10:55:21 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/lookup.ch?&name=bjcullinan.com&type=NS)http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/lookup.ch?&name=bjcullinan.com&type=NS shows what ur domain is pointing to
[05/21/2007 10:56:10 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ping.ch?&ip=bjcullinan.com)http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/ping.ch?&ip=bjcullinan.com tells me if your domain (which has already been tested to show that it has NS1/NS2 servers) is in fact working
[05/21/2007 10:56:12 PM] Robert Douglas: and the domain is working
[05/21/2007 10:56:16 PM] Robert Douglas: but something on ur server end is fucked
[05/21/2007 10:56:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so the cache is what we are waiting on
[05/21/2007 10:56:38 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[05/21/2007 10:56:43 PM] Robert Douglas: ur server needs some modification
[05/21/2007 10:56:45 PM] Robert Douglas: something isnt right
[05/21/2007 10:56:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but you said when you put it into hosts file it worked
[05/21/2007 10:57:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/21/2007 10:58:07 PM] Robert Douglas: that means ur server isn't accepting the domain correctly
[05/21/2007 10:58:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but if it worked in your hosts then it is
[05/21/2007 10:58:27 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[05/21/2007 10:58:46 PM] Robert Douglas: it just displays what is located at the IP address
[05/21/2007 10:59:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am confused
[05/21/2007 10:59:15 PM] Robert Douglas: double check all of ur settings
[05/21/2007 10:59:20 PM] Robert Douglas: if u still think everything is 100%
[05/21/2007 10:59:24 PM] Robert Douglas: let's wait an hour
[05/21/2007 10:59:27 PM] Robert Douglas: and see if anything happens
[05/21/2007 11:00:13 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie put int he 1500
[05/21/2007 11:00:18 PM] Robert Douglas: so i will cut u a check tomorrow
[05/21/2007 11:00:20 PM] Robert Douglas: and send it out
[05/21/2007 11:01:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cut my check?
[05/21/2007 11:01:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want to whole thing
[05/21/2007 11:01:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: j/k i can wait
[05/21/2007 11:01:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i better fucking get to money before school starts again
[05/21/2007 11:01:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think it has propagated yet

[05/22/2007 09:01:50 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm about 99% sure that sugar will NOT be able to handle documents for now, so we might have to do an SVN or something else to do it until sugar can handle them the way we want

[05/22/2007 10:02:05 AM] Robert Douglas: this right here, is why you are not our server admin for our servers
[05/22/2007 10:02:16 AM] Robert Douglas: not saying i know how it works
[05/22/2007 10:02:29 AM] Robert Douglas: but this is why we pay someone who has been doing this shit for years, to be able to fix issues asap
[05/22/2007 10:03:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if it propagates later and starts working without me changing anything
[05/22/2007 10:03:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i will take that as an insult not truth
[05/22/2007 10:03:55 AM] Robert Douglas: it would be an insult to me

[05/22/2007 11:37:23 AM] Robert Douglas: that's the one
[05/22/2007 11:37:36 AM] Robert Douglas: r u rdy for meeting?
[05/22/2007 11:37:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/22/2007 11:38:02 AM] Robert Douglas: first step is to talk about what we need to do, then we'll figure out what requirements we need from server/software standpoint
[05/22/2007 11:38:10 AM] Robert Douglas: how does svn handle user control?
[05/22/2007 11:38:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: through a passwd file
[05/22/2007 11:38:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its simple user = password
[05/22/2007 11:38:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not very secure
[05/22/2007 11:38:50 AM] Robert Douglas: you mean the username and password are the same?
[05/22/2007 11:38:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no
[05/22/2007 11:39:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean thats how it is set
[05/22/2007 11:39:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: in the config
[05/22/2007 11:39:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: user = password
[05/22/2007 11:39:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: simple
[05/22/2007 11:39:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not secure
[05/22/2007 11:39:25 AM] Robert Douglas: ok,but that can be changed then to use the normal htpasswd right?
[05/22/2007 11:39:36 AM] Robert Douglas: or does it use a diff kind of password?
[05/22/2007 11:39:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: different kind of password
[05/22/2007 11:39:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think it can be changed because it has to have that layout
[05/22/2007 11:40:11 AM] Robert Douglas: we cant have the password be = to the username
[05/22/2007 11:40:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no no no
[05/22/2007 11:40:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nvm that
[05/22/2007 11:40:36 AM] Robert Douglas: how does it store user/pass,and why is it not secure
[05/22/2007 11:40:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it stores it user = password
[05/22/2007 11:40:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: literally
[05/22/2007 11:41:04 AM] Robert Douglas: so the user and pass are the same
[05/22/2007 11:41:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not username is equal to password
[05/22/2007 11:41:08 AM] Robert Douglas: or that is the format it stores it in
[05/22/2007 11:41:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats the format
[05/22/2007 11:41:17 AM] Robert Douglas: that's fine
[05/22/2007 11:41:22 AM] Robert Douglas: is the pw md5?
[05/22/2007 11:41:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but its not encrypted or anything
[05/22/2007 11:41:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no
[05/22/2007 11:41:42 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[05/22/2007 11:41:47 AM] Robert Douglas: that's too bad,that that's not an issue
[05/22/2007 11:41:54 AM] Robert Douglas: because few people will have access tot he pw file anyways
[05/22/2007 11:42:17 AM] Robert Douglas: how does it handle folder permissions?
[05/22/2007 11:42:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not sure how it does it in the actual SVN, but i can find out
[05/22/2007 11:43:18 AM] Robert Douglas: well, we need to know if we are able to allow certain users only specific folder access
[05/22/2007 11:43:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks like it can be done
[05/22/2007 11:43:24 AM] Robert Douglas: that is going to be a HUGE point
[05/22/2007 11:43:46 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, so we can set it up so that alex can't see a specific folder
[05/22/2007 11:43:53 AM] Robert Douglas: and that I cant see a specific folder
[05/22/2007 11:43:54 AM] Robert Douglas: right?
[05/22/2007 11:44:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/22/2007 11:44:14 AM] Robert Douglas: so let's say we dont want alex to have access to the client's folder, and we don't want me to have access to a protocol folder
[05/22/2007 11:44:19 AM] Robert Douglas: that will be possible?
[05/22/2007 11:45:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am looking into it
[05/22/2007 11:45:25 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, u want 5 mins to look into it, or shall we continue?
[05/22/2007 11:47:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lets continue might take some time
[05/22/2007 11:47:19 AM] Robert Douglas: k
[05/22/2007 11:47:24 AM] Robert Douglas: make a note that u need to reserasrch that k?
[05/22/2007 11:47:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/22/2007 11:47:53 AM] Robert Douglas: svn can be setup to display as a hard drive under Myu Comp,right?
[05/22/2007 11:48:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can, but i don't recommend it
[05/22/2007 11:48:18 AM] Robert Douglas: why not
[05/22/2007 11:48:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is an option for using webdav, but its not completely developed, then we could use remote drive like netdrive to access that
[05/22/2007 11:49:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but svn is folder based
[05/22/2007 11:49:10 AM] Robert Douglas: netdrive blows
[05/22/2007 11:49:19 AM] Robert Douglas: can u link me to the info about webdav
[05/22/2007 11:49:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tortoise works off of using folders that contain svn projects
[05/22/2007 11:49:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: google.com
[05/22/2007 11:49:39 AM] Robert Douglas: that's not gunna cut it
[05/22/2007 11:49:48 AM] Robert Douglas: send me the info about the webdav not being fully development
[05/22/2007 11:49:50 AM] Robert Douglas: developed
[05/22/2007 11:50:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just from my experience, i had problems with it
[05/22/2007 11:50:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but thats not a proper implementation of it
[05/22/2007 11:50:20 AM] Robert Douglas: how am i supposed to find your expereince using google?
[05/22/2007 11:50:21 AM] Robert Douglas: wtf
[05/22/2007 11:50:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: people need to use client software to access the svn
[05/22/2007 11:50:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tortoise is perfect for this
[05/22/2007 11:50:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can look up webdav in google, i don't have the link off hand
[05/22/2007 11:50:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because i don't use it
[05/22/2007 11:51:14 AM] Robert Douglas: i wasnt asking about webdav, i was asking about webdav support and not being fully developed
[05/22/2007 11:51:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't have a link for that either
[05/22/2007 11:51:39 AM] Robert Douglas: i think it would be great to have a hard drive that lets you grab the documents
[05/22/2007 11:52:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it would be nice, but that isn't the way SVN works, i worked with alex on this yesterday, you should have a folder in my documents that says for example the name of the project, then you checkout that project from the SVN and everything is contained in that folder
[05/22/2007 11:53:09 AM] Robert Douglas: sn has webdavsupport for browing though
[05/22/2007 11:53:12 AM] Robert Douglas: svn
[05/22/2007 11:53:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2007 11:53:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i never got writing to work
[05/22/2007 11:53:58 AM] Robert Douglas: dont think u can write to it
[05/22/2007 11:54:02 AM] Robert Douglas: i think u can only browse
[05/22/2007 11:54:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way they will need to use the client
[05/22/2007 11:54:46 AM] Robert Douglas: alright, well, we can live without a mapped webdav drive to the svn
[05/22/2007 11:54:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/22/2007 11:55:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: next?
[05/22/2007 11:55:35 AM] Robert Douglas: so, developers will connect to the svn client, then grab the website he is wroking on
[05/22/2007 11:55:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2007 11:55:54 AM] Robert Douglas: it has full support for file locking?
[05/22/2007 11:56:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: haven't tried that, i recommend still used check in and check out when we have you and i for example going back and forth on a lot of files, but we should test that
[05/22/2007 11:57:05 AM] Robert Douglas: k, isn't a big deal, just trying to understand it more
[05/22/2007 11:57:47 AM] Robert Douglas: can you find out about the permission based folders/files for me, and get back to me when you have that info?
[05/22/2007 11:57:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but we will definitely use it when large changes are made and we can commit the entire project, but i recommend we test that
[05/22/2007 11:58:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, can we continue with the next subject though?
[05/22/2007 11:58:42 AM] Robert Douglas: depending on how the permissions are, will make new questions
[05/22/2007 11:58:50 AM] Robert Douglas: such as the setup of the initial layout
[05/22/2007 11:58:55 AM] Robert Douglas: it will depend on how permissions work
[05/22/2007 11:59:20 AM] Robert Douglas: so that's it for now, until we know what the deal is with folder/file permissions
[05/22/2007 11:59:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok but we need to discuss what we are going to use it for
[05/22/2007 11:59:35 AM] Robert Douglas: we need to figure outhow to allow/restrict access for files/folders
[05/22/2007 11:59:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we use it for documents we need to be able to submit http links in sugar
[05/22/2007 12:00:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would solve the problem of using sugar and svn
[05/22/2007 12:00:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we wouldn't have to use them seperately
[05/22/2007 12:00:17 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not gunna integrate it into sugar right now
[05/22/2007 12:00:21 PM] Robert Douglas: it is completely separate
[05/22/2007 12:00:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that we need to plan ahead
[05/22/2007 12:00:52 PM] Robert Douglas: linking itinto sugar right now is not an option
[05/22/2007 12:00:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we make plans for the future implementations, then we can implement it correctly now
[05/22/2007 12:01:22 PM] Robert Douglas: once sugar develops their software futher, we can discuss future implemntation
[05/22/2007 12:01:28 PM] Robert Douglas: but right now, it isn't even an option forus to explore
[05/22/2007 12:04:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks like if we use apache and dav permissions are easy
[05/22/2007 12:04:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we decided not to use webdav
[05/22/2007 12:05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: using webdav with apache is appropriate, i thought you meant using it to view it solely as a hard drive and its own file system
[05/22/2007 12:06:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: with apache it integrates nicely, and the svn can be written to, but it is still through a client
[05/22/2007 12:06:38 PM] Robert Douglas: ok that will be nice
[05/22/2007 12:06:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not webdav
[05/22/2007 12:06:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its just called Dav
[05/22/2007 12:06:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my mistake
[05/22/2007 12:06:49 PM] Robert Douglas: what about svn permissions?
[05/22/2007 12:07:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can do permissions if it goes through apache
[05/22/2007 12:07:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is very simple too
[05/22/2007 12:07:51 PM] Robert Douglas: explain how folder restrictions will work
[05/22/2007 12:08:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can do it through regular files and an include
[05/22/2007 12:09:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we use the Location directive
[05/22/2007 12:09:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and specify the user and group required in there
[05/22/2007 12:09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: so you can have it setup so that it will only display folders you have access to?
[05/22/2007 12:09:27 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[05/22/2007 12:09:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2007 12:09:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also going through apache we can avoid using the standard SVN passwd
[05/22/2007 12:09:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so no more user = password
[05/22/2007 12:10:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can use apache restrictions
[05/22/2007 12:10:13 PM] Robert Douglas: does apache need to be reset when those changes are made?
[05/22/2007 12:10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: but the user = password is still required to connect to the svn client
[05/22/2007 12:10:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes but i might be able to find a workaround
[05/22/2007 12:11:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so there will be two entries for each user'sconfig
[05/22/2007 12:11:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we don't need the user = password at all, the svn client will require a password based on apache
[05/22/2007 12:11:12 PM] Robert Douglas: the first is the default user/pass used to connect to the svn client
[05/22/2007 12:11:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will still be secure without a default password, we can require it through apache
[05/22/2007 12:11:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the svn client will be able to handle it
[05/22/2007 12:12:01 PM] Robert Douglas: but the svn client will use that info?
[05/22/2007 12:12:01 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[05/22/2007 12:12:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2007 12:12:16 PM] Robert Douglas: and it will still NOT display folders that you do not have access to
[05/22/2007 12:12:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: correct
[05/22/2007 12:12:23 PM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[05/22/2007 12:12:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will be just like on a regular website when it pops up with login information
[05/22/2007 12:13:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or with a login dialog
[05/22/2007 12:13:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and requires a login
[05/22/2007 12:14:52 PM] Robert Douglas: how will you access the page to prompt with the login info, if it is not going to be displayed in the first place?
[05/22/2007 12:15:03 PM] Robert Douglas: because we dont want someone to be able to see the folder to begin with
[05/22/2007 12:15:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the svn client will see that a password is required and prompt for it when you try to open the folder
[05/22/2007 12:16:15 PM] Robert Douglas: but we dont want people to be able to see the folder
[05/22/2007 12:16:19 PM] Robert Douglas: unless they have access to it
[05/22/2007 12:16:32 PM] Robert Douglas: you said you wont be able to see the folders unless you are not restricted
[05/22/2007 12:16:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it doesn't know what user they are to hide it from
[05/22/2007 12:17:10 PM] Robert Douglas: so any usernot logged in, will be able to see every single folder?
[05/22/2007 12:17:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so they will always have to link directly to the folder they are trying to get to because they won't be able to see it
[05/22/2007 12:18:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this all depends on how we set up the file system
[05/22/2007 12:18:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can use multiple groups in the required authorization
[05/22/2007 12:19:32 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as u can make it so that unauthorized users are unable to see folders they shouldnt be able to see, that's fine
[05/22/2007 12:20:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see the folders i don't think is possible and i don't think it matters, accessing them obviously does matter, and that we can accomplish
[05/22/2007 12:20:21 PM] Robert Douglas: it does matter to be able to see the folders
[05/22/2007 12:20:28 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want people to know all of our clients
[05/22/2007 12:20:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then those people shouldn't have access to the clients folder
[05/22/2007 12:20:56 PM] Robert Douglas: they will see the client's folder
[05/22/2007 12:21:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but they will be able to see the Clients folder exists
[05/22/2007 12:21:32 PM] Robert Douglas: if we have a developer come onboard for an hour, and we provide him access to the svn so he can work on one client's website, they will be able to see every single folder in our svn
[05/22/2007 12:22:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then we can give just that user access to the website folder that he is working on
[05/22/2007 12:22:20 PM] Robert Douglas: but he will be able to see the other folders
[05/22/2007 12:22:26 PM] Robert Douglas: "b.cullinan@cox.net says: 
but they will be able to see the Clients folder exists"
[05/22/2007 12:23:03 PM] Robert Douglas: see what i mean, and the issue i'm getting at?
[05/22/2007 12:23:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i understand that you don't want a developer to see that we have clients
[05/22/2007 12:23:37 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[05/22/2007 12:23:46 PM] Robert Douglas: or see that we have a document management area
[05/22/2007 12:23:52 PM] Robert Douglas: or see that we have a contract folder
[05/22/2007 12:23:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because knowing they exists he could go out and destroy everything we have
[05/22/2007 12:24:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well then we won't give the developer to the parent of those other folders
[05/22/2007 12:24:30 PM] Robert Douglas: no, it is because that is company information that developers should NOT have knowledge abuot
[05/22/2007 12:24:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you are thinking on the wrong level
[05/22/2007 12:25:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: apache restricts access to a folder, so all the contents of that folder cannot be seen, however the folder with the restricted access can be seen
[05/22/2007 12:25:27 PM] Robert Douglas: right,  i understand that
[05/22/2007 12:25:29 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the issue
[05/22/2007 12:25:37 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want everyone with access to svn to be able to see every folder
[05/22/2007 12:25:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well it shouldn't be an issue
[05/22/2007 12:26:02 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want our developers to be able to see our company folders, that are unrelated to the developers
[05/22/2007 12:26:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then he won't have access to the folder that contains those folders
[05/22/2007 12:26:42 PM] Robert Douglas: but he will still be able to access the client folder, and see all other client folders
[05/22/2007 12:27:05 PM] Robert Douglas: he may not be able to go inside the folder
[05/22/2007 12:27:08 PM] Robert Douglas: but he will still see it
[05/22/2007 12:27:43 PM] Robert Douglas: there will be other situations too, where we will run into this issue, just using the developer as an easy understandable example
[05/22/2007 12:28:16 PM] Robert Douglas: u said u only had an hour, about an hour ago
[05/22/2007 12:28:22 PM] Robert Douglas: and i have other stuff to do too
[05/22/2007 12:28:25 PM] Robert Douglas: thought meeeting would take 1 hr
[05/22/2007 12:28:36 PM] Robert Douglas: why dont you reseahrc this issue further, and get back with me later?

[05/22/2007 12:31:30 PM] Robert Douglas: where are u
[05/22/2007 12:31:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am done discussing this with you
[05/22/2007 12:31:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, time is up
[05/22/2007 12:32:00 PM] Robert Douglas: i got other shit to work on
[05/22/2007 12:32:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i don't appreciate you taking over this project at if it were your own
[05/22/2007 12:32:21 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm not taking it over, but you're not going to implement anything until we know it works
[05/22/2007 12:32:27 PM] Robert Douglas: and there are still issues with ur svn idea
[05/22/2007 12:32:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i should have had access you the servers svn to come up with configurations that work for us, but instead i have to do all the testing and layout configurations on my own server
[05/22/2007 12:33:11 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to configure apache 2 on the server too
[05/22/2007 12:33:14 PM] Robert Douglas: before anything can be done
[05/22/2007 12:33:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and thats where the problem lies, is i don't have access to the server that i need to implement even test configurations that we should have
[05/22/2007 12:33:19 PM] Robert Douglas: but before we do that, we need to make sure svn works
[05/22/2007 12:33:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, you are doing things in the wrong order
[05/22/2007 12:33:37 PM] Robert Douglas: and it sounds like, we have a pretty big issue
[05/22/2007 12:33:55 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, well u already have svn on ur machine
[05/22/2007 12:33:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should have the stuff installed at we need in order to test and create examples of how it should work
[05/22/2007 12:34:03 PM] Robert Douglas: so continue testing on their to figure out the questions u dont have answers to
[05/22/2007 12:34:18 PM] Robert Douglas: let me know when you figure out the answer, and we'll continue
[05/22/2007 12:34:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so how about i say this, i will not work on this project any more until i have a jshell with the things that i need
[05/22/2007 12:34:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not going to work out the projects on my own server
[05/22/2007 12:34:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is a personal server and should not have to contain company resourses
[05/22/2007 12:34:55 PM] Robert Douglas: if u want to stepdown from the svn, just say so
[05/22/2007 12:35:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want to waste anymore time than i have to
[05/22/2007 12:35:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not stepping down, i am saying that you will not give me control over the project, and i do not have the resources to test what is needed for the implementation 
[05/22/2007 12:36:41 PM] Robert Douglas: what does ur machine not have that you need?
[05/22/2007 12:37:09 PM] Robert Douglas: u have 3 mins left until i take off

[05/23/2007 10:10:40 AM] Robert Douglas: y0
[05/23/2007 11:49:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm here now
[05/23/2007 11:59:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i keep getting timeouts when trying to get to that link you gave me
[05/23/2007 12:01:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it says nybeauty.com is not found
[05/23/2007 12:15:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah the problem with the domain name definitely isn't on my end
[05/23/2007 12:15:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all of my other domains work, and ping doesn't even resolve to anything
[05/23/2007 12:15:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: both the name servers work too
[05/23/2007 12:16:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and where you put something in hosts it doesn't just show what is at that address, is acts like a dns host server
[05/23/2007 12:16:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so apache reads the address as if it were actually coming from that domain name
[05/23/2007 12:17:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and to prove it, i have put all my current domains into the hosts file before and sent them to the local ip address (192.168.*) and it shows every different website as a virtual host in apache
[05/23/2007 12:18:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so the problem with the domain definitely isn't on my end, even ping should resolve an ip address

[05/23/2007 12:57:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now it works
[05/23/2007 12:57:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: without adding to my host file
[05/23/2007 12:57:57 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[05/23/2007 12:58:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: want to fix my website?
[05/23/2007 12:58:09 PM] Robert Douglas: you mean bjcullinan.com?
[05/23/2007 12:58:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/23/2007 12:58:27 PM] Robert Douglas: everything is configured correctly from the domain name side of things
[05/23/2007 12:58:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: does it forward to a name server at rps?
[05/23/2007 12:59:07 PM] Robert Douglas: no, i gave u the DNS
[05/23/2007 12:59:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ns1.bjcullinan.com/ns2.bjcullinan.com
[05/23/2007 12:59:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[05/23/2007 12:59:30 PM] Robert Douglas: RPS isnt the host
[05/23/2007 12:59:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i need a dns server?
[05/23/2007 12:59:48 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure
[05/23/2007 12:59:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never done this before
[05/23/2007 01:00:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how do you configure regular domains?
[05/23/2007 01:00:22 PM] Robert Douglas: the same way, but i create the accoun inside of cpanel
[05/23/2007 01:00:26 PM] Robert Douglas: then it adds the host info into the config
[05/23/2007 01:00:38 PM] Robert Douglas: if u want, i can see if we can host the domain
[05/23/2007 01:00:44 PM] Robert Douglas: and have our admins just forward it to an IP
[05/23/2007 01:00:47 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno if that will work tho
[05/23/2007 01:01:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it should if you are running a dns
[05/23/2007 01:01:20 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/23/2007 01:02:22 PM] Robert Douglas: did u have a chance to take a look at skinning nybeauty?
[05/23/2007 01:02:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i will get the files now
[05/23/2007 01:02:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think the missing link is i don't have a DNS server
[05/23/2007 01:02:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and configuring it is a pain in the ass
[05/23/2007 01:03:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need IP forwarding, like when DynDNS does
[05/23/2007 01:03:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or the rps server can do
[05/23/2007 01:03:25 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, no worries
[05/23/2007 01:03:28 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll put it on rps
[05/23/2007 01:03:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so if you have that domain sent to rps instead, then rps can forward it for me
[05/23/2007 01:04:17 PM] Robert Douglas: IP again plz
[05/23/2007 01:04:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 209.250.30.30

[05/24/2007 12:01:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fuck
[05/24/2007 12:02:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it would make it a lot easier if you used things like first-child in the css
[05/24/2007 12:02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for on the left side
[05/24/2007 12:02:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: where the first check is different from the middle ones
[05/24/2007 12:03:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and as far as the products go, use a float for each product, not right middle and left
[05/24/2007 12:03:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just float them next to each other
[05/24/2007 12:03:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i have to go to photown now
[05/24/2007 12:03:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i want to explain to you where i left off
[05/24/2007 12:04:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is possible to do this and still have it validate
[05/24/2007 12:05:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what i have been doing is insert the new template code at the top and the move all the if cases and inserted values up and out of the original template as it makes sense
[05/24/2007 12:05:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: our validated code will be a lot shorter then a shitload of embeded tables
[05/24/2007 12:06:17 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/24/2007 12:06:25 PM] Robert Douglas: it is looking good so far
[05/24/2007 12:06:31 PM] Robert Douglas: and, i dont care how it is coded, i care if it works and looks good
[05/24/2007 12:06:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so finally i left off under skin1/customer/main/products.tpl
[05/24/2007 12:06:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats where it prints out each product
[05/24/2007 12:07:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well the css depends on our design, thats why i've been sticking to the same code
[05/24/2007 12:07:18 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[05/24/2007 12:07:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and also i changed menu.tpl for the left side, but the actual links are somewhere else, possibly hard coded
[05/24/2007 12:07:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but those two pages are the last BIG changes
[05/24/2007 12:07:51 PM] Robert Douglas: the menu.tpl controls the left column'smenu
[05/24/2007 12:07:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then we can get into the little details
[05/24/2007 12:08:11 PM] Robert Douglas: it uses a dialog.tpl
[05/24/2007 12:08:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i changes that, but it just inserts $content into the menu
[05/24/2007 12:08:14 PM] Robert Douglas: to control the box
[05/24/2007 12:08:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/24/2007 12:08:28 PM] Robert Douglas: search for VertMenuItems

[05/31/2007 09:09:05 AM] Robert Douglas: dont have one note on the machine yet
[05/31/2007 09:09:10 AM] Robert Douglas: i had to reinstall the entireoffice suite
[05/31/2007 09:09:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hot
[05/31/2007 09:09:25 AM] Robert Douglas: but gl with the meeting with alex
[05/31/2007 09:09:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[05/31/2007 09:09:37 AM] Robert Douglas: dont forget that i'll be asking him questions
[05/31/2007 09:09:41 AM] Robert Douglas: once u guys settle on it
[05/31/2007 09:09:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: have it done by friday or whatever when you want to read it and give me feedback
[05/31/2007 09:10:09 AM] Robert Douglas: i liked the new idea for the multiple svn config implementation
[05/31/2007 09:10:16 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its my final solution if you will, i've played around with scenarios for hours and couldn't come up with anything else that worked
[05/31/2007 09:10:29 AM] Robert Douglas: well, i have a strong feeling this one will work
[05/31/2007 09:10:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah that was the main part
[05/31/2007 09:10:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: seperate config for each folder but it has some disadvantages
[05/31/2007 09:11:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like you can't go to the path above that and have it list its children
[05/31/2007 09:11:36 AM] Robert Douglas: well, that's the point though
[05/31/2007 09:11:44 AM] Robert Douglas: to restrict people from doing that
[05/31/2007 09:11:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, but even overall admins can't
[05/31/2007 09:12:09 AM] Robert Douglas: admins can have full access right?
[05/31/2007 09:12:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well they can't have a password that works for every config yes
[05/31/2007 09:12:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but for the folder that contains all the svns, they can't list them all out
[05/31/2007 09:12:59 AM] Robert Douglas: they can just have a root password that has access to all i thought?
[05/31/2007 09:13:09 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/31/2007 09:13:15 AM] Robert Douglas: yup, so that should be fine i think
[05/31/2007 09:13:25 AM] Robert Douglas: how do u like the business card

[05/31/2007 09:59:32 AM] Robert Douglas: of the function
[05/31/2007 09:59:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you didn't put that in the form
[05/31/2007 10:00:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: <form action="" method="post" onsubmit="return checkFields(this)">
[05/31/2007 10:00:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: must be return so if it fails we cancel the submit
[05/31/2007 10:00:33 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/31/2007 10:00:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because checkfields will return false
[05/31/2007 10:00:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so onsubmit will return false
[05/31/2007 10:00:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: noobishness
[05/31/2007 10:00:51 AM] Robert Douglas: i put it on the submit button

[05/31/2007 10:09:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: DW ftp sucks ass
[05/31/2007 10:09:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but at least it has an ftp unlike eclipse
[05/31/2007 10:10:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so copy the <script> again, and copy the onsubmit function again
[05/31/2007 10:10:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: actually that one can stay the same

[05/31/2007 09:06:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need admin section
[05/31/2007 09:07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to go through and familiarize myself with xcart, figure out what settings can be changed without modding template
[05/31/2007 09:12:28 PM] Robert Douglas: someone changed the nyb cpanel info
[05/31/2007 09:12:34 PM] Robert Douglas: YXMoIolNX4 is no longer the pw
[05/31/2007 09:12:40 PM] Robert Douglas: same with ftp
[05/31/2007 09:12:49 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have the nyb ftp password?
[05/31/2007 09:13:20 PM] Robert Douglas: nvm, the new pw is YXMoIolNX4 which is what is inside the database
[05/31/2007 09:13:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/31/2007 09:13:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i am uyploading the skin1 dir again
[05/31/2007 09:14:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i think i did a similar thing that u r doing with xcart
[05/31/2007 09:14:12 PM] Robert Douglas: so dont get frustrated
[05/31/2007 09:14:22 PM] Robert Douglas: and remember that commenting out is better than deleting
[05/31/2007 09:14:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i'll plug away at it tonight
[05/31/2007 09:14:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we need to write some nice client software for handling meetings
[05/31/2007 09:14:50 PM] Robert Douglas: we might be better off using a monthly service
[05/31/2007 09:14:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sure we can sync sugar with outlook, but i don't think its very reliable
[05/31/2007 09:15:00 PM] Robert Douglas: also, nice job with the image program
[05/31/2007 09:16:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am talking about deamons on client machines that can actually access sugar databases and add meetings and alert users of meetings
[05/31/2007 09:17:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am talking implement some nice features like creating secure connections between clients for faster file transfer then IM
[05/31/2007 09:17:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: some like, quick shortcut buttons to things like opening certain documents and accessing SVN directly and opening the client software in the right location
[05/31/2007 09:18:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all accessible through like a little panel that can be brought up by clicking an icon in the taskbar
[05/31/2007 09:18:32 PM] Robert Douglas: that might be something good to bring uplater tho,dont u think?
[05/31/2007 09:18:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think we will have time to implement something so complex and thought out for quite awhile
[05/31/2007 09:19:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah its low priority, but i think it can be useful
[05/31/2007 09:19:17 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, later on we will have an ultimate solution to handle allof our little shitty problems
[05/31/2007 09:19:27 PM] Robert Douglas: SVN is big for us,but it is something more important than some other things
[05/31/2007 09:19:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so we're gunna roll with it soon i think
[05/31/2007 09:20:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just the meeting thing was important
[05/31/2007 09:20:07 PM] Robert Douglas: all i had to eat todayt was a bowl of cereal and some fries lol
[05/31/2007 09:20:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think the outlook handles meetings well enough
[05/31/2007 09:20:34 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe i'll go to on the border
[05/31/2007 09:20:39 PM] Robert Douglas: fuck that would rock right now man

[05/31/2007 09:22:20 PM] Robert Douglas: so give me a call if u got a uqestion
[05/31/2007 09:22:29 PM] Robert Douglas: xcart can be a bitch, they made the entire system really complicated lol
[05/31/2007 09:22:39 PM] Robert Douglas: but it scales very well
[05/31/2007 09:24:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think just the fucking spacing making it harder
[05/31/2007 09:24:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they don't fucking indent at all
[05/31/2007 09:25:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: white-space doesn't cost anything, especially with gzip on

[06/05/2007 09:24:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i understand it a lot better
[06/05/2007 09:25:52 PM] Robert Douglas: what do you need to install other than svn, and what type of account access do you need?
[06/05/2007 09:26:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: svn should already be installed last time we attempted to do this
[06/05/2007 09:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i just need a jshell and access to svnadmin, but you don't have to be root to use it
[06/05/2007 09:26:49 PM] Robert Douglas: we gotta figure out the best setup for everything
[06/05/2007 09:26:55 PM] Robert Douglas: should we make a cpanel account?

[06/12/2007 01:20:19 PM] Robert Douglas: Alex says: 
a bird shit on me today
[06/12/2007 01:21:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[06/12/2007 01:33:46 PM] Robert Douglas: are you familiar with the image program you guys researched?
[06/12/2007 01:34:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am
[06/12/2007 01:34:32 PM] Robert Douglas: how do we have the image program specify the new thumbnail size?
[06/12/2007 01:34:37 PM] Robert Douglas: do we send the client a config file
[06/12/2007 01:34:42 PM] Robert Douglas: or have the client change something on their end?
[06/12/2007 01:34:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: just have them change the new size on their end
[06/12/2007 01:35:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so there isnt a config file that we send over
[06/12/2007 01:37:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: as far as i know its all controlled by the interface
[06/12/2007 01:37:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: haven't looked into the documentation very much, i never owned it
[06/12/2007 02:00:53 PM] Robert Douglas: are you rdy to implement the band calendar?
[06/12/2007 02:01:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: not quite yet
[06/12/2007 02:02:22 PM] Robert Douglas: do you have the phase 2 yet?
[06/12/2007 02:02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: if so, can you tell me the cost i have listed for the band calendar
[06/12/2007 02:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: seems as though i miss placed it
[06/12/2007 02:07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: you dont store it in a folder?
[06/12/2007 02:07:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would store it on an svn
[06/12/2007 02:07:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i delete documents if they are not organized properly
[06/12/2007 02:07:39 PM] Robert Douglas: you shouldnt *need* it to keep track of documents we send out
[06/12/2007 02:07:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i know in the past you've lost some contract/proposal things i've sent
[06/12/2007 02:07:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand that statement
[06/12/2007 02:08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: at least we're going to roll out with svn so we wont run into this problem
[06/12/2007 02:08:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wasn't even a final version
[06/12/2007 02:09:20 PM] Robert Douglas: shouldn't matter
[06/12/2007 02:09:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok how about you do what you need to, and i'll do what i need to
[06/12/2007 02:09:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want to send me the final version the client agreed on?
[06/12/2007 02:09:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: or did you lose it too?
[06/12/2007 02:10:01 PM] Robert Douglas: it was the one i already sent over, i'll have to get it when i get back
[06/12/2007 02:10:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont lose documents like that, i save everything in a very nice organizatal way
[06/12/2007 02:10:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: give me a minute and a please and i might check my email for you
[06/12/2007 02:10:48 PM] Robert Douglas: please can you try to find that file i sent
[06/12/2007 02:10:53 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it was over MSN, not email
[06/12/2007 02:11:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah must have been over msn
[06/12/2007 02:15:05 PM] Robert Douglas: k, np, let me check with alex
[06/12/2007 02:15:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i can't RD into my machine at hom ebecause it is on my apartment's wirelss network
[06/12/2007 02:15:29 PM] Robert Douglas: and i dont have access to the router to setup port forwarding for RD
[06/12/2007 02:17:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: good thing i'll have the svn up soon
[06/12/2007 02:17:56 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, alex has it on his comp
[06/12/2007 02:18:07 PM] Robert Douglas: even though i never said it was "final version", he still knew to save it
[06/12/2007 02:18:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i would have saved it to if i had a good place to put it
[06/12/2007 02:18:55 PM] Robert Douglas: you know how to make a new folder to store it, you dont need an SVN to save a document someone sends you
[06/12/2007 02:19:05 PM] Robert Douglas: alex isn't even going to do anything with it, yet he still knew to save it
[06/12/2007 02:20:21 PM] Robert Douglas: conversations like this make me want to work with you less and less, just keep that in mind
[06/12/2007 02:20:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok what is your point by telling me alex kept a document you can't get access to?
[06/12/2007 02:20:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah believe me i feel the same way about you
[06/12/2007 02:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: except i am more understanding and have an open mind, everything has to be an argument with you
[06/12/2007 02:21:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm saying that you shouldn't need SVN in order to know to save a file, you've lost tons of files in the past that i sent over, and once again, you don't have this
[06/12/2007 02:21:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not my responsibility
[06/12/2007 02:22:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was actually the first project spec you sent me
[06/12/2007 02:22:04 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, if you want to only be a programmer, you're on the right track
[06/12/2007 02:22:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of just bits of pieces and long arguments over msn
[06/12/2007 02:22:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i guess it depends what you want to do and wher eyou want to be with the company
[06/12/2007 02:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're in CA with your own job, where are you with the company?
[06/12/2007 02:24:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i try to make progress, you just want to argue
[06/12/2007 02:25:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont really know what else to say right now
[06/12/2007 02:25:09 PM] Robert Douglas: but hold off on this until i have a talk with alex
[06/12/2007 02:25:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: keep track of your shit so this doesn't happen again, i haven't even started on phase 2, there is no reason for me to have the project spec yet
[06/12/2007 02:25:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i know where my stuff is at... i said earlier that it isn't lost, i just dont have access to it
[06/12/2007 02:25:55 PM] Robert Douglas: nowhere did imply i didnt know where it was at

[06/13/2007 02:56:11 PM] Robert Douglas: that sucks, i keep a daily FF backup now
[06/13/2007 02:56:14 PM] Robert Douglas: so whenever something happens, i can restore my entire FF
[06/13/2007 02:56:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah this shit is pissing me off
[06/13/2007 02:56:43 PM] Robert Douglas: whenever i go on a new computer, i can restore one of my backups on that comp, and it is as if it was just like i was on my desktop, no matter the comp i am on
[06/13/2007 02:57:44 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and myself have a noon meeting (our timezone, not his) on friday to go over some marketing information for a current client, if you're interested in it, you're invited to the meeting

[06/13/2007 10:11:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i get what?
[06/13/2007 10:11:17 PM] Robert Douglas: most of that
[06/13/2007 10:11:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: just in time, alex and i are finishing up nyb now
[06/13/2007 10:11:35 PM] Robert Douglas: nice, nyb is coming out very good
[06/13/2007 10:11:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: which means i'll have all weekend to work on it
[06/13/2007 10:11:57 PM] Robert Douglas: for the home page (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/)http://www.jambonie.com/
[06/13/2007 10:12:02 PM] Robert Douglas: the flash is now inside an iframe
[06/13/2007 10:12:29 PM] Robert Douglas: and i'm going to modify the swf so that it will redirect that iframe to this page (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/small_frame_flash.php)http://www.jambonie.com/small_frame_flash.php
[06/13/2007 10:12:40 PM] Robert Douglas: so that once the video is done, it will start to play that flash video
[06/13/2007 10:13:21 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: www.jambonie.com/small_frame_video.php)www.jambonie.com/small_frame_video.php
[06/13/2007 10:13:28 PM] Robert Douglas: video in the name, not flash
[06/13/2007 10:14:32 PM] Robert Douglas: do you have a better suggestion to accomplish what i want? other than doing an iframe and having the flash video refresh that frame to a new page?
[06/13/2007 10:14:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait i'm a little confused
[06/13/2007 10:15:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want the flash to play after the page is loaded?
[06/13/2007 10:15:37 PM] Robert Douglas: You visit home page, click the play button, then once cartoon is done playing, it will display a video instead of the cartoon.
[06/13/2007 10:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: a video instead? like in our player?
[06/13/2007 10:16:43 PM] *** You have been disconnected. Wed Jun 13 22:16:43 2007.
[06/13/2007 10:18:19 PM] *** "Robert Douglas" signed on at Wed Jun 13 22:18:19 2007.
[06/13/2007 10:19:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: a video instead? like in our player?
[06/13/2007 10:19:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: the site is angry at me
[06/13/2007 10:20:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could use dhtml
[06/13/2007 10:20:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: why not just change the content of the "frame" and put it inside a div?
[06/13/2007 10:21:15 PM] Robert Douglas: you think you could write some ajax for htat?
[06/13/2007 10:21:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you won't need ajax
[06/13/2007 10:21:32 PM] Robert Douglas: it would have to work for flash though
[06/13/2007 10:21:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so flash plays then it changes to a video?
[06/13/2007 10:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: any specific video?
[06/13/2007 10:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: in our player?
[06/13/2007 10:21:58 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/small_frame_flash.php)http://www.jambonie.com/small_frame_flash.php
[06/13/2007 10:21:59 PM] Robert Douglas: tghat one
[06/13/2007 10:22:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: shit i got to get those single files working
[06/13/2007 10:24:13 PM] Robert Douglas: refresh the homepage
[06/13/2007 10:24:18 PM] Robert Douglas: and then click the go to top
[06/13/2007 10:24:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool
[06/13/2007 10:25:06 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the idea i kinda have
[06/13/2007 10:25:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can see that working without the iframe though
[06/13/2007 10:25:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: iframes are really standard
[06/13/2007 10:44:57 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/)http://www.jambonie.com/
[06/13/2007 10:44:59 PM] Robert Douglas: done
[06/13/2007 10:56:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: its still an iframe
[06/13/2007 10:57:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so lets let bigods be bigods
[06/13/2007 10:57:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/13/2007 10:57:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you get the project spec from alex?
[06/13/2007 10:57:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm heading to bed so i can get up earlier tom
[06/13/2007 10:57:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: just a sec
[06/13/2007 10:57:24 PM] Robert Douglas: the phase 2? yeah he sent it over
[06/13/2007 10:58:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: will you send me the document later, so i can see the calendar and think about the future parts?
[06/13/2007 10:58:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd like to plug away at it this weekend
[06/13/2007 10:58:21 PM] *** Robert Douglas is trying to send you "Jambonie Phase II.doc"
[06/13/2007 10:58:57 PM] Robert Douglas: that's it
[06/13/2007 10:59:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to go to bed, i'm geting upreally early
[06/13/2007 10:59:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and later we can talk about when to allocate time for making the upload sexier
[06/13/2007 10:59:16 PM] Robert Douglas: that file is missing 1 other thing, but that other thing is really close 2 the  band calendar
[06/13/2007 10:59:23 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[06/13/2007 10:59:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok ttyl
[06/13/2007 10:59:29 PM] Robert Douglas: there are some other bugs too we need to talk about
[06/13/2007 10:59:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[06/13/2007 10:59:32 PM] Robert Douglas: one thing on server level i think
[06/13/2007 10:59:42 PM] Robert Douglas: but thx for the work, we'll chat tomorrow
[06/13/2007 10:59:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok ttyl

[06/14/2007 12:33:01 PM] Robert Douglas: hey
[06/14/2007 12:33:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: you get my message?
[06/14/2007 12:33:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry just realized i wasn't signed on
[06/14/2007 12:33:32 PM] Robert Douglas: yeha, i called you back but didnt get an answer
[06/14/2007 12:33:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had a few questions, we want to get this calendar done soon, but when do you want to work on the rest of phase two?
[06/14/2007 12:33:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i have next week free?
[06/14/2007 12:33:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i told them when they are ready and have money in our account, we'll get started on a case by case basis
[06/14/2007 12:33:59 PM] Robert Douglas: they tell us they will be rdy soon
[06/14/2007 12:34:03 PM] Robert Douglas: then i relay that to you
[06/14/2007 12:34:06 PM] Robert Douglas: then they put money in account
[06/14/2007 12:34:12 PM] Robert Douglas: then i tell u that we r rdy to start
[06/14/2007 12:34:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool, so we are just doing the events right now?
[06/14/2007 12:34:43 PM] Robert Douglas: just the band calendar
[06/14/2007 12:34:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/14/2007 12:34:56 PM] Robert Douglas: then we'll work that into an event thing, but the event thing will have an image upload component tied to it
[06/14/2007 12:35:04 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, do you have the jambonie cpanel password handy
[06/14/2007 12:35:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, cool, however i would like to throw in some extra work on things that need improvement
[06/14/2007 12:35:25 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, there are a couple things i want to talk to you about
[06/14/2007 12:35:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to log into their cpanel, but in order to do that i need to put up this proxy page, but in order to set that up, i need to create a sub domain in their cpanel
[06/14/2007 12:36:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: iKstFKTcxoM8jf33
[06/14/2007 12:36:03 PM] Robert Douglas: although i might be able to do it from their WHM, but either way i neeed the cpanel login first... it will also be the same password that is used for their main account
[06/14/2007 12:36:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: iKstFKTcxoM8jf33
[06/14/2007 12:36:15 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome thx
[06/14/2007 12:37:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so, on my own time between calendar and next parts of phase 2, i'd like to implement a better dialog box for the messages, i am going to use the yahoo UI dialogs, they are compliant and work in every browser
[06/14/2007 12:37:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and finally, i am going to better organize some functions in the common.php file, shouldn't take me long, and just for programming sake it needs to be split up a bit
[06/14/2007 12:37:55 PM] Robert Douglas: can you go to (Link: http://jambonie.com/cpanel)http://jambonie.com/cpanel user=jambonie pass=iKstFKTcxoM8jf33 and then click Sub Domains, and create cpanel.jambonie.com (have it setup for folder /cpanel) - it should make sense once you log in
[06/14/2007 12:38:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: now you said they was a problem with server side stuff?
[06/14/2007 12:38:13 PM] Robert Douglas: ok that's cool, i think both of us need to have a short convo about the future plans with jambonie
[06/14/2007 12:38:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i believe so, if you can make that sub domain for me, and then i need 5 mins to do some minor work, i'll have some time to get up 2 date with it all
[06/14/2007 12:39:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made the subdomain
[06/14/2007 12:40:02 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome thx
[06/14/2007 12:40:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i set up a cpanel/whm proxy
[06/14/2007 12:40:45 PM] Robert Douglas: so that you can access it over port 80
[06/14/2007 12:43:10 PM] Robert Douglas: ahhh, phpmyadmin is messing up on me
[06/14/2007 12:43:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[06/14/2007 12:44:53 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie cpanel > phpmyadmin > open main database > open user table > browse table > open ID 157 (gary roberts)
[06/14/2007 12:45:26 PM] Robert Douglas: try to update his confirmation code textarea to be 1 (so he is enabled), and then i get shot back with:

[06/14/2007 12:46:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: worked for me
[06/14/2007 12:46:49 PM] Robert Douglas: k, it must have something to do with logging in via the proxy

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Robert Douglas): Thu Jun 14 13:11:37 2007
[06/14/2007 01:11:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so about 150 members now
[06/14/2007 01:12:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: we take the autofill on the confirm code off?
[06/14/2007 01:20:12 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we can do that now
[06/14/2007 01:20:19 PM] Robert Douglas: that's one thing i want to discuss with you
[06/14/2007 01:20:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 01:20:35 PM] Robert Douglas: because a LONG code is really annoying to type, and not everyone is able to just copy it over, we have stupid viewers
[06/14/2007 01:20:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/14/2007 01:20:51 PM] Robert Douglas: so i am thinking that we should get a list of possibly 50-100 short words, and call it "Confirmation Word"
[06/14/2007 01:20:59 PM] Robert Douglas: like "Hello" or "Pizza"
[06/14/2007 01:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i agree
[06/14/2007 01:21:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll come up with the list
[06/14/2007 01:21:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: mix in a few numbers
[06/14/2007 01:21:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: just download one
[06/14/2007 01:21:35 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what i will do, so dont worry about that part
[06/14/2007 01:21:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 01:22:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll work on the calendar
[06/14/2007 01:22:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: didn't we start to implement it?
[06/14/2007 01:22:29 PM] Robert Douglas: you did a little work with it i think, basically just got things rdy 2 go for when we did it, but i wrote up all of the template files to be used
[06/14/2007 01:23:01 PM] Robert Douglas: there are calendaredit.php and calendarview.php pages
[06/14/2007 01:23:07 PM] Robert Douglas: in the public_html
[06/14/2007 01:23:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool
[06/14/2007 01:23:15 PM] Robert Douglas: but those arent the template pages
[06/14/2007 01:23:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i think i put the template up on rps' site
[06/14/2007 01:23:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like i still have them all
[06/14/2007 01:23:33 PM] Robert Douglas: let me login to verify the template
[06/14/2007 01:23:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got the template files too
[06/14/2007 01:23:43 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool, then i wont bother trying to find them
[06/14/2007 01:24:09 PM] Robert Douglas: so you should be good 2 go with the band calendar
[06/14/2007 01:24:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like i got calendar edit almost completely written up
[06/14/2007 01:24:27 PM] Robert Douglas: nice :)
[06/14/2007 01:24:36 PM] Robert Douglas: there are some issues with long usernames/band names
[06/14/2007 01:24:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: site wide or a specific section?
[06/14/2007 01:24:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should cap the length?
[06/14/2007 01:25:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that what is missing?
[06/14/2007 01:25:10 PM] Robert Douglas: two things I think are missing
[06/14/2007 01:25:30 PM] Robert Douglas: the main thing is a display issue 
- (Link: www.jambonie.com)www.jambonie.com | the user/band name needs to be truncated
[06/14/2007 01:25:39 PM] Robert Douglas: add  style="overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap;"
[06/14/2007 01:26:06 PM] Robert Douglas: the next issue is that we should limit the band/user names to be a certain length in characters
[06/14/2007 01:26:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i see it
[06/14/2007 01:28:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so maybe no truncating so far, we will do the nowrap, and limit the length to 15?
[06/14/2007 01:28:45 PM] Robert Douglas: 15 might work, that's run with that and see if it fixes it, if not, we can just change it down 1 by 1 until we find something that does work
[06/14/2007 01:30:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: stars still need improvment
[06/14/2007 01:30:23 PM] Robert Douglas: also, what i was saying about the issue (possibly with the server) is that when you are downloading a video, you can click on any other links until the video downloads completely
[06/14/2007 01:30:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i think this has something to do with the lack of streaming support on the server, something i believe i need to take up with the admins
[06/14/2007 01:31:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i think 15 is too high, can we try 10?
[06/14/2007 01:31:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: so by downloading you mean viewing in the player?
[06/14/2007 01:31:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i haven't fixed it yet
[06/14/2007 01:31:49 PM] Robert Douglas: when you are viewing the player, it is downloading the entire video, and during that process, you cant always click out to another page
[06/14/2007 01:32:33 PM] Robert Douglas: the band conchpartyband is too long, and causes the date to be on the next line below, so we need to have it a couple less than that, i think 10 is a good number to start with
[06/14/2007 01:32:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok thats just the nowrap
[06/14/2007 01:32:49 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/14/2007 01:32:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i truncate for now?
[06/14/2007 01:33:13 PM] Robert Douglas: do what you did to the song name
[06/14/2007 01:33:21 PM] Robert Douglas: we want to basically hide whatever doesnt fit
[06/14/2007 01:33:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i'll do something nice for you
[06/14/2007 01:34:12 PM] Robert Douglas: thanks, if you look at what you did for the Longer than You Thought name that is under the current top 10, that's the exact thing i think we want to do
[06/14/2007 01:34:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: well all the text is hiding now
[06/14/2007 01:34:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: 3. on the right
[06/14/2007 01:35:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we should include a ...
[06/14/2007 01:35:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, you're right, we need a ... i think
[06/14/2007 01:35:40 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe in the display, have it check for the length, and then truncate the output for the display, but not for the link
[06/14/2007 01:35:48 PM] Robert Douglas: and add ... to the end if it is greater than the max length
[06/14/2007 01:36:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i'mma do something hot
[06/14/2007 01:37:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: first it will check length for songs and names, like 10-15 characters long, then it will check for a last space before that, but it will only truncate it on the space if it is less then 20% characters away from the max length
[06/14/2007 01:38:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you understand, its gonna be sexy
[06/14/2007 01:38:13 PM] Robert Douglas: very nice
[06/14/2007 01:38:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so 1. will be Longer then You..., but PaperShasinRecord... 
[06/14/2007 01:38:32 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds like a more robust implementation of what i asked for, thus runnning into less problems for the future, i like it
[06/14/2007 01:39:25 PM] Robert Douglas: there are things that i would expect a programmer manager to tell the programmer to do, as opposed to expecting the programmer to figure it out himself, so it's good that you thought about what was going on, and then coming up with a better implementation, i like it
[06/14/2007 01:40:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks, i guess i don't have to let you know every little addition to fixes, but i think this will work out really cool
[06/14/2007 01:41:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it's good that you tell me these things
[06/14/2007 01:41:50 PM] Robert Douglas: instead of just doing it the way i laid out, you thought about it, and came up with a better solution
[06/14/2007 01:41:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should work on replacing the in-code text with constants 
[06/14/2007 01:42:24 PM] Robert Douglas: in the future though, you should say "I have a better idea, and it is this, what do you think?" and then proceede, but at least it was good that you came up with something that is gunna work to be more robust
[06/14/2007 01:42:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 01:42:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think we're at that stage yet with "we should work on replacing the in-code text with constants " i think in another week or so we'll discuss some of the jambonie cleanup
[06/14/2007 01:42:55 PM] Robert Douglas: and we can include that in the discussion
[06/14/2007 01:43:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 01:46:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we should record jambonie inside of sugar
[06/14/2007 01:46:41 PM] Robert Douglas: and the jambonie calendar should be a task (that I create at the jambonie PM)
[06/14/2007 01:47:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be cool

[06/14/2007 02:25:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: longer than you
[06/14/2007 02:25:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and 8. so much more...
[06/14/2007 02:25:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: different lengths but truncates hot
[06/14/2007 02:32:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i set up the band calendar as a task for you, you will want to review the parent task to get an overview of what is to be done
[06/14/2007 02:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 02:33:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i think under the So Much More..., you should be able tos ee more
[06/14/2007 02:33:36 PM] Robert Douglas: or is your logic to only display the next word, if X % of that word can display?
[06/14/2007 02:34:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: it has to be less then 4 characters away for it to cut off the partial word
[06/14/2007 02:34:14 PM] Robert Douglas: why 4?
[06/14/2007 02:34:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: close to 20% of 15
[06/14/2007 02:34:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i think the algo might need to be updated
[06/14/2007 02:34:45 PM] Robert Douglas: look at So Much More
[06/14/2007 02:34:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it should display So Much More He...
[06/14/2007 02:34:59 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[06/14/2007 02:35:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: it cut off the even word
[06/14/2007 02:35:29 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm, maybe it looks better to see it the way it is
[06/14/2007 02:35:40 PM] Robert Douglas: let's leave it like that, and then i'll follow up with the client to see what he thinks
[06/14/2007 02:35:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/14/2007 02:36:04 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure if you're done yet, but the right side of (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/index.php)http://www.jambonie.com/index.php under PaperChassinRecor... you will see that the date is pushed to the right
[06/14/2007 02:36:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i have to add a truncate to the username below the title
[06/14/2007 02:36:59 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[06/14/2007 02:37:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i also think we should limit the username to a certain amount of characters
[06/14/2007 02:37:32 PM] Robert Douglas: conchpartyband=14 and pushes the date too far to the right
[06/14/2007 02:37:46 PM] Robert Douglas: thinking that 13 should be the max
[06/14/2007 02:38:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah looks like 12 just works
[06/14/2007 02:41:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok we need an edit event
[06/14/2007 02:41:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: for the calendar
[06/14/2007 02:42:53 PM] Robert Douglas: sec

[06/14/2007 02:53:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: kristen bell is the perfect woman
[06/14/2007 02:59:16 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/14/2007 02:59:47 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to change "Latin" to "Latino"
[06/14/2007 02:59:48 PM] Robert Douglas: but i can do it later
[06/14/2007 03:08:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: women generally annoy me
[06/14/2007 03:16:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: find a woman that has a hobby, and doesn't ask me what i'm thinking about every 5 minutes and i'll be interested
[06/14/2007 03:39:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the event add works

[06/17/2007 08:45:06 PM] Robert Douglas: call my 254 9295 number in the future, my 9218 is gpoing to be completely personal now
[06/17/2007 08:45:11 PM] Robert Douglas: and plus, that 9218 number blows
[06/17/2007 08:45:13 PM] Robert Douglas: the phone sucks
[06/17/2007 08:45:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i told alex to stop calling the 9218, but havent told u about my shity cell phone yet

[06/17/2007 08:45:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: will do
[06/17/2007 08:51:27 PM] Robert Douglas: no worries, i didnt tell u about it until now lol
[06/17/2007 08:51:33 PM] Robert Douglas: that upload shit sounds good
[06/17/2007 08:51:38 PM] Robert Douglas: but have you ifnished the band calendar
[06/17/2007 08:52:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think so
[06/17/2007 08:52:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: needs testing
[06/17/2007 08:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: prints out ok
[06/17/2007 08:52:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i think there should only be 1 top song/video
[06/17/2007 08:52:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: since most the videos are actually songs
[06/17/2007 08:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: or music videos
[06/17/2007 08:52:36 PM] Robert Douglas: we have top music videos
[06/17/2007 08:52:39 PM] Robert Douglas: and then top songs
[06/17/2007 08:52:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we should ask the client
[06/17/2007 08:52:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: there should only be 1 top is my proposal
[06/17/2007 08:53:05 PM] Robert Douglas: the edit calendar link should only appear when u are logged in
[06/17/2007 08:53:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i will fix that
[06/17/2007 08:53:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but can we ask the client about the top media?
[06/17/2007 08:53:30 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i'll give them a call then
[06/17/2007 08:55:12 PM] Robert Douglas: the subscribe to calendar thing should be done too
[06/17/2007 08:55:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to talk to u a bit about azrn later
[06/17/2007 08:55:41 PM] Robert Douglas: u gunna be around by 10:30pm tonght?
[06/17/2007 08:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably not
[06/17/2007 08:56:03 PM] Robert Douglas: k, then let's chat about it tomorrow
[06/17/2007 08:56:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/php/upload.php)http://www.jambonie.com/php/upload.php
[06/17/2007 08:56:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but check out that script
[06/17/2007 08:56:58 PM] Robert Douglas: since u have the % thing on it
[06/17/2007 08:57:09 PM] Robert Douglas: you should be easily able to make it a bar
[06/17/2007 08:57:15 PM] Robert Douglas: that would rock
[06/17/2007 08:57:19 PM] Robert Douglas: very nice so far man
[06/17/2007 08:57:33 PM] Robert Douglas: once u finish the band calendar, they gunna pay us for the next step
[06/17/2007 08:58:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so we need an rss feed type thing?
[06/17/2007 08:58:11 PM] Robert Douglas: not right now
[06/17/2007 08:58:15 PM] Robert Douglas: next step is an event calendar
[06/17/2007 08:58:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: send emails when its updated?
[06/17/2007 08:58:23 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[06/17/2007 08:58:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i mean
[06/17/2007 08:58:40 PM] Robert Douglas: whenever a new event is posted, it will automatically send out an email
[06/17/2007 08:58:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i'll start on the cron script
[06/17/2007 09:00:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we should really take into consideration sprucing up the email messages, it wouldn't be hard to do, and it would really make a difference 
[06/17/2007 09:00:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: now do my fucking math homework for me
[06/17/2007 09:00:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it would be a good idea to have all e-mails go through a jambonie email parser
[06/17/2007 09:01:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: exacly
[06/17/2007 09:01:12 PM] Robert Douglas: so instead of sending out an email right away, it will just send it to the parser
[06/17/2007 09:01:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be soo easy to do
[06/17/2007 09:01:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it is overkill for right now
[06/17/2007 09:01:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/17/2007 09:01:26 PM] Robert Douglas: but it is good 2 plan ahead
[06/17/2007 09:01:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i would rather c u spend ur time on other shit for the site
[06/17/2007 09:01:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: but all we would need is a little page, like a copy of main, and parse that as the output for the email
[06/17/2007 09:02:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: but yeah, future
[06/17/2007 09:02:31 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta run
[06/17/2007 09:02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: be back around 1030, or talk 2 u tomorrow
Session Close (Robert Douglas): Sun Jun 17 21:23:30 2007


Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Robert Douglas): Mon Jun 18 10:42:05 2007
[06/18/2007 10:42:05 AM] Robert Douglas: y0
[06/18/2007 11:37:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: hey
[06/18/2007 11:37:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: you test calendar?
[06/18/2007 11:38:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: or band events
[06/18/2007 11:38:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e you call it
[06/18/2007 11:38:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will work on the sign up thing today
[06/18/2007 11:43:33 AM] Robert Douglas: the edit calendar thing still displays for me
[06/18/2007 11:44:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah didn't work on it at all
[06/18/2007 11:44:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but why do we even need that link there if it will be on the right?
[06/18/2007 11:44:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: why not just have the view calendar
[06/18/2007 11:44:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[06/18/2007 11:44:35 AM] Robert Douglas: good point
[06/18/2007 11:44:41 AM] Robert Douglas: let's just remove it then
[06/18/2007 11:44:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: k
[06/18/2007 11:44:56 AM] Robert Douglas: here's an idea about the display portion... maybe have it setup to display 2 months worth of calendar data, and then have a (View previous calendar) link to see the old data
[06/18/2007 11:45:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: and how about printing out a limited list of events underneath the add event page?
[06/18/2007 11:45:06 AM] Robert Douglas: then at some point, we will decide what to do with the old calendar data
[06/18/2007 11:45:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would work
[06/18/2007 11:45:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i could even have it go through the current search page, and just do some mode rewrites
[06/18/2007 11:45:42 AM] Robert Douglas: for the add event page, you could have it display the current 2 month's worth of info
[06/18/2007 11:45:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: eventually when we add on a full search that will make it easy
[06/18/2007 11:46:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: for a user to search events
[06/18/2007 11:46:22 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/18/2007 11:46:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need to add multiple page support for the search anyways
[06/18/2007 11:46:43 AM] Robert Douglas: so on the add event page, have it display the current events up to 2 months (so the current month, and then the next month)
[06/18/2007 11:46:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know what else would be cool, if i go ahead and spruce up the band list css, like we talked about before
[06/18/2007 11:47:14 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i'm going to come up with a new display for that later, dont worry about it right now
[06/18/2007 11:47:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/18/2007 11:47:53 AM] Robert Douglas: lets just get the calendar working 100% so we can move on to the next thing
[06/18/2007 11:48:15 AM] Robert Douglas: this next phase is going to be done in a step by step basis, so our focus is always going to be the project at hand, as opposed to the overall site in general
[06/18/2007 11:48:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/18/2007 11:49:55 AM] Robert Douglas: once the calendar is done, if you want, u can add a nice little javascript calendar month popup, where someone can view an actual calendar, and then select a date and have the form automatically populated
[06/18/2007 11:50:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i am thinking if they are logged in they can ajax (add edit, delete) events
[06/18/2007 11:51:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: on the view calendar page
[06/18/2007 11:51:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: then i am going back to working on the ajax upload hotness
[06/18/2007 11:51:55 AM] Robert Douglas: nice
[06/18/2007 11:51:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: just in between features to implement
[06/18/2007 11:52:05 AM] Robert Douglas: let me know when the calendar is done, before you work on the sexy upload script
[06/18/2007 11:52:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need to get the ajax for the conversion worked out, then i think we will be ready to implement that too
[06/18/2007 11:52:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.yui-ext.com/deploy/yui-ext/docs/)http://www.yui-ext.com/deploy/yui-ext/docs/
[06/18/2007 11:52:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: click dialogs
[06/18/2007 11:52:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: and hello world
[06/18/2007 11:53:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: then click the button Hello WOrld
[06/18/2007 11:53:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats the dialog i am going to implement for error messages
[06/18/2007 11:53:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: instead of the crappy on we have now
[06/18/2007 11:53:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: and a fade in for the dark background would be nice too on the dialog
[06/18/2007 11:54:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: but this is all future stuff
[06/18/2007 11:54:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will work on calendar now
[06/18/2007 11:54:34 AM] Robert Douglas: very nice find with the ajax
[06/18/2007 11:54:43 AM] Robert Douglas: i honestly think this web 2.0 shit will be jambonie's future
[06/18/2007 11:55:00 AM] Robert Douglas: plus, it is very very good practice for you, becuase you're getting into this new stuff at such a young age
[06/18/2007 11:55:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/18/2007 11:55:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: this site is going to be so hot
[06/18/2007 11:56:07 AM] Robert Douglas: oh yeah
[06/18/2007 11:56:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: i really need to pick apart and analyze what should have ajax, there are a few inconsistencies
[06/18/2007 11:57:14 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but we need to keep in mind that everytime new ajax is implemented, it needs to be tested in FF, IE6/7, Netscape, and Opera
[06/18/2007 11:57:28 AM] Robert Douglas: because we dont want to implement a new system, and then have user reports of all these issues
[06/18/2007 11:57:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, did we ever figure out if it works in netscape at all?
[06/18/2007 11:58:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: it works in ie 6 mostly
[06/18/2007 11:58:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude there are so many bands signed up
[06/18/2007 11:58:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: 4 in the last week
[06/18/2007 11:59:46 AM] Robert Douglas: netscape worked i think
[06/18/2007 11:59:52 AM] Robert Douglas: i think opera had an issue, but i forgot
[06/18/2007 12:00:12 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be 100% in IE6/7, and FF
[06/18/2007 12:00:38 PM] Robert Douglas: if you see something working in FF, but not in IE6/7 100%, it needs to be treated as broken in all browsers, and fixed
[06/18/2007 12:00:52 PM] Robert Douglas: even though we use FF, the majority of our users do not
[06/18/2007 12:02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: is that site yui-ext using extensions from yahoo to create these boxes and such?
[06/18/2007 12:26:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: its an extension to the yahoo api
[06/18/2007 12:27:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it doesn't actually download anything from yahoo, all the resources can be refered to on a local server
[06/18/2007 12:27:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: he provides multiple templates for it too
[06/18/2007 12:28:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so my plan is to just copy the dialog code and the css code that it actually uses, and modify it to match jambonie's theme
[06/18/2007 12:28:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but its also compliant
[06/18/2007 12:28:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: xhtml too i think
[06/18/2007 12:28:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and multi browser compatible
[06/18/2007 12:30:20 PM] Robert Douglas: it would rock if we had that implemented
[06/18/2007 12:30:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we should change the registration around to use a bunch of nice images and such too
[06/18/2007 12:30:36 PM] Robert Douglas: but that's another step later on
[06/18/2007 12:31:14 PM] Robert Douglas: in the next week or 2, we're going to have to discuss a way to establish a development system for jambonie
[06/18/2007 12:31:45 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, we will roll out changes to our dev code
[06/18/2007 12:31:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and then apply them sitewide
[06/18/2007 12:34:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/18/2007 12:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: that dialog will be nice, but its last on my list
[06/18/2007 12:34:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: out of 10
[06/18/2007 12:35:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we should also modify the band contact information
[06/18/2007 12:36:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: its slightly confusing and users end up putting stuff in like "Contact jameskingcrew via: Contact Jamesking Crew via: info@jameskingcrew.com"
[06/18/2007 12:36:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should have a place for e-mail address so we can anti spam it, and a place for phone number, and a place for other, then it will format the output based on what is filled in
[06/18/2007 12:37:49 PM] Robert Douglas: interesting
[06/18/2007 12:38:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: because right now it kind of acts like a "put whatever here " field, and can be confusing
[06/18/2007 12:38:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we supply suggested fields, the user will know what we expect
[06/18/2007 12:40:39 PM] Robert Douglas: when an album is deleted, do the songs/mp3s get removed from the server?
[06/18/2007 12:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/18/2007 12:41:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but let me verify
[06/18/2007 12:42:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes all the files are removed and the songs in the database are removed
[06/18/2007 12:44:44 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[06/18/2007 12:46:43 PM] Robert Douglas: sooner or later, i would like to see the entire site using those nice popup dialog windows
[06/18/2007 12:46:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah those are going to be excellent
[06/18/2007 12:46:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: soon
[06/18/2007 12:47:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will try to get through this whole list today
[06/18/2007 12:47:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and do the dialog tonight or tomorrow
[06/18/2007 12:53:00 PM] Robert Douglas: are you working on include/settings.php?
[06/18/2007 12:53:26 PM] Robert Douglas: also says you checked out some css files too
[06/18/2007 12:53:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to change "Latin" to "Latino"
[06/18/2007 12:54:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: go ahead
[06/18/2007 12:54:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: not using that one
[06/18/2007 12:57:21 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, Latino is too long lol
[06/18/2007 01:26:07 PM] Robert Douglas: top 10/top3 is dead again ahhhhhhhh
[06/18/2007 01:26:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to grab some lunch
[06/18/2007 01:27:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know i fucked it up
[06/18/2007 01:27:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: give me some time
[06/18/2007 01:47:14 PM] Robert Douglas: k np
[06/18/2007 01:50:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: question, is global.css supposed to be double spaced?
[06/18/2007 01:50:49 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[06/18/2007 01:50:53 PM] Robert Douglas: DW does that crap sometimes
[06/18/2007 01:51:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do i fix it?
[06/18/2007 01:51:33 PM] Robert Douglas: manuall delete each line lol
[06/18/2007 01:51:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[06/18/2007 01:54:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: or find an replace
[06/18/2007 01:54:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i did a macro
[06/18/2007 01:54:27 PM] Robert Douglas: that deleted each line
[06/18/2007 01:54:28 PM] Robert Douglas: heh
[06/18/2007 01:54:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: find and replace worked
[06/18/2007 01:54:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck yes
[06/18/2007 01:54:58 PM] Robert Douglas: w00000t

[06/18/2007 10:33:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to look at the problems
[06/18/2007 10:33:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: rolling it back to a previous version helps nothing
[06/18/2007 10:33:43 PM] Robert Douglas: if you open it in IE6, you will see the issue right away
[06/18/2007 10:33:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok well give me a minute
[06/18/2007 10:33:53 PM] Robert Douglas: it just produces a black page
[06/18/2007 10:34:20 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, if u have time to fix it right now, then i'll wait, but if not, we gotta roll it back, and then tomorrow hwne u have time, we'll roll it to the new stuff u did, then u can fix the issue
[06/18/2007 10:35:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine, give me a minute

[06/18/2007 10:43:05 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea what the porblem is with it? 

[06/18/2007 10:43:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: something wrong with the new dialog box
[06/18/2007 10:45:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: fixed
[06/18/2007 10:45:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but my opinion of ie6 users still stands
[06/18/2007 10:47:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: new dialog box needs some work, but its nothing to keep someone from using the site
[06/18/2007 10:48:22 PM] Robert Douglas: ie6 wouldnt even load
[06/18/2007 10:48:28 PM] Robert Douglas: and that's about 80% of our visitors
[06/18/2007 10:48:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was loading it was just being covered up
[06/18/2007 10:48:55 PM] Robert Douglas: u know what i mean
[06/18/2007 10:48:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should work on your debugging terminology
[06/18/2007 10:49:13 PM] Robert Douglas: it wouldnt load it correctly
[06/18/2007 10:49:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i didn't know what you meant until i looked at it, right as you were about to roll it back
[06/18/2007 10:49:35 PM] Robert Douglas: in the future, will you please look at it in IE6/7/FF?
[06/18/2007 10:49:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will
[06/18/2007 10:50:04 PM] Robert Douglas: k thx
[06/18/2007 10:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but ie7 is a required update for windows, tell the users to not be so fucking stupid
[06/18/2007 10:50:22 PM] Robert Douglas: not everyone can update it
[06/18/2007 10:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: it they have internet access they can update
[06/18/2007 10:50:36 PM] Robert Douglas: u gotta understand the real world results, and that is t hat very few people have IE7
[06/18/2007 10:50:44 PM] Robert Douglas: they might not be able to download the updates
[06/18/2007 10:50:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if they are using jambonie, they must have internet access
[06/18/2007 10:50:58 PM] Robert Douglas: lots of comptuers at work require specific user rights in order to install updates
[06/18/2007 10:51:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: very few people should be allowed to use a computer
[06/18/2007 10:51:15 PM] Robert Douglas: IE6 is HUGE, to forget about them, we would be losing on a lot of market
[06/18/2007 10:51:34 PM] Robert Douglas: thhx for fixing the issue
[06/18/2007 10:51:36 PM] Robert Douglas: gl with math
[06/18/2007 10:51:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm heading off to bed
[06/18/2007 10:51:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: gn

[06/19/2007 01:02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: still here?
[06/19/2007 01:04:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: ya
[06/19/2007 01:05:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[06/19/2007 01:05:13 PM] Robert Douglas: azrn questions
[06/19/2007 01:05:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/19/2007 01:05:52 PM] Robert Douglas: when is the day that the renewal email goes out? Is it July 31?
[06/19/2007 01:06:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: its 30 days before expiration
[06/19/2007 01:06:39 PM] Robert Douglas: what test did you do to make sure your implementation works?
[06/19/2007 01:07:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i manually set my expiration 30 days ahead on when i was working on it and i got an e-mail
[06/19/2007 01:07:26 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[06/19/2007 01:07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: also, when someone tries to renew, the system doesn't update the member in the DB, instead, it adds a new member
[06/19/2007 01:08:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only time it would do that is if they filled out the registration info again
[06/19/2007 01:08:17 PM] Robert Douglas: how do they renew?
[06/19/2007 01:09:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: Renew.php
[06/19/2007 01:09:15 PM] Robert Douglas: so they fill that form out?
[06/19/2007 01:09:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is a form, but its just for the button
[06/19/2007 01:09:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: the signup redirects to that page
[06/19/2007 01:09:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: they click the button and go to paypal
[06/19/2007 01:09:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: then paypal returns them to the Details.php page
[06/19/2007 01:10:03 PM] Robert Douglas: can you list the steps, 1, 2, 3, etc... that might make more sense i think
[06/19/2007 01:10:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: the one you wanted to modify
[06/19/2007 01:11:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: 1. the sign up, 2. they go to renew.php, 3. they click button and fill out paypal stuff, 4. they are returned by paypal to Details.php, 5. their account expires, 6. they click link in e-mail to go back to Renew.php, 7. repeat at step 3
[06/19/2007 01:12:08 PM] Robert Douglas: do they have to click a link in their email?
[06/19/2007 01:12:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: they click the link in the email yes
[06/19/2007 01:12:53 PM] Robert Douglas: we should have a page to do the renewal
[06/19/2007 01:12:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: or they can just go to the renew.php page
[06/19/2007 01:12:58 PM] Robert Douglas: like a link for the renewal
[06/19/2007 01:13:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the renewal page
[06/19/2007 01:13:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so i could manually go to the renewal.php page
[06/19/2007 01:13:39 PM] Robert Douglas: and fill out the form
[06/19/2007 01:13:41 PM] Robert Douglas: and click submit
[06/19/2007 01:14:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to fill anything out
[06/19/2007 01:14:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the renew.php is just a button for paypal
[06/19/2007 01:14:13 PM] Robert Douglas: so in order to renew, you just hit submit?
[06/19/2007 01:14:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/19/2007 01:14:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it gets you name from paypal
[06/19/2007 01:14:56 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Renew.php)http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Renew.php
[06/19/2007 01:14:58 PM] Robert Douglas: so on this page
[06/19/2007 01:15:05 PM] Robert Douglas: you just click the Click here to Pay button
[06/19/2007 01:15:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/19/2007 01:15:24 PM] Robert Douglas: and then once your payment completes, it updates whatever the first/last name is associated with the paypal payment
[06/19/2007 01:15:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/19/2007 01:15:33 PM] Robert Douglas: how does the script know when to check for the update?
[06/19/2007 01:15:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: the Iterator does it
[06/19/2007 01:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and Details does it
[06/19/2007 01:16:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so who runs the iterator?
[06/19/2007 01:16:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: both of them look for new payments
[06/19/2007 01:16:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: cron should run Iterator
[06/19/2007 01:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: to send out emails also
[06/19/2007 01:16:19 PM] Robert Douglas: that wasnt setup tho on the dev server
[06/19/2007 01:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: correct, i didn't set up the cron
[06/19/2007 01:16:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so probably still needs to be done?
[06/19/2007 01:16:45 PM] Robert Douglas: but then it wasnt setup on the new server either
[06/19/2007 01:16:48 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/19/2007 01:16:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah....
[06/19/2007 01:16:54 PM] Robert Douglas: gay
[06/19/2007 01:17:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[06/19/2007 01:17:12 PM] Robert Douglas: that's kinda poor management on my part
[06/19/2007 01:17:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought i told you
[06/19/2007 01:17:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: my bad too
[06/19/2007 01:17:19 PM] Robert Douglas: because i never really asked how to install it
[06/19/2007 01:17:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i just took the code and tried installing it myself
[06/19/2007 01:17:41 PM] Robert Douglas: are u confident that everything will work?
[06/19/2007 01:17:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i try to make an install script, but i should have reminded you about the cron
[06/19/2007 01:18:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i am confident, the only withdraw is the first and last name on the paypal account, but we can change that in the future
[06/19/2007 01:18:40 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[06/19/2007 01:18:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i still feel a little iffy with this project
[06/19/2007 01:19:24 PM] Robert Douglas: seems like the PP implementation was kinda hard to do, due to lack of docs from PP
[06/19/2007 01:20:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, there is practically no documentation, the forums is the only place you can get information, and searching through posts is a pain in the fucking ass, forum posts NEVER show relevant results, its absolutely terrible
[06/19/2007 01:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: the documentation gives a basic how to get started, but i had to search in the forums to figure out how to register a professional account with a fake SSN
[06/19/2007 01:23:40 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, fucking comcast just raised their rates
[06/19/2007 01:23:45 PM] Robert Douglas: another $20/month for 3 months
[06/19/2007 01:24:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: comcast?
[06/19/2007 01:24:04 PM] Robert Douglas: if i ordered it yesterrday i would have been at the lower rate
[06/19/2007 01:24:07 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah in cali
[06/19/2007 01:24:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so now i gotta pay the full price for it
[06/19/2007 01:25:21 PM] Robert Douglas: yay, i called another comcast number and they gunna do the special promo pricing hahahahahahaha
[06/19/2007 01:34:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i sorted my pron
[06/19/2007 01:34:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wrote a script to do it
[06/19/2007 01:34:27 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/19/2007 01:34:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: its hot
[06/19/2007 01:36:35 PM] Robert Douglas: comcst has a free on demand movie thing

[06/19/2007 01:37:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have speakers on my work comp
[06/19/2007 01:37:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i make my new website i am going to make an ajax search for music, and there will be a cron for pulling the information off the mp3s and storing it in a database
[06/19/2007 01:37:52 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/19/2007 01:37:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: sucks for your work comp
[06/19/2007 01:37:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, no speakers sucks
[06/19/2007 01:38:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already have the classes for reading id3 tags
[06/19/2007 01:38:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and its going to alert me of missing information better then windows media player
[06/19/2007 01:38:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: wmp is going to suck compared to my website
[06/19/2007 01:39:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i will make a google toolbar for playing music off my server with my website interface
[06/19/2007 01:39:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: *google plugin
[06/19/2007 01:40:12 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/19/2007 01:40:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to setup my comp as a music server
[06/19/2007 01:40:24 PM] Robert Douglas: so i can access it while i'm gone
[06/19/2007 01:40:34 PM] Robert Douglas: but i need some high tech user management, so that people cant rbeak in and see all my stuff
[06/19/2007 01:40:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, my site is going to be completely modular, i will be able to remove an entire section of the site just by pulling the php file
[06/19/2007 01:41:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and its going to use virtual permissions
[06/19/2007 01:41:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will specify in the admin section the permissions on a folder or section of the site, and all the files under that will inherit the permissions
[06/19/2007 01:42:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so every page will run through the permission check
[06/19/2007 01:42:18 PM] Robert Douglas: that sounds pretty cool
[06/19/2007 01:42:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it will grab the user names and passwords, off the linux install
[06/19/2007 01:42:29 PM] Robert Douglas: have u finished up that band calendar yet?
[06/19/2007 01:42:35 PM] Robert Douglas: client is rdy to start the next section
[06/19/2007 01:42:39 PM] Robert Douglas: brb, need 2 go to bathroom
[06/19/2007 01:42:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i finished the requirements for it
[06/19/2007 01:42:46 PM] Robert Douglas: had some pretty good mexican earlier, heh...
[06/19/2007 01:43:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i make hot multi pages and made the events part of the search page
[06/19/2007 01:43:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/Rock/)http://www.jambonie.com/Rock/
[06/19/2007 01:43:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i was thinking for search results
[06/19/2007 01:48:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i saw that
[06/19/2007 01:49:21 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it should display bvased on the date, in decending order
[06/19/2007 01:49:32 PM] Robert Douglas: so the last band that registered, should be on the top of page 1
[06/19/2007 01:50:24 PM] Robert Douglas: also, the box itself should be something u can click on to take you to the band's page
[06/19/2007 01:50:39 PM] Robert Douglas: actually, just hold off on that stuff for now, ebncause this is something else included in phase 2
[06/19/2007 01:55:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: k i have a test tomorrow
[06/19/2007 01:56:27 PM] Robert Douglas: k np

[06/19/2007 01:56:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes except for the ajax but it still all functions
[06/19/2007 01:56:54 PM] Robert Douglas: as in i can call the client and say we r rdy for next assignment
[06/19/2007 01:57:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/19/2007 01:58:12 PM] Robert Douglas: can we change the links so the calendar is /band-name/calendar
[06/19/2007 01:59:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmmm
[06/19/2007 01:59:26 PM] Robert Douglas: also, the maps/directions shouldn't display, unless the band entered the address
[06/19/2007 01:59:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/19/2007 01:59:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: didn't know what to do with that?
[06/19/2007 01:59:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: how are we going to map the directions?
[06/19/2007 02:00:01 PM] Robert Douglas: k, that's my fault for not prociding doc on that section

[06/19/2007 02:38:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know putting an @ before a function suppresses errors
[06/19/2007 02:55:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: clit

[06/19/2007 03:12:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got it to show the pages correctly on the calendar-view/edit pages
[06/19/2007 03:13:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so tell your client i said bring it the fuck on

[06/19/2007 03:13:56 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, dont worry about the ajax
[06/19/2007 03:14:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that will have to wait until most the features are implemented
[06/19/2007 03:14:21 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/supervapors/Calendar)http://www.jambonie.com/supervapors/Calendar
[06/19/2007 03:14:31 PM] Robert Douglas: how come that doesn't display anything now?
[06/19/2007 03:14:43 PM] Robert Douglas: from the notes, it should output <p>No events.</p>
[06/19/2007 03:14:47 PM] Robert Douglas: under the date/year
[06/19/2007 03:14:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[06/19/2007 03:15:09 PM] Robert Douglas: they had that December 1968 thing listed, right?
[06/19/2007 03:16:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that was an error
[06/19/2007 03:16:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but now it shows no events
[06/19/2007 03:16:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/standpointe/Calendar)http://www.jambonie.com/standpointe/Calendar
[06/19/2007 03:16:49 PM] Robert Douglas: map stuff isnt done
[06/19/2007 03:16:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/19/2007 03:17:00 PM] Robert Douglas: same with subscribe to calendar
[06/19/2007 03:17:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there a way to send it to google?
[06/19/2007 03:17:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, i put that inside the page of info of stuff 2 be done
[06/19/2007 03:17:32 PM] Robert Douglas: Merlin says (2:10 PM): 
(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4687)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4687 r0x0r
[06/19/2007 03:22:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: fixed the get directions link
[06/19/2007 03:23:00 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[06/19/2007 03:23:28 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks like when standpoint entered the address, they only put the city/state on their, right?
[06/19/2007 03:23:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/19/2007 03:23:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: their problem
[06/19/2007 03:24:05 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[06/19/2007 03:24:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: as for the subscribers, i think i should create another table, have a seperate list of everyone that subscribes to a band
[06/19/2007 03:24:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: that way when the band changes something, it can just go through the list
[06/19/2007 03:24:36 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/19/2007 03:24:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and send out all the emails
[06/19/2007 03:24:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: also that will make it accessible by a cron later on
[06/19/2007 03:24:56 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[06/19/2007 03:25:40 PM] Robert Douglas: how do you update the calendar?
[06/19/2007 03:28:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: Calendar Manager
[06/19/2007 03:29:38 PM] Robert Douglas: that's only to add events
[06/19/2007 03:29:44 PM] Robert Douglas: if i want to update it, how do i do it?
[06/19/2007 03:29:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: can't
[06/19/2007 03:30:04 PM] Robert Douglas: that needs to be corrected lol
[06/19/2007 03:30:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: wasn't in the spec that i didn't get
[06/19/2007 03:30:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-P
[06/19/2007 03:30:39 PM] Robert Douglas: the link was removed ont he page
[06/19/2007 03:30:42 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be added somewhere else
[06/19/2007 03:30:51 PM] Robert Douglas: or maybe put on the calendar manager page
[06/19/2007 03:31:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: where on the events should i put the edit and remove buttons?
[06/19/2007 03:31:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to do it later, i need to study
[06/19/2007 03:32:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it won't be too hard to implement since it uses the same add and edit functions as other forms
[06/19/2007 03:32:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking we handle it the same way we do the media manager
[06/19/2007 03:33:03 PM] Robert Douglas: where each box allows you to edit the information
[06/19/2007 03:33:14 PM] Robert Douglas: so instead of displaying the event, you just display the event input boxes
[06/19/2007 03:34:55 PM] Robert Douglas: also, i think we should change the dimensions of the thumbnail for the images
[06/19/2007 03:34:58 PM] Robert Douglas: instead of 150px wide
[06/19/2007 03:35:07 PM] Robert Douglas: we should have it maybe 200px wide OR tall
[06/19/2007 03:35:25 PM] Robert Douglas: so if width > height, then width shrinks down to 200, and height is adjusted
[06/19/2007 03:35:42 PM] Robert Douglas: if width <  height, then height shrinks down to 200, and width is adjusted
[06/19/2007 03:36:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah convert handles that automatically
[06/19/2007 03:36:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: just specify max dimensions in settings.php
[06/19/2007 03:36:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it will do it
[06/19/2007 03:40:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to work on the way things are printed out
[06/19/2007 03:41:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: like in a band profile where it lists the media uploaded
[06/19/2007 03:41:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: its ugly as hell
[06/19/2007 03:41:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should be fancier, then i will implement media into the search so it more customizable
[06/19/2007 03:43:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i can eventually make the script that handles printing out results, print out the edit fields, that will make everything a lot more customizable
[06/19/2007 03:43:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and will enable ajax to pull specific stuff on to a page
[06/19/2007 03:54:15 PM] Robert Douglas: gtg to next meeting
[06/19/2007 03:54:15 PM] Robert Douglas: brb

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Robert Douglas): Wed Jun 20 09:50:04 2007
[06/20/2007 09:50:04 AM] Robert Douglas: when will the calendar be finished?
[06/20/2007 11:35:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: when you stop asking
[06/20/2007 11:35:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: fucker
[06/20/2007 11:36:18 AM] Robert Douglas: well, it has been a couplke days
[06/20/2007 11:36:28 AM] Robert Douglas: i thought u said it was done a couple times, but i keep going back and seeing issues
[06/20/2007 11:36:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have to make the subscription database and add an extra function for when an event is added, not a big deal
[06/20/2007 11:36:43 AM] Robert Douglas: do you have a date that it will be done, so i can relay that to the client?
[06/20/2007 11:37:00 AM] Robert Douglas: i thought this would have been a 2 day max project, but it's going on for like 5 days almost
[06/20/2007 11:37:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i thought it was done a couple of times but i kept going back and realizing i never got a project spec for it
[06/20/2007 11:37:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: just get the next fucking assignment from the client, it will get done
[06/20/2007 11:37:33 AM] Robert Douglas: that's not how it works
[06/20/2007 11:37:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i only started working on it monday, so don't give me this 5 day bullshit
[06/20/2007 11:37:45 AM] Robert Douglas: we get paid, do the work, ask for approvla, and then move onto next item
[06/20/2007 11:37:56 AM] Robert Douglas: u need to relax
[06/20/2007 11:38:07 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm not gunna work with u like this
[06/20/2007 11:38:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol ok
[06/20/2007 11:38:24 AM] Robert Douglas: just give me the day i can tell the client it will be done
[06/20/2007 11:38:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: is the subscribe to calendar the last correction?
[06/20/2007 11:38:51 AM] Robert Douglas: did u take notes on the other issues we talked about yesterday?
[06/20/2007 11:39:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah and i fixed them as we went over them
[06/20/2007 11:39:17 AM] Robert Douglas: so the edit thing is corrected too?
[06/20/2007 11:39:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: no
[06/20/2007 11:39:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the other 2 things on the list you sent me are fixed
[06/20/2007 11:39:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't display map directions, and it does take you to google
[06/20/2007 11:39:56 AM] Robert Douglas: the no events and the maps stuff, yeah, that looks nice
[06/20/2007 11:40:45 AM] Robert Douglas: the current venue should grab the next upcoming show, i think i mentioned that we should change venue to show, and say Current Show instead
[06/20/2007 11:41:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i can do the current venue right now
[06/20/2007 11:41:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am going to use part of the search engine to output edit fields, instead of writing a custom handler that does the same thing
[06/20/2007 11:41:48 AM] Robert Douglas: what are the pros/cons of that?
[06/20/2007 11:42:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats first on my list, then outputting the edit form for the events will be a piece of fuckin cake
[06/20/2007 11:42:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats the pro
[06/20/2007 11:42:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: furthermore, the stuff that gets displayed is customizable with only a few options
[06/20/2007 11:42:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: such as how many display at a time, so it can list pages, and still be editable
[06/20/2007 11:44:15 AM] Robert Douglas: it sounds like it is easier to manage and a good implementation, but it would be better for it to be faster, rather than easier to view code wise
[06/20/2007 11:44:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: and with the way the code is set up, it will really clear up the setFields function, if you look now it has like random special fields, then 2 cases for a shitload of custom printing for media
[06/20/2007 11:45:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it actually should turn out to not effect the speed, maybe compilation will be cut down because i can delete half of a function that does the same thing
[06/20/2007 11:45:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: sec, i'll get an example
[06/20/2007 11:47:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4688)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4688
[06/20/2007 11:47:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: see lines 61 through 175?
[06/20/2007 11:47:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: those are all just corrections for fields that require extra code
[06/20/2007 11:48:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: at line 176 starts what can be moved into the search engine
[06/20/2007 11:48:32 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/20/2007 11:48:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: because it does the exact same thing with printing out the results with the loop, but its almost the exact same code
[06/20/2007 11:48:57 AM] Robert Douglas: btw, a lot of software companies as a big block of documentation at the top
[06/20/2007 11:49:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah in each file
[06/20/2007 11:49:31 AM] Robert Douglas: i think we should start that
[06/20/2007 11:49:39 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4689)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4689
[06/20/2007 11:49:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will go back through and add some more comments, i skimped out after dividing up the common.php
[06/20/2007 11:50:07 AM] Robert Douglas: basically, we should display the file
[06/20/2007 11:50:09 AM] Robert Douglas: version of the file
[06/20/2007 11:50:16 AM] Robert Douglas: last person who modified it
[06/20/2007 11:50:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: agreed
[06/20/2007 11:50:22 AM] Robert Douglas: and then a description of what the file does
[06/20/2007 11:50:26 AM] Robert Douglas: k cool
[06/20/2007 11:50:39 AM] Robert Douglas: this is something that should be done on a file by file basis, as u go through and edit them
[06/20/2007 11:50:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, its just a pain in the ass making all those lines
[06/20/2007 11:50:53 AM] Robert Douglas: later tonight, i'll open up some files i know, and just start adding stuff into it
[06/20/2007 11:50:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i will start adding that
[06/20/2007 11:51:07 AM] Robert Douglas: like the language files i am very familiar with
[06/20/2007 11:51:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely
[06/20/2007 12:41:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/conchrepublic)http://www.jambonie.com/conchrepublic
[06/20/2007 12:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: see uploaded media
[06/20/2007 12:41:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: its completely customizable now
[06/20/2007 12:42:18 PM] Robert Douglas: I like the other way more, this way just looks cluttered
[06/20/2007 12:42:24 PM] Robert Douglas: the idea is nice, to format it and stuff, but i dont think we're using the right html for it
[06/20/2007 12:42:37 PM] Robert Douglas: later on i will come up with a good graphic to display the albums
[06/20/2007 12:42:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah good call
[06/20/2007 12:42:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: just let me know when you want to change the html for it
[06/20/2007 12:43:18 PM] Robert Douglas: for the time being, shouldnt we change it back to how it was
[06/20/2007 12:43:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: all the stuff to format it is in Results.html
[06/20/2007 12:43:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think we're going to mess with that for a couple weeks
[06/20/2007 12:43:35 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe just leave what u have, but comment it out

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Robert Douglas): Wed Jun 20 14:57:47 2007
[06/20/2007 02:57:47 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea what happened to all of the uploaded media
[06/20/2007 02:58:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: some things are missing?
[06/20/2007 02:58:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, all media is gone
[06/20/2007 02:58:54 PM] Robert Douglas: client called about the rap page, saying no rap videos were displaying
[06/20/2007 02:59:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: weird i just played a song
[06/20/2007 02:59:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: huh, i just played another one
[06/20/2007 02:59:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: strange
[06/20/2007 02:59:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i played 2 songs uploaded at completely different times
[06/20/2007 03:00:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but "all the media is gone"
[06/20/2007 03:00:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe for developers sake, let the client know that exaggerating doesn't help and you will need more details
[06/20/2007 03:00:39 PM] Robert Douglas: all the media for rap
[06/20/2007 03:00:44 PM] Robert Douglas: or hip hop
[06/20/2007 03:00:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok let me check
[06/20/2007 03:01:04 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/HipHop/)http://www.jambonie.com/HipHop/
[06/20/2007 03:01:08 PM] Robert Douglas: and he's right
[06/20/2007 03:01:09 PM] Robert Douglas: damn
[06/20/2007 03:01:21 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe we just need to change the db value of the specific media file
[06/20/2007 03:01:23 PM] Robert Douglas: in the song table
[06/20/2007 03:01:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: its probably still rap in the table
[06/20/2007 03:01:49 PM] Robert Douglas: me thinks same thing
[06/20/2007 03:02:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: weird i only see 1 hiphop song
[06/20/2007 03:02:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: no rap
[06/20/2007 03:03:39 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont see them in the DB at all
[06/20/2007 03:04:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't even see the old rap bands we had
[06/20/2007 03:04:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: can you remember any?
[06/20/2007 03:05:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yea, we had a TON
[06/20/2007 03:05:18 PM] Robert Douglas: bodymelt
[06/20/2007 03:05:24 PM] Robert Douglas: striferollins
[06/20/2007 03:05:25 PM] Robert Douglas: gohard
[06/20/2007 03:05:31 PM] Robert Douglas: those are all ones that had videos that i remember seeing
[06/20/2007 03:05:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: those bands are still there
[06/20/2007 03:05:59 PM] Robert Douglas: but their media has been deleted from the DB
[06/20/2007 03:06:22 PM] Robert Douglas: it is a DB issue apparently
[06/20/2007 03:06:39 PM] Robert Douglas: the flv files still appear on the server
[06/20/2007 03:07:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats an example of a song you know was associated with that band?
[06/20/2007 03:07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: 0.51990100 1178091322_go hard.flv
[06/20/2007 03:07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: was associated with the go hard band
[06/20/2007 03:07:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah yes i remember
[06/20/2007 03:08:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: Chance 2 is still there
[06/20/2007 03:08:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, it looks like only the ones listed under rap were messed up
[06/20/2007 03:09:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: very strange
[06/20/2007 03:09:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't think of anything that would cause it to delete it when the genre changed
[06/20/2007 03:10:02 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe when we were adding/removing values inside of the drop down structure for the genre, phpmyadmin automatically deltedf all ones with that specific field?
[06/20/2007 03:10:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[06/20/2007 03:10:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: only one way to find out
[06/20/2007 03:11:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[06/20/2007 03:11:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: genre is text
[06/20/2007 03:11:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: not enum
[06/20/2007 03:12:19 PM] Robert Douglas: why isnt it enum
[06/20/2007 03:12:27 PM] Robert Douglas: the bands are enum..
[06/20/2007 03:12:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: exactly
[06/20/2007 03:12:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: because bands genre is editable
[06/20/2007 03:12:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: songs genre is inherited from bands
[06/20/2007 03:12:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it doesn't matter
[06/20/2007 03:13:02 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/20/2007 03:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you can't edit a songs genre
[06/20/2007 03:13:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[06/20/2007 03:13:28 PM] Robert Douglas: One day Chuck Norris walked down the street with a massive erection. There were no survivors
[06/20/2007 03:13:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[06/20/2007 03:14:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: gosh i just don't see any php code that would delete songs based on genre
[06/20/2007 03:15:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it was one of us who deleted the song data somehow in phpmyadmin
[06/20/2007 03:15:13 PM] Robert Douglas: by accident of course
[06/20/2007 03:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a way to output the database to a file, how about rolling back the database then adding the new ones since then?
[06/20/2007 03:17:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm gunna request an old DB dump/backup
[06/20/2007 03:17:40 PM] Robert Douglas: then we can take that and manually add songs back into the current db
[06/20/2007 03:18:14 PM] Robert Douglas: once that is done, i asked our admins to send over a log file (if one exists), so we can see what exactly caused this to get erased
[06/20/2007 03:18:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah'
[06/20/2007 03:18:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: good idea
[06/20/2007 03:18:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i believe the log will show a bunch of sql commands
[06/20/2007 03:18:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: hopefully
[06/20/2007 03:19:01 PM] Robert Douglas: then we can find out which one did it
[06/20/2007 03:19:05 PM] Robert Douglas: and then find out how it was ran
[06/20/2007 03:19:28 PM] Robert Douglas: brb, phone
[06/20/2007 03:29:20 PM] Robert Douglas: u here?
[06/20/2007 03:29:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/20/2007 03:29:32 PM] Robert Douglas: do u see the .zip file
[06/20/2007 03:29:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: where?
[06/20/2007 03:29:49 PM] Robert Douglas: uploaded to public_html/db_backup.zip
[06/20/2007 03:29:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i tried sending it over msn, but it doesnt look like it worked

[06/20/2007 04:00:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait did you revert the database?
[06/20/2007 04:01:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: back to the old one?
[06/20/2007 04:02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: no i did not
[06/20/2007 04:02:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: because there are rap and hiphop songs in it now
[06/20/2007 04:02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 04:02:55 PM] Robert Douglas: did u add the hip hop songs?

[06/20/2007 04:03:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i added the ones back in that weren't there
[06/20/2007 04:04:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i recognize yaddayee
[06/20/2007 04:04:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was missing
[06/20/2007 04:04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome thanks
[06/20/2007 04:04:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm verifiyng what we can do about log stuff for the future
[06/20/2007 04:05:08 PM] Robert Douglas: also, u know how u changed the rewrite for the calendar so it was band name / calendar
[06/20/2007 04:05:12 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to do the same for the media
[06/20/2007 04:05:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: uhhh
[06/20/2007 04:05:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: k but there is more then just band name
[06/20/2007 04:05:39 PM] Robert Douglas: right
[06/20/2007 04:05:48 PM] Robert Douglas: if we could, we should just remove the Media directory altogether

[06/20/2007 04:06:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[06/20/2007 04:06:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll consider it
[06/20/2007 04:06:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have bigger problems to worry about right now
[06/20/2007 04:07:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ur right
[06/20/2007 04:07:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: like preventing the site from making copies of objects
[06/20/2007 04:12:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: why does dreamweaver suck?
[06/20/2007 04:13:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: why does it check in files that aren't checked out?
[06/20/2007 04:16:24 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 04:17:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think its just taunting me
[06/20/2007 04:18:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: its "checking in" all the files that were never checked out just so i don't have to go through and find each individual of the 30 files that i really need to be checked in
[06/20/2007 04:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fucking hate dreamweaver
[06/20/2007 04:18:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should be called hellweaver
[06/20/2007 04:19:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha cloaked
[06/20/2007 04:20:22 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 04:20:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know why i need the ad server and the helpdesk on my computer
[06/20/2007 04:35:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am changing the naming system
[06/20/2007 04:35:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: for uploaded stuff
[06/20/2007 04:36:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of microtime i am using md5(uniqid(rand()))
[06/20/2007 04:36:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it won't effect what is already there
[06/20/2007 04:38:07 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/20/2007 04:38:23 PM] Robert Douglas: also do a verification that it does not exist
[06/20/2007 04:38:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it can't exist
[06/20/2007 04:39:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: uniqid is based on time down to milliseconds
[06/20/2007 04:39:48 PM] Robert Douglas: the next day, it can do the same thing, if it is done at the exact same time tho, right?
[06/20/2007 04:40:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, its a timestamp with millisecond precision
[06/20/2007 04:40:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it might be the same millisecond but the second, minute, hour, and day will be different
[06/20/2007 04:41:35 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but this is still something from the program standpoint, there is a chance that it will exist, although it is slim
[06/20/2007 04:41:41 PM] Robert Douglas: securit ymeasures should still be in place
[06/20/2007 05:06:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude look at the error info now
[06/20/2007 05:06:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking skeet
[06/20/2007 05:06:51 PM] Robert Douglas: where?
[06/20/2007 05:06:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: the green lines

[06/20/2007 05:10:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: does it show up now?
[06/20/2007 05:10:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i put it in their, then u inserted this new system based on user accounts or some shit, and then it never worked
[06/20/2007 05:10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: yes it does
[06/20/2007 05:10:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: see the fuckin page and line number

[06/20/2007 05:11:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm?
[06/20/2007 05:12:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah i see the line numbers
[06/20/2007 05:12:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'mma make it hotter
[06/20/2007 05:12:04 PM] Robert Douglas: and the ugly green outline
[06/20/2007 05:12:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/20/2007 05:12:10 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 05:20:45 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to be selling kaspersky licenses

[06/20/2007 05:21:05 PM] Robert Douglas: -_-
[06/20/2007 05:25:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: look at the backtrace now

[06/20/2007 05:25:40 PM] Robert Douglas: backtrace ?
[06/20/2007 05:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: go there
[06/20/2007 05:25:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and click backtrace
[06/20/2007 05:25:52 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 05:26:13 PM] Robert Douglas: u are crazy
[06/20/2007 05:26:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know its how
[06/20/2007 05:26:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: *hot
[06/20/2007 05:27:51 PM] Robert Douglas: is there an easy way to figure out page exewcution time?
[06/20/2007 05:28:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/20/2007 05:28:06 PM] Robert Douglas: from the time the server receives the response, how long does it take for the page to completely be processed
[06/20/2007 05:28:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure generating the backtrace creates a shitload of overhead
[06/20/2007 05:28:28 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but we will be able to track things better, ya know
[06/20/2007 05:28:41 PM] Robert Douglas: we will know how long certain things take, and decide if there is a better way to accompliosh something
[06/20/2007 05:29:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but why ar eyou working on error reporting stuff when the calendar thing isn't done?
[06/20/2007 05:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i need error reporting to finish calendar
[06/20/2007 05:29:57 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/20/2007 05:30:02 PM] Robert Douglas: is that just ur excuse
[06/20/2007 05:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and make script more efficient
[06/20/2007 05:35:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to be without interenet for a couple hours
[06/20/2007 05:35:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta head home and then set up my comp
[06/20/2007 05:35:19 PM] Robert Douglas: so internet might not work right away
[06/20/2007 05:35:44 PM] Robert Douglas: but i want to make sure the calendar gets done asap, so can u give me an ETA on that, or ETA on when u will have more info about when you will know when it will be done
[06/20/2007 05:36:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: a few hours
[06/20/2007 05:36:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will be done today
[06/20/2007 05:36:21 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/20/2007 05:36:52 PM] Robert Douglas: what do u think of the kaspersky order page
[06/20/2007 05:36:55 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty cool, eh?
[06/20/2007 05:37:00 PM] Robert Douglas: we can easily implement it on our site too
[06/20/2007 05:37:06 PM] Robert Douglas: we just include a file via php
[06/20/2007 05:40:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like the script is taking 1 10th of a second to generate
[06/20/2007 05:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i put its position in time in the backtrace
[06/20/2007 05:42:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but everything from step 9 to mysql close will be put in a cron
[06/20/2007 05:42:48 PM] Robert Douglas: not bad
[06/20/2007 05:42:59 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie has been receiving quite a few visitors lately
[06/20/2007 05:43:04 PM] Robert Douglas: the numbers are growing very rapidly
[06/20/2007 05:43:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: what keeps track of visitors?
[06/20/2007 05:43:41 PM] Robert Douglas: awstats

[06/20/2007 05:46:21 PM] Robert Douglas: those are unique hits
[06/20/2007 05:46:24 PM] Robert Douglas: different IPs

[06/20/2007 05:48:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: why is that not good?
[06/20/2007 05:48:42 PM] Robert Douglas: because our client spammed myspace
[06/20/2007 05:48:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and got himself banned
[06/20/2007 05:48:52 PM] Robert Douglas: lol

[06/20/2007 09:26:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are gonna love what i am doing with the code for these forms
[06/20/2007 09:26:45 PM] Robert Douglas: what forms?

[06/20/2007 09:27:56 PM] Robert Douglas: why are you working on the media manager, when the jambonie calendar isn't done?
[06/20/2007 09:28:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am working on calendar hence the (currently) comment
[06/20/2007 09:28:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah i will fix top song
[06/20/2007 09:28:34 PM] Robert Douglas: the event is different than the calendar
[06/20/2007 09:28:53 PM] Robert Douglas: we are no longer doing overall jambonie development stuff right now
[06/20/2007 09:28:58 PM] Robert Douglas: we have SPECIFIC tasks that need to be done
[06/20/2007 09:29:13 PM] Robert Douglas: specifcally, the entire jambonie band's calendar,it needs to be up and running 100%
[06/20/2007 09:29:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh yeah but i am making overall changes that will make the implementation for future tasks easier
[06/20/2007 09:29:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so did you get back just to be a douche bag to me?
[06/20/2007 09:29:57 PM] Robert Douglas: can you do that once you finish the current task?
[06/20/2007 09:30:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been working pretty hard
[06/20/2007 09:30:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i've been working on events
[06/20/2007 09:30:15 PM] Robert Douglas: i got back to tell you as a manager, you are not working ont he right tasks
[06/20/2007 09:30:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so don't fucking worry about it

[06/20/2007 09:30:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so don't fucking worry about it
[06/20/2007 09:30:39 PM] Robert Douglas: this is not the way you are going to develop the site, you NEED to have the entire task done, before u go move on to something else
[06/20/2007 09:30:59 PM] Robert Douglas: we are no longer building up the overall site right now, we have SPECIFIC tasks that need to be done
[06/20/2007 09:31:08 PM] Robert Douglas: once they are done, youi can do all the cool extras
[06/20/2007 09:31:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been working on fixing up the code as i went along with implementing the event
[06/20/2007 09:31:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not a cool extra
[06/20/2007 09:31:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is absolutely necessary to correct the code
[06/20/2007 09:31:34 PM] Robert Douglas: dont worry about the events
[06/20/2007 09:31:45 PM] Robert Douglas: worry about the subvscription thing for the jambo calendar
[06/20/2007 09:31:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i am calling the calendar dates
[06/20/2007 09:32:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i've been working on the edit forms
[06/20/2007 09:32:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: calendar = list of events
[06/20/2007 09:32:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry for my terminology you must be misunderstanding me
[06/20/2007 09:32:27 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, but we also have the other thing i was telling you about, the event page
[06/20/2007 09:32:37 PM] Robert Douglas: dont call the calendar stuff events
[06/20/2007 09:32:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am confused
[06/20/2007 09:32:41 PM] Robert Douglas: we have another item called events
[06/20/2007 09:32:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: explain
[06/20/2007 09:32:58 PM] Robert Douglas: call the calendar calendar, and the event page (much similar to the jambo calendar), event page
[06/20/2007 09:33:08 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, the jambo calendar contains months with events attached to it
[06/20/2007 09:33:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: well what is the event page?
[06/20/2007 09:33:15 PM] Robert Douglas: but the event page is something entirely different
[06/20/2007 09:33:27 PM] Robert Douglas: the event pageis where venues will post upcoming events
[06/20/2007 09:33:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: oooohhhh
[06/20/2007 09:33:35 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, the same way the calendar is being done
[06/20/2007 09:33:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok lets start over
[06/20/2007 09:33:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been working on the calendar
[06/20/2007 09:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: the calendar has "events", and now they are editable
[06/20/2007 09:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you will like the way i implemented it, it offers tons of extensibility
[06/20/2007 09:35:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: someday when we implement an admin section, it will take 2 lines of code for the admin to edit ANY event, user, band, or song
[06/20/2007 09:35:16 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool, sounds good
[06/20/2007 09:35:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i thought u were working on the event page, not the calendar stuff
[06/20/2007 09:35:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so let me change my password and you can log in and see the new calendar
[06/20/2007 09:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't even have the spec for events page
[06/20/2007 09:36:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i already logged in and can see the event page
[06/20/2007 09:36:07 PM] Robert Douglas: the edit event*
[06/20/2007 09:36:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[06/20/2007 09:36:12 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks pretty nice
[06/20/2007 09:36:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you make a test event?
[06/20/2007 09:36:19 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, with the delayed band
[06/20/2007 09:36:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: see how it prints it out in that form?
[06/20/2007 09:36:25 PM] Robert Douglas: now when i log in, I can edit it
[06/20/2007 09:36:28 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, looks nice
[06/20/2007 09:37:02 PM] Robert Douglas: January should be the first selection from the dropdown list
[06/20/2007 09:37:15 PM] Robert Douglas: right now it is set to blank
[06/20/2007 09:37:22 PM] Robert Douglas: but i think that was an error ont he template i gave u
[06/20/2007 09:37:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i can fix that real quick
[06/20/2007 09:38:03 PM] Robert Douglas: sooner or later we will want to have a template variable that just lists the months
[06/20/2007 09:38:23 PM] Robert Douglas: like list_month();
[06/20/2007 09:38:30 PM] Robert Douglas: and it will output a drop down list of all the months
[06/20/2007 09:38:52 PM] Robert Douglas: and it will accept a value, so you can set it to be a specific month as the selected value
[06/20/2007 09:39:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/20/2007 09:39:08 PM] Robert Douglas: so list_month() will default print out the months, while list_month("January") will print otu the months, where option selected is january
[06/20/2007 09:39:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: good idea
[06/20/2007 09:39:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: no need for that javascript anymore
[06/20/2007 09:39:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, repetive shit like that is lame
[06/20/2007 09:40:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so allow me to explain the change that needs to be done to media manager after calendar is finished
[06/20/2007 09:40:32 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/20/2007 09:40:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: the calendar prints out each event using the template
[06/20/2007 09:41:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: it goes through part of the search engine so options can be added for multiple pages or limiting the number of events
[06/20/2007 09:41:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the main benefit i talked about earlier
[06/20/2007 09:42:04 PM] Robert Douglas: right, thge seartch engine basically acts as a parser
[06/20/2007 09:42:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if we do that for the media manager, it will be using the SAME code, not a whole bunch of random special cases for media all over the fields.php and common files
[06/20/2007 09:42:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the editable fields will be completely customizable
[06/20/2007 09:43:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the benefit
[06/20/2007 09:43:07 PM] Robert Douglas: i like that
[06/20/2007 09:43:10 PM] Robert Douglas: it is more robust
[06/20/2007 09:43:12 PM] Robert Douglas: brb bathroom
[06/20/2007 09:43:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: for a someday admin section, and just for conventions sake
[06/20/2007 09:44:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, a lot more robust, so i have the search engine part set up to handle changing the media section over, i just have to go back and work on the actual fields.php section for the media

[06/21/2007 08:36:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok we also need to work on the language file
[06/21/2007 08:36:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: all the text in the code should be replaced with constants also
[06/21/2007 08:37:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the way we can test it, once we think its complete, i will remove the include for it, and any text that still remains hasn't been replaced
[06/21/2007 08:38:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: when we get around to putting errors in the language file, user the prefix ERROR_

[06/21/2007 01:09:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah you just asked me that 10 minutes ago
[06/21/2007 01:09:25 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, and then you stopped talking
[06/21/2007 01:09:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was nothing to say
[06/21/2007 01:09:36 PM] Robert Douglas: before i asked you because you didnt respond to something you still had questions qith
[06/21/2007 01:09:38 PM] Robert Douglas: with*
[06/21/2007 01:09:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not just going to keep talking for the hell of it
[06/21/2007 01:09:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am busy
[06/21/2007 01:09:55 PM] Robert Douglas: oh, so then everything is now clear and you have no more questions about what we expect?
[06/21/2007 01:10:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had A question and you answered it
[06/21/2007 01:10:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes everything is clear

[06/21/2007 01:11:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[06/21/2007 01:32:58 PM] Robert Douglas: can u send me ur work log so far so i can make sure that everything is being done right
[06/21/2007 01:33:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh
[06/21/2007 01:33:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/21/2007 01:34:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: Brian's Work log:
 -Redoing part of the media upload to make it more robust
 
 Todo:
 -Subscribe to calendar
 -work on ajax upload
[06/21/2007 01:34:20 PM] Robert Douglas: why are you working on the media if the calendar isnt done?
[06/21/2007 01:35:06 PM] Robert Douglas: also, I see no mention of the email i sent u 2 hours ago, how often are you checking your email?
[06/21/2007 01:35:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: its part of my train of thought, i made a more robust calendar event engine, now i am applying those same coding techniques to the media section
[06/21/2007 01:37:02 PM] Robert Douglas: alright, i'd still rahter see you finish up the current task before applying what you did in this task, to other parts of the site, but if you will honestly work better working like that, then that's cool with me
[06/21/2007 01:37:08 PM] Robert Douglas: what about my 2nd question
[06/21/2007 01:37:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: answer to your second question is, i guess not often enough
[06/21/2007 01:38:38 PM] Robert Douglas: 2 hours is definitely not often enough, email should be checked every couple minutes, but until you get your own treo (which will notify you of new emails), i think every 15-30 minutes is reasonable, do you think you could do that?
[06/21/2007 01:39:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure
[06/21/2007 01:39:07 PM] Robert Douglas: k cool
[06/21/2007 01:39:28 PM] Robert Douglas: you should put our discussion about the work log inside your work log
[06/21/2007 01:39:49 PM] Robert Douglas: because that is another thing you are doing for RPS, and it should be noted that you spent time with me discussing it
[06/21/2007 01:40:15 PM] Robert Douglas: in my work log, i have: 
- Provided example work log to Brian to give example of daily work log
[06/21/2007 01:40:26 PM] Robert Douglas: and then a couple lines down, i put our current convo: 
- Took Brian's current work log to check for being on right track
[06/21/2007 01:42:11 PM] Robert Douglas: understand everything?
[06/21/2007 01:42:27 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno if i am being clear or not
[06/21/2007 01:45:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i don't like this new work log idea
[06/21/2007 01:46:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so here's my proposal, i sign offline for a certain amount of time so that i can actually get work done, and you don't contact me every 10 minutes to express your feelings and aggravations towards me
[06/21/2007 01:46:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't get any work done when i have to switch back an forth to read this conversation every 2 minutes
[06/21/2007 01:47:22 PM] Robert Douglas: talking about issues is part of your work
[06/21/2007 01:47:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you have issues you can send more emails
[06/21/2007 01:47:48 PM] Robert Douglas: if you have a better suggestion to accomplish the same task the work log is doing, i'm ready to hear them
[06/21/2007 01:48:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: trying to keep track of every idea discussed in the conversation is a pain in the ass
[06/21/2007 01:48:43 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, but let's get the work log issue nailed out first
[06/21/2007 01:49:06 PM] Robert Douglas: then we can talk about better way to discuss these things, or maybe what you can do so it isnt such a problem or pain to talk on msn
[06/21/2007 01:49:29 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and myself have no issue with discussions over msn, so maybe there is something we're doing that you could do to make things easier
[06/21/2007 01:50:31 PM] Robert Douglas: so why dont you take a break from the media manager stuff, and let's nail our current issue of discussion
[06/21/2007 01:53:06 PM] Robert Douglas: well?
[06/21/2007 01:59:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'll spend a few minutes talking to you about this issue
[06/21/2007 02:00:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: its pretty simple, for lists of changes and corrections, send me an e-mail with all the information you think i will need
[06/21/2007 02:00:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i will respond when the issue is worked out
[06/21/2007 02:00:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: alex already does it
[06/21/2007 02:00:26 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[06/21/2007 02:00:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: now our history of emails should be all the "log" we need
[06/21/2007 02:00:50 PM] Robert Douglas: just make sure you are checking your emails more often than 2+ hours
[06/21/2007 02:01:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: it shows everything that has been done and everything that needs to be fixed
[06/21/2007 02:01:05 PM] Robert Douglas: if you stick within the 15-30 minutes mark, the email stuff should work fine
[06/21/2007 02:01:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just didn't get around to checking my e-mail yet today, usually i leave it open and it tells me when i get new ones
[06/21/2007 02:02:22 PM] Robert Douglas: np, once u get a treo, you'll be notified about each new email msg too, so it should be even sooner for responses at that point
[06/21/2007 02:02:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: when there are lots of changes that need to be done, i get this feeling of anxiety, and its hard for me to put something down
[06/21/2007 02:03:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i make lots of lists so i won't forget
[06/21/2007 02:03:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have at least 5 lists around my work area right now, from a grocery list, to jambonie changes
[06/21/2007 02:03:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so having a list of changed in an email is really helpful
[06/21/2007 02:03:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: *changes
[06/21/2007 02:03:56 PM] Robert Douglas: np, i'll start putting it in sugar then, i thought you prefered to have things done over msn
[06/21/2007 02:04:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so i've always been doing it over msn
[06/21/2007 02:04:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: sugar is good too
[06/21/2007 02:04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: but sugar is a much better thing to have to organize it all, the only problem is that you will have an extra step to update each task once it is completed
[06/21/2007 02:05:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: somethings are ok over msn, if we are going back and forth on something we are currently working on, then it is good, for example if you get back into jambonie and start replacing text with lang_constants, i hope you will let me know which files you are working on currently
[06/21/2007 02:05:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but as for stuff like upcoming features to add, we should put them in sugar
[06/21/2007 02:05:22 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, discussions need to be done via phone/msn and not through email
[06/21/2007 02:05:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i fully agree
[06/21/2007 02:05:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if its ever more then one change in different sections, then i agree we do need a log, but i think that log can consists of e-mails being exchanged
[06/21/2007 02:06:03 PM] Robert Douglas: u had some concerns about the work log stuff, what's up with that?
[06/21/2007 02:06:18 PM] Robert Douglas: the work log is different from tasks created in sugar, or emails sent/received
[06/21/2007 02:06:25 PM] Robert Douglas: the log isnt to track sugar tasks or emails
[06/21/2007 02:07:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i just don't understand why this log is necessary, it just seems like another thing i will have open on my desktop
[06/21/2007 02:07:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it is required for everyone to know what's going on during the day
[06/21/2007 02:08:18 PM] Robert Douglas: with this job, our schedules are NOT 9-5
[06/21/2007 02:08:27 PM] Robert Douglas: so it is hard to know what happens with everyone during the days
[06/21/2007 02:08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: this log will keep track of that
[06/21/2007 02:09:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i have like 15 things on the log, and i've wasted about 5 minutes or less making the log... when u compare that to the benefits of the log, the few minutes wasted greatly outweighs the benefits
[06/21/2007 02:09:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i just wish there was a better way to do it
[06/21/2007 02:09:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know what would be really swell?
[06/21/2007 02:10:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we had some kind of software that could keep track of that, something we use to connect to eachother and schedule and attend meetings
[06/21/2007 02:11:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think for now it would be cool if we all connect in OneNote, and write out our logs for the day in that, then we can all see it and i already keep one note open all the time
[06/21/2007 02:13:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd rather see an email
[06/21/2007 02:13:37 PM] Robert Douglas: than to have a onenote session open
[06/21/2007 02:14:17 PM] Robert Douglas: later on we will have a better way to manage it all, we dont care about keeping log term logs of the work done for specific dates, we just want to let everyone know what was done each day
[06/21/2007 02:14:31 PM] Robert Douglas: it also helps you be more familiar with what is unresolved and needs to be done for the next day
[06/21/2007 02:16:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[06/21/2007 02:16:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: uhhh you got to restore daily backup of songs database
[06/21/2007 02:16:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: coding error
[06/21/2007 02:16:36 PM] Robert Douglas: u found the error with it?
[06/21/2007 02:16:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i found A error
[06/21/2007 02:16:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: might be related
[06/21/2007 02:16:59 PM] Robert Douglas: and it deleted the song data again?
[06/21/2007 02:17:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but all of it this time
[06/21/2007 02:18:04 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, let's put our work log discussion on hold for a min so we can deal with this (make sure you document this song issue in ur work log)
[06/21/2007 02:23:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[06/21/2007 02:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: how long will this take?
[06/21/2007 02:23:40 PM] Robert Douglas: just submitted request for db restore
[06/21/2007 02:23:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[06/21/2007 02:24:04 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty sure it will be a backup from this morning, or yesterday afternoon
[06/21/2007 02:24:14 PM] Robert Douglas: so anything added in the meantime will be gone from the site
[06/21/2007 02:24:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: just my tests
[06/21/2007 02:24:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: nothing too important
[06/21/2007 02:24:46 PM] Robert Douglas: so you think you found what the issue was, correct?
[06/21/2007 02:25:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it was removing songs because the genre had changed on the band but not on the songs
[06/21/2007 02:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the where didn't match up and those songs no longer got associated with that band
[06/21/2007 02:25:46 PM] Robert Douglas: why were they automatically removed from the db though?
[06/21/2007 02:26:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: when the band went back in to edit their media, the songs were no longer assiciated with that band
[06/21/2007 02:26:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they got removed because they tried to edit their media when it wasn't displaying their current media properly
[06/21/2007 02:27:11 PM] Robert Douglas: what's the plan to make sure it doesnt happen agian?
[06/21/2007 02:27:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: this new system will prevent that from happening
[06/21/2007 02:28:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: because the songs that it shows for editing is run through the search engine where only bandname is used to get the information
[06/21/2007 02:36:00 PM] Robert Douglas: jambonie > restored from backup dated Jun 21 01:00 PDT 2007
[06/21/2007 02:39:22 PM] Robert Douglas: make sure you are adding this into your work log, for example, mine has been upated with: 
- Issue noted regarding Jambonie DB issue with songs (from Brian)

[06/21/2007 03:22:48 PM] Robert Douglas: Merlin says (2:49 PM): 
please keep me updated about status for jambonie's db issue
[06/21/2007 03:41:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am still working on the new system, it is coming along well, i hit a road bump though but should only take me a little longer
[06/21/2007 03:43:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so you are still trying to fix the DB issue?
[06/21/2007 03:43:51 PM] Robert Douglas: brb 5 min
[06/21/2007 03:43:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i fixed what was wrong before
[06/21/2007 03:43:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but this new system will definitely take care of it
[06/21/2007 03:49:22 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome
[06/21/2007 03:53:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fucking hate the new dreamweaver

[06/21/2007 05:24:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: its done
[06/21/2007 05:24:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i implemented the new system
[06/21/2007 05:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: just a few adjustments left
[06/21/2007 05:24:37 PM] Robert Douglas: you never updated me like i asked
[06/21/2007 05:24:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was waiting for you to ask me about it again
[06/21/2007 05:25:03 PM] Robert Douglas: you shouldnt have to, i told you to update me about the DB issue
[06/21/2007 05:25:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i shouldnt have to*
[06/21/2007 05:25:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/21/2007 05:25:42 PM] Robert Douglas: 2:30pm is when DB was restored, so far, 3 hours later, issue still isn't fixed
[06/21/2007 05:25:54 PM] Robert Douglas: on top of that, the jambo calendar isn't finished either
[06/21/2007 05:26:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm a little confused
[06/21/2007 05:26:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: 3 hours later it isn't fixed?
[06/21/2007 05:26:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was never really an issue
[06/21/2007 05:26:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made a mistake and it deleted entries
[06/21/2007 05:26:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been working on the new system for displaying forms
[06/21/2007 05:27:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and now its almost finished
[06/21/2007 05:27:16 PM] Robert Douglas: the jambonie DB issue was noted at 2:30pm
[06/21/2007 05:27:31 PM] Robert Douglas: at 5:30, you're telling me the DB issue is almost resolved
[06/21/2007 05:27:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was never really an issue
[06/21/2007 05:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was all part of developing this new system
[06/21/2007 05:27:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: the DB has been restored, that is the resolution
[06/21/2007 05:28:16 PM] Robert Douglas: this is why i ask to stay in the loop
[06/21/2007 05:28:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not an issue anymore, i finished the new system for displaying forms and now everything works
[06/21/2007 05:28:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: so don't worry about it
[06/21/2007 05:28:39 PM] Robert Douglas: i asked to let me know when you resolved the jambo db issue
[06/21/2007 05:28:48 PM] Robert Douglas: no, i will worry about it, i am overseeing this project
[06/21/2007 05:28:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should have just assumed it was fixed when the DB actually got restored
[06/21/2007 05:29:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it was never really an issue, i made a coding mistake, and of course that has been fixed
[06/21/2007 05:29:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to head home, but i want to finish this conversation, because this action cannot happen again
[06/21/2007 05:29:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually it was fixed 5 minutes after i told you it needed to be restored
[06/21/2007 05:29:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we are done with the conversation
[06/21/2007 05:29:39 PM] Robert Douglas: apparently it isn't clear to you, maybe that's partly my fault, but we need to talk about this so we're both on the same page
[06/21/2007 05:29:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok what isn't clear to you?
[06/21/2007 05:30:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made mistake, i fixed mistake, db got restored
[06/21/2007 05:30:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: done
[06/21/2007 05:30:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll sign back on msn when i get back and we'll talk more if u have time tonight
[06/21/2007 05:30:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like every single other error we have ever had
[06/21/2007 05:30:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like every single other error we have ever had
[06/21/2007 05:30:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: as for the subscription thing, i still don't have any information on that, is the user just supposed to click the link and it works?
[06/21/2007 05:30:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta run

[06/21/2007 06:28:44 PM] Robert Douglas: the main problem i was trying to explain earlier, is lack of communication
[06/21/2007 06:29:19 PM] Robert Douglas: over a period of a couple hours,  i would rather see you as an employee, spend a couple minutes here and there tokeep me up to date with progress ofcertain issues
[06/21/2007 06:29:23 PM] Robert Douglas: such as the DB one we had earlier
[06/21/2007 06:30:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i was under the impression that for the past 2 days you have been working on the subscription part of the band calendar
[06/21/2007 06:30:26 PM] Robert Douglas: but from your last comment "as for the subscription thing, i still don't have any information on  that, is the user just supposed to click the link and it works?" it sounds like you are barely getting started with it
[06/21/2007 06:31:00 PM] Robert Douglas: what exactly have you done with the subscription part of the band calendar? from your coment,it sounded like you dont know where to start, meaning you havent actualyl done anything about it
[06/21/2007 06:50:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey i just stopped in but i am going to eat
[06/21/2007 06:50:09 PM] Robert Douglas: k np, we can chat later
[06/21/2007 06:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll explain my progress when i get back
[06/21/2007 06:50:18 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[06/21/2007 06:50:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: should be like 45 minutes
[06/21/2007 06:50:34 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, i might be going out to eat in like 30 mins or so, but let's try to catch up tonight
[06/21/2007 06:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: basically, i have been working on the calendar and making the forms more stable, including the songs section
[06/21/2007 06:51:30 PM] Robert Douglas: did you know that the rating stars dont display anymore?
[06/21/2007 06:52:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you are right i haven't been working on the subscription part, i was going to do it yesterday and time flew by, but i have this weekend off from all other obligations so i will get it done tonight and have all weekend to work on other corrections
[06/21/2007 06:52:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah sry bout the stars its fixed now
[06/21/2007 06:53:11 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[06/21/2007 06:53:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: kinda

[06/21/2007 08:08:28 PM] Robert Douglas: k, so u mentioned that ur not sure what needsto be done with subscriptions?
[06/21/2007 08:08:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah should it just use the users e-mail that is currently logged in?
[06/21/2007 08:11:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i'm just going to make it a pop up/ using ajax message box to add the user to the seperate database
[06/21/2007 08:11:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: no reason to make an entire page just for a message telling the user they will get emails
[06/21/2007 08:12:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i would rather see it without ajax
[06/21/2007 08:12:46 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, once user subscribes to it, they will be taken to another page to confirm the subscription, they click yes, and then they are taken back to the band's page that they just subscribved to
[06/21/2007 08:12:51 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the way i'd set it up, it will be less prone to issues
[06/21/2007 08:24:35 PM] Robert Douglas: when iu checked earlier, the calendar wasnt displaying any data, client called me, but i told him it was most likely due to u working on the calendar shit
[06/21/2007 08:27:40 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, make sure your work log reflects our conversations, and tasks you're working on, the more u put in ur log, the more work it looks like u did
[06/21/2007 08:55:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: k subscribe to calendar works
[06/21/2007 08:57:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get emails but they always end up in spam
[06/21/2007 08:57:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats why i think we should redesign them
[06/21/2007 09:03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i agre about the emails, odd they keep going to spam
[06/21/2007 09:03:24 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno if it is due to content, or the type of form being sent
[06/21/2007 09:06:58 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll have to take some time to research that later
[06/21/2007 09:07:11 PM] Robert Douglas: if subscribve is done, the AZRN issue is a high priority
[06/21/2007 09:07:31 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to go get some food, i'll be back later
[06/21/2007 09:08:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fixed azrn
[06/21/2007 09:08:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know how to use cron, there is no script, just add the file to the cron
[06/21/2007 09:08:48 PM] Robert Douglas: reply to my email plz so we can keep track of it in their
[06/21/2007 09:09:11 PM] Robert Douglas: if u dunno how to do crons, just reply back and i'll reply with some info about them to help u get it setup
[06/21/2007 09:09:30 PM] Robert Douglas: brb food
[06/21/2007 09:09:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: why don't you just set it up?

[06/22/2007 12:36:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i got them
[06/22/2007 12:37:27 PM] Robert Douglas: we had a talk yesterday about how often you check your emails
[06/22/2007 12:37:30 PM] Robert Douglas: remember?
[06/22/2007 12:38:01 PM] Robert Douglas: the AZRN email i sent out, is over 14 hours without a reply from you
[06/22/2007 12:42:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/22/2007 12:42:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you want me to say?
[06/22/2007 12:43:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not going to change
[06/22/2007 12:43:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i check my email probably 5 to 10 times per day
[06/22/2007 12:43:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so deal with it
[06/22/2007 12:43:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: now if you already know how to set up cron, then you do it
[06/22/2007 12:43:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats my response to your last e-mail
[06/22/2007 12:43:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: here in the IM
[06/22/2007 12:44:00 PM] Robert Douglas: keep it all in email plz
[06/22/2007 12:44:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: otherwise you will have to wait until i get around to researching it
[06/22/2007 12:44:36 PM] Robert Douglas: just to confirm, you are refusing to do what i asked you to do yesterday, correct?
[06/22/2007 12:46:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am saying if you want it done you will have to wait until i get around to researching how to set up cron
[06/22/2007 12:46:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you want it done sooner, and you already know how to set it up, then just do it yourself
[06/22/2007 12:46:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not that big of deal
[06/22/2007 12:47:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are you trying to prove by making me look up how to set it up when you already know how?
[06/22/2007 12:47:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm talking about viewing your e-mails, i told you to do it every 15-30 minutes, then today you said you're only going to check it 5-10 times a day
[06/22/2007 12:47:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i am not going to view my e-mails every 10 minutes

[06/22/2007 12:48:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes you will
[06/22/2007 12:48:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but sometimes you won't, so you will have to deal with it
[06/22/2007 12:49:00 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to talk about what you expect from rps, and what rps should expect from you, because i thought you were trying to become a partner with the company
[06/22/2007 12:49:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: doing work for this company has become a large part of my life, but unfortunately there are other things in my life that don't include talking to you every 5 minutes
[06/22/2007 12:49:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think you are ready yet to take on these requirements of a partner
[06/22/2007 12:49:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: such as sleeping
[06/22/2007 12:49:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: or eating
[06/22/2007 12:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: or taking time off in the evenings
[06/22/2007 12:49:47 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i think alex and I have a misunderstanding here
[06/22/2007 12:49:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes you do
[06/22/2007 12:50:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: alex and I are fine
[06/22/2007 12:50:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never have problems with alex
[06/22/2007 12:50:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't respond to his e-mails every 5 minutes
[06/22/2007 12:50:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we do just fine
[06/22/2007 12:50:30 PM] Robert Douglas: this comes from both of us btw
[06/22/2007 12:50:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have been working on nyb a lot together
[06/22/2007 12:50:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he sends me corrections from the client, and i go through the e-mail when i get it and make the changes, and i send him a response
[06/22/2007 12:51:03 PM] Robert Douglas: we need to talk today about your standing as a developer, because as a developer do a great job, but it seems pretty apparent that you are not wanting totake on the tasks as a partner
[06/22/2007 12:51:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he doesn't bug me about it if i don't respond in the first 10 minutes
[06/22/2007 12:51:23 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and myself both thought you were trying to be part of the company, more than a developer would be
[06/22/2007 12:51:51 PM] Robert Douglas: so let's make some time today to do an msn meeting to discuss this so alex and myself are both clear
[06/22/2007 12:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, see heres the thing
[06/22/2007 12:52:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do a lot of work from a developers stand point
[06/22/2007 12:52:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i participate in everything that is done as a company
[06/22/2007 12:52:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i do a lot of internal work for the company
[06/22/2007 12:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: work that i am not getting paid for
[06/22/2007 12:53:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my problem with you is, you constantly tell me what i should and shouldn't be doing, so you are treating me like a developer
[06/22/2007 12:53:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is not fair to me
[06/22/2007 12:53:26 PM] Robert Douglas: no, that is how alex and I treat each other
[06/22/2007 12:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: as far as the e-mail thing goes, you can't expect me to reply to you every request in 10 minutes
[06/22/2007 12:53:44 PM] Robert Douglas: but let's wait for alex to get back here so we can discuss your future with rps, i have a couple other issues i need to bring up
[06/22/2007 12:53:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you will just have to wait
[06/22/2007 12:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: so get over yourself and put up with it
[06/22/2007 12:54:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i WILL NOT respond to your e-mails every 5 minutes
[06/22/2007 12:54:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes it will take longer
[06/22/2007 12:54:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so just deal with it, and there will be no more problem
[06/22/2007 12:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: no need to involve alex in problems between you and I
[06/22/2007 12:54:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: this isn't even company related
[06/22/2007 12:55:12 PM] Robert Douglas: this isn't just between you and me, alex sees the same problem i see
[06/22/2007 12:55:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, alex and i have never had problems that didn't start with you expecting the world to revolve around you
[06/22/2007 12:56:20 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, well alex needs to be here for this meeting, i think it is really important we sit down and figure out your standing here along with responsiblities
[06/22/2007 12:56:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so why don't you create a meeting in sugar if you feel its necessary
[06/22/2007 12:56:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that i can be sure to be around when its scheduled
[06/22/2007 12:57:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm waiting to hear back from alex to see when he is avail., any specific time that works best for you?
[06/22/2007 12:57:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty much any time today, i will be here
[06/22/2007 12:57:27 PM] Robert Douglas: k thx
[06/22/2007 01:00:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: how would you suggest putting a popup on an input field?
[06/22/2007 01:01:35 PM] Robert Douglas: isnt there a javascript on mouseover event?
[06/22/2007 01:01:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i guess my problem is just placement
[06/22/2007 01:02:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think i have an idea
[06/22/2007 01:02:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am adding popups to the user register page to display the actual error that relates to each field when something is wrong
[06/22/2007 01:02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://paintedtile.com/product.php?productid=3)http://paintedtile.com/product.php?productid=3
[06/22/2007 01:02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: mouseover the imgs on Complimentary popular Background colors:
[06/22/2007 01:02:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: oOo i like those
[06/22/2007 01:02:57 PM] Robert Douglas: 3:30pm meeting, will that work?
[06/22/2007 01:03:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: never was a big fan of it following the cursor though
[06/22/2007 01:03:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that will be fine
[06/22/2007 01:06:27 PM] Robert Douglas: k, invite sent out
[06/22/2007 01:06:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/22/2007 01:29:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.jambonie.com/Register/)http://www.jambonie.com/Register/
[06/22/2007 01:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: cause errors on Username and Password
[06/22/2007 01:29:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the idea is good, but the implementation need work
[06/22/2007 01:29:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: needs to be designed better
[06/22/2007 01:30:32 PM] Robert Douglas: you should just put it back tohow it was
[06/22/2007 01:30:41 PM] Robert Douglas: so there arent issues
[06/22/2007 01:31:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: well it shows the red
[06/22/2007 01:31:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it should show the error too
[06/22/2007 01:31:36 PM] Robert Douglas: why are you working on the jambo register page when there outstanding issues to resolve?
[06/22/2007 01:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: the style for it just needs a little work
[06/22/2007 01:31:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: what outstanding issues?
[06/22/2007 01:32:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: see thats what i don't like about our relationship
[06/22/2007 01:32:21 PM] Robert Douglas: you have emails unresolved
[06/22/2007 01:32:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you think you know what i should be working on
[06/22/2007 01:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: to me, it doesn't matter what order these things are done in, just as long as it all gets done
[06/22/2007 01:34:02 PM] Robert Douglas: Date: Thu, 21 Jun 2007 14:35:18 -0700 
"Please let me know the ETA on this issue. This task has a greater priority than the Jambonie tasks (other than the current DB issue with Jambonie)."
[06/22/2007 01:34:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and what was that in reference to?
[06/22/2007 01:34:25 PM] Robert Douglas: what is unclear about that, that makes you think it is ok to work on a new issue, with that outstanding issue unresolved
[06/22/2007 01:34:37 PM] Robert Douglas: e-mail subject "[RD #CGY-13760-615]: AZRN Database Questions/Issues"
[06/22/2007 01:35:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i fixed those issues, except for the cron that i haven't gotten around to researching yet
[06/22/2007 01:35:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that is part of the overall azrn issue
[06/22/2007 01:35:27 PM] Robert Douglas: you should not be doing additional work, until your current work (that was noted as high priority) is also done
[06/22/2007 01:35:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, that page you sent me is an awful lot of reading, its going to take some time
[06/22/2007 01:35:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you could just do it yourself since your project manager
[06/22/2007 01:35:55 PM] Robert Douglas: np, the sooner you get started, the sooner you will be done
[06/22/2007 01:36:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should learn cron too
[06/22/2007 01:36:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can set it up in the future
[06/22/2007 01:37:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: since it was you that never brought it up the first time i finished this site
[06/22/2007 01:37:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: after i told you that it needed to be set up and i didn't know how
[06/22/2007 01:38:02 PM] Robert Douglas: k, well you know what to do now
[06/22/2007 01:38:15 PM] Robert Douglas: also, i sent you an email about making changes to jambonie, please follow the new protocol with that
[06/22/2007 01:38:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah not sure what you are refering to
[06/22/2007 01:39:01 PM] Robert Douglas: keep the azrn stuff inside that email
[06/22/2007 01:39:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should set up the dev server?
[06/22/2007 01:39:25 PM] Robert Douglas: also, review the new protocol i sent over, if there are any issues, feel free to talk over msn about them, or reply to my email
[06/22/2007 01:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are plenty of things you could be doing right now instead of telling me what to do
[06/22/2007 01:39:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it is in the planning, but until then, that's the protocol to follow
[06/22/2007 01:39:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have said from the start that we need a dev server
[06/22/2007 01:40:00 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, i agree, we're going to look into that really soon
[06/22/2007 01:40:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that sounds like a good task you could get done right now so i have a place to work on future changes and features
[06/22/2007 01:40:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i have other stuff i'm working on right now, but don't worry, it is on the road map
[06/22/2007 01:40:25 PM] Robert Douglas: in the mean time, please follow that protocol
[06/22/2007 01:40:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe while you're looking into that, i can be looking into setting up cron
[06/22/2007 01:40:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: sound good?
[06/22/2007 01:41:07 PM] Robert Douglas: the dev stuff probably wont be looked at until sometime this weekend
[06/22/2007 01:41:20 PM] Robert Douglas: until it is setup, make sure the new protocol is followed
[06/22/2007 01:41:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'm going to edit fields.php now
[06/22/2007 01:41:55 PM] Robert Douglas: why arent you working ont he cron now instead?
[06/22/2007 01:47:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well that should do it
[06/22/2007 01:47:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: that tutorial wasn't very helpful
[06/22/2007 01:48:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so next time the cron runs, everyone that is expired will get an e-amil
[06/22/2007 01:48:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: e-mail
[06/22/2007 01:48:53 PM] Robert Douglas: keep it all int he email please
[06/22/2007 01:49:10 PM] Robert Douglas: if you're done with the task, update the email
[06/22/2007 01:55:17 PM] Robert Douglas: we might have to push back the meeting to a later time, alex had to stop by his dad's place, and i need to talk to him prior to the meeting
[06/22/2007 01:55:34 PM] Robert Douglas: are you avail at 4-5 as well?
[06/22/2007 01:56:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 01:56:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i edited fields.php and mediaedit.php
[06/22/2007 01:57:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you want me to send that in an e-mail?
[06/22/2007 01:58:03 PM] Robert Douglas: nah, u just have to let me know, either over msn, email, etc...
[06/22/2007 01:58:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i care less about specific files, and more about possible customer impact
[06/22/2007 01:58:40 PM] Robert Douglas: so instead of saying mediaedit.php, maybe it is better to say "edited media manager edit page"
[06/22/2007 01:58:52 PM] Robert Douglas: just so i know what is effected by your changes
[06/22/2007 01:59:15 PM] Robert Douglas: either way is fine, whatever you prefer

[06/22/2007 06:34:32 PM] Robert Douglas: just letting u know that you are not folloinwg hte policy about tasks, the azrn stuff still has no response
[06/22/2007 06:35:08 PM] Robert Douglas: when i left the convo earlier, it seemed pretty obvious what the requirements are for the policy
[06/22/2007 06:35:14 PM] Robert Douglas: please make sure you stay on top of this stuff
[06/22/2007 06:35:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there a task in sugar for a deadline?
[06/22/2007 06:35:54 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, but we have current policies in place that you are not following
[06/22/2007 06:36:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: such as?
[06/22/2007 06:36:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i linked them to you earlier in our meeting
[06/22/2007 06:36:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: go ahead and point out a specific one
[06/22/2007 06:36:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: just so i can really get them memorized concrete
[06/22/2007 06:37:19 PM] Robert Douglas: i relaly shouldnt have to, but if that's whaty you need in order to follow them, then...
[06/22/2007 06:37:45 PM] Robert Douglas: "If you are told by a manager to do something, it needs to be done in the order that it is dispersed." (i mentioned in tge meeting u still had the outstanding task) 
 
"When someone asks you to complete a task, you should notify that person about the task, once it is completed. 
 
If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay."
[06/22/2007 06:38:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: k, what does outstanding task mean?
[06/22/2007 06:38:23 PM] Robert Douglas: if we're going to have these problems, we will have to find someone else to take your spot so we can accomplish what we need
[06/22/2007 06:38:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: id say its pretty outstanding the number of times a day to bitch at me about something
[06/22/2007 06:38:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats outstanding
[06/22/2007 06:38:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you're right you should get a response
[06/22/2007 06:39:00 PM] Robert Douglas: you're right, i shouldn't have to complain about you not doing your job
[06/22/2007 06:39:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'm right, there should be a set deadline for that expected response 
[06/22/2007 06:39:06 PM] Robert Douglas: i hate doing it, and i'm sure you hate me telling you about it
[06/22/2007 06:39:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am doing my job
[06/22/2007 06:39:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did do my job
[06/22/2007 06:39:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: now you do yours and discuss deadlines with me, not protocols
[06/22/2007 06:40:02 PM] Robert Douglas: you seriously dont know when this azrn task needs to be completed by?
[06/22/2007 06:40:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[06/22/2007 06:40:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: top priorty
[06/22/2007 06:40:27 PM] Robert Douglas: wow....
[06/22/2007 06:40:44 PM] Robert Douglas: so you were just planning to do it when you get around to it then?
[06/22/2007 06:40:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did work on it today
[06/22/2007 06:40:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i got the cron set up
[06/22/2007 06:41:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so my reponse to your last e-mail was a little late
[06/22/2007 06:41:24 PM] Robert Douglas: 4+ hours late and counting so far
[06/22/2007 06:41:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to wait until tomorrow, and you will see why in the e-mail before i responded
[06/22/2007 06:41:27 PM] Robert Douglas: that is unacceptable
[06/22/2007 06:41:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you never set a deadline
[06/22/2007 06:41:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it IS acceptable up until the deadline
[06/22/2007 06:41:48 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/22/2007 06:41:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: it can't really be considered late if there was never a deadline
[06/22/2007 06:42:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: see the e-mail?
[06/22/2007 06:42:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to wait until tomorrow when i knew something was definitely wrong or right
[06/22/2007 06:42:48 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, np, i sent u an updated email
[06/22/2007 06:42:50 PM] Robert Douglas: should be clear
[06/22/2007 06:43:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't have any updates because i too am waiting
[06/22/2007 06:43:01 PM] Robert Douglas: in the future emails, i'll make sure to set the deadline to NOW
[06/22/2007 06:43:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude you can't expect someone to carry out your every request immediately
[06/22/2007 06:43:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead make it something like "before the end of the day update my on any difficulties or successes with the issue"
[06/22/2007 06:43:56 PM] Robert Douglas: there's the email for you
[06/22/2007 06:44:07 PM] Robert Douglas: dont work on anything else with the company until this is done
[06/22/2007 06:44:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got my e-mail right?
[06/22/2007 06:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am waiting on the server to see if the cron executes correctly
[06/22/2007 06:45:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that will take a day, because my first test didn't work
[06/22/2007 06:45:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i explained that in the e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:45:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i updatred the policy for you > (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=118
[06/22/2007 06:45:18 PM] Robert Douglas: If you have a task assigned, and do not know when the task needs to be done, don't wait to be reminded - instead you need to ask the person when the deadline is.
[06/22/2007 06:45:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so, would you rather me sit here and do nothing while i am waiting?  or continue with the rest of my list of things to do?
[06/22/2007 06:45:48 PM] Robert Douglas: so the task is delayed until the next day, then that falls under "If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay." which you also failed to do
[06/22/2007 06:46:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just sent you the e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:46:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: wtf
[06/22/2007 06:46:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was no deadline, so technically i e-mailed you back even if i waited until tomorrow when i knew for sure what was going on, it still would have been before the deadline that doesn't exist
[06/22/2007 06:46:48 PM] Robert Douglas: the email i sent to u about the deadline, is in your response to not doing anything because u have no deadline
[06/22/2007 06:47:16 PM] Robert Douglas: also, on a manager's note, if this kinda of attitude and such continues, we will no longer be working together
[06/22/2007 06:47:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol ok sorry
[06/22/2007 06:47:26 PM] Robert Douglas: this behavior is completely unacceptable
[06/22/2007 06:47:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool down
[06/22/2007 06:47:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to wait until tomorrow when i knew for sure if there was an error
[06/22/2007 06:47:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i just messaged alex telling him i'm about 1% away from telling you to go work for someone else
[06/22/2007 06:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: no big deal
[06/22/2007 06:47:53 PM] Robert Douglas: just figured you should know how i feel right now
[06/22/2007 06:48:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: k thanks for the update, we are on the same page, i am having a difficulty working with you too
[06/22/2007 06:48:17 PM] Robert Douglas: you can blame me for whatever you want, but the point is, this is MY company, and I will not work with you if this continues
[06/22/2007 06:48:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not blaming anyone
[06/22/2007 06:48:36 PM] Robert Douglas: the thing about having your own company, allows me to decide who i can work with
[06/22/2007 06:48:47 PM] Robert Douglas: if this doesn't change, then we're not going to be working together
[06/22/2007 06:49:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i'm saying, is if you expect a response in a certain timeframe, you should specify that in your e-mail, otherwise i am going to wait until there is progress to report
[06/22/2007 06:50:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok let me make this simple and hopefully very clear
[06/22/2007 06:50:12 PM] Robert Douglas: policy says you u needed to notify the assigner if something is going to have an interruption
[06/22/2007 06:50:23 PM] Robert Douglas: specifically "If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay."
[06/22/2007 06:50:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: just let me explain
[06/22/2007 06:50:51 PM] Robert Douglas: go ahead, just be careful with what you say
[06/22/2007 06:51:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was no progress to report because i wasn't sure how the server would react to the cron i set up, so tomorrow when i knew for sure if the cron was executing correctly, i would send you an e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:51:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what i was thinking when i didn't reply immediately to your e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:51:14 PM] Robert Douglas: you should have replied with that info right away
[06/22/2007 06:51:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: BUT
[06/22/2007 06:52:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did work on, when i got your e-mail, i made it my top priority, and when i determined that i had to wait until the next daily cycle, i worked on other tasks
[06/22/2007 06:52:23 PM] Robert Douglas: the problem still remains "If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay."
[06/22/2007 06:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so don't think i was neglecting your request
[06/22/2007 06:52:36 PM] Robert Douglas: having to wait until the next day sounds to me like "If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay."
[06/22/2007 06:52:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: see i don't know when you expect responses right now, thats what the problem is
[06/22/2007 06:53:06 PM] Robert Douglas: also, from a developer's standpoint, you can modify the cron to happen every 5 minutes, so u dont have to wait until tomorrow
[06/22/2007 06:53:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: how long do i have to work on something before you should get an update?
[06/22/2007 06:53:22 PM] Robert Douglas: work on it until u stop, then update
[06/22/2007 06:53:38 PM] Robert Douglas: you dont go onto the next task without updating the previous one if it requires update
[06/22/2007 06:54:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i admit i was wrong, but can you admit that we need to discuss deadlines for tasks?
[06/22/2007 06:54:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: we don't need sugar to write "Deadline: <insert time here>" in and e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:54:28 PM] Robert Douglas: yea, we will have deadlines for future tasks,but these current ones should be assumed to be required asap
[06/22/2007 06:54:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: for every future task
[06/22/2007 06:54:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: not just the ones in sugar
[06/22/2007 06:54:59 PM] Robert Douglas: in our previous meeting, we said we will start doing it in sugar, but that wont be done until workflows and such are setup
[06/22/2007 06:55:13 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be assumed to have the task assigned done sooner,rather than later
[06/22/2007 06:55:38 PM] Robert Douglas: but i added it to the policy that if the person assigned the task does not know the deadline,he/she needs to ask about it
[06/22/2007 06:55:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: no we still need to specify the deadline for every e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:56:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: for future tasks that are included in sugar the deadline can be specified
[06/22/2007 06:56:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but when you request a correction the deadline needs to be specified in the e-mail
[06/22/2007 06:56:26 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, this has been added to the policy to make it all more clear for u "If you have a task assigned, and do not know when the task needs to be done, don't wait to be reminded - instead you need to ask the person when the deadline is."
[06/22/2007 06:56:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i think azrn is the only outstanding task u need to worry about right now
[06/22/2007 06:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: just let me know in the e-mail when you expect the changes to be complete, or ask like Alex does, when can i expect these changes to be made
[06/22/2007 06:57:59 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, but if it is not clear, you need to ask what the deadline is
[06/22/2007 06:58:16 PM] Robert Douglas: and if it conflicts with other tasks/deadlines, u will be able to discuss the deadline 
[06/22/2007 06:58:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/22/2007 06:58:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but please make an effort to specify a deadline
[06/22/2007 06:58:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok?
[06/22/2007 06:58:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yup will do
[06/22/2007 06:59:37 PM] Robert Douglas: that azrn should have been clear when i said "Please provide me with an ETA on the fix. If you won't have an ETA in the next couple hours, please let me know of the ETA for when you will have the ETA, so I can stay in the loop."
[06/22/2007 06:59:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so there are no more problems between us?
[06/22/2007 06:59:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i sure hope not
[06/22/2007 07:00:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: other then the problem with me having no job security
[06/22/2007 07:00:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is what scotch is for
[06/22/2007 07:00:51 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and i have talked about it all,but we agreed that as u progess in the company, things will get better, but they havent been changing
[06/22/2007 07:01:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, there are certainly personality clashes between us, i can say that you haven't been changing either
[06/22/2007 07:01:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: when we get all the bugs worked out these personality clashes shouldn't matter anymore
[06/22/2007 07:02:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: this deadline thing was a big part of that
[06/22/2007 07:02:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really feel like we got over some hurdles
[06/22/2007 07:02:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and even though i hate you, i still love you
[06/22/2007 07:02:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[06/22/2007 07:02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i have talked to alex to see what i could do to help the situation, he's said he's noticed some changes,same with me
[06/22/2007 07:04:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, we still have problems
[06/22/2007 07:04:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: can we just agree to try and go easier on eachother?
[06/22/2007 07:04:28 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[06/22/2007 07:04:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean how long have you been managing?
[06/22/2007 07:04:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: a year?
[06/22/2007 07:04:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: 2?
[06/22/2007 07:04:52 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and i have been doing this for like 3+ yrs
[06/22/2007 07:05:11 PM] Robert Douglas: ive learned a lot from him because he has alot of business background
[06/22/2007 07:05:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean actually managing a "full time" specialist like myself?
[06/22/2007 07:05:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish we didn't disagree so much, i get frustrated when you complain to me a lot, and get defensive
[06/22/2007 07:06:00 PM] Robert Douglas: if i dont tell u what u are doing wrong (same with myself and alex), then it will continue to go wrong
[06/22/2007 07:06:21 PM] Robert Douglas: it's like having an employee that keeps messing up,then firing him for the mess ups,and then having him wonder why he was fired and not notified about it all
[06/22/2007 07:06:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are just a little lenient with each other, things will go more smoothly, (EXCLUDING when a client requires a response immediately)
[06/22/2007 07:06:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats true, i am glad you let me know when i am doing something wrong
[06/22/2007 07:06:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i do the same with alex, and he does the same with me
[06/22/2007 07:07:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but sometimes when working on a project i just need time to code, like a monkey
[06/22/2007 07:07:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think this deadline thing will really help
[06/22/2007 07:07:46 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, deadlines should help
[06/22/2007 07:23:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: made unavailable name registration based on filesystem
[06/22/2007 07:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: for jambonie
[06/22/2007 07:23:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: just thought you should know
[06/22/2007 07:23:24 PM] Robert Douglas: ah good change, thanks
[06/22/2007 07:23:33 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be a good specific comment for the work log
[06/22/2007 07:25:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: done and done
[06/22/2007 07:27:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so since the popups for the error messages on the register page don't negatively effect the interaction, can we either redesign them or ask the client which is prefferable?
[06/22/2007 07:28:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that are necessary, they provide the information about what the user did wrong, BEFORE the submit button is clicked and another dialog is used
[06/22/2007 07:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: any thoughts?
[06/22/2007 07:29:24 PM] Robert Douglas: 2 mins
[06/22/2007 07:29:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: kk
[06/22/2007 07:29:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: need more beer anyways
[06/22/2007 07:31:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am starting to clean, just respond and wait a few minutes for me to read it
[06/22/2007 07:40:15 PM] Robert Douglas: i just relpied to the azrn thing
[06/22/2007 07:40:41 PM] Robert Douglas: let me check into the jambo thing
[06/22/2007 07:42:31 PM] Robert Douglas: the register thing has an issue, i would rather see a much less complex setup
[06/22/2007 07:42:38 PM] Robert Douglas: because we want to limit the number of possible issues
[06/22/2007 07:43:56 PM] Robert Douglas: try it in ie7, u will see it
[06/22/2007 07:44:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[06/22/2007 07:49:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i replied and specified a deadline
[06/22/2007 07:49:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm the popup doesn't display
[06/22/2007 07:50:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure if javascript has the capabilities to fix that in IE
[06/22/2007 07:50:11 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i'd rather seethe old solution
[06/22/2007 07:50:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, both are applied here
[06/22/2007 07:50:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it still turns red
[06/22/2007 07:50:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just added on the popup
[06/22/2007 07:50:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i can find a fix would it be worth imlementing?
[06/22/2007 07:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: ??
[06/22/2007 07:54:18 PM] Robert Douglas: to be honest,i think these extra bells and whistles just poses potential problems
[06/22/2007 07:54:47 PM] Robert Douglas: our main goal is to have our site's usability so high, that there are neverquestions
[06/22/2007 07:56:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i will remove the new code
[06/22/2007 07:57:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and aside from client requests, i am making ajax compatibility over the "questionable" browsers top priority
[06/22/2007 07:57:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i finished the subscription script
[06/22/2007 07:57:43 PM] Robert Douglas: quick question aboutunpaid members with azrn, th eonly way to get unpaid status is by submitting the form and not paying, correct?
[06/22/2007 07:57:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i have nothing to do other then fixes that i know exist
[06/22/2007 07:58:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/22/2007 07:58:07 PM] Robert Douglas: k cool
[06/22/2007 08:01:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know what sucks?
[06/22/2007 08:02:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: the amount of alcohol in beer
[06/22/2007 08:04:00 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/22/2007 08:04:07 PM] Robert Douglas: some beer has 12%, most i see is all 6, lame
[06/22/2007 08:08:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: XX
[06/22/2007 08:08:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: dos equis is 12 i think
[06/22/2007 08:08:59 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/22/2007 08:09:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love how everything that might be bad for you says "ACCORDING to the surgeon genreal"
[06/22/2007 08:09:28 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/22/2007 08:09:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[06/22/2007 08:09:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck that douche bag
[06/22/2007 08:09:34 PM] Robert Douglas: that is funny
[06/22/2007 08:10:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it is because a bunch of fuckers keep taking stupid shit to court
[06/22/2007 08:11:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you only live once, if alcohol caused cancer i'd drink everclear every day
[06/22/2007 08:11:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love boos
[06/22/2007 08:26:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so my drunken rage consists of determining what to clean
[06/22/2007 08:32:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: the pale ale sam adams is the only sam adams i can stand
[06/22/2007 08:32:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck boston lager
[06/22/2007 08:32:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: only taste good when already drunk (which i am)
[06/22/2007 08:51:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: get my e-mails?
[06/22/2007 08:51:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: should have been 1 e-mail but i was being ADD and switching back and forth and left something out
[06/22/2007 08:52:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: 2 e-mails in response to you adding members for testing that should have been done the first time the site went live
[06/22/2007 08:59:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you get new e-mails?
[06/22/2007 08:59:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me know reply when you get the chance t=no rush
[06/22/2007 09:00:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: *no

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Robert Douglas): Fri Jun 22 21:12:10 2007
[06/22/2007 09:38:13 PM] Robert Douglas: y0, rdy
[06/22/2007 09:41:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i ran the test
[06/22/2007 09:41:16 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like it worked
[06/22/2007 09:41:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got 2 e-mails?
[06/22/2007 09:41:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: 1 for expiration and 1 for renewal?
[06/22/2007 09:41:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you just run the Iterator?
[06/22/2007 09:41:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i should change the time for the cron to middle of the night
[06/22/2007 09:46:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: ???
[06/22/2007 09:46:37 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, yes
[06/22/2007 09:46:40 PM] Robert Douglas: and yes
[06/22/2007 09:46:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool
[06/22/2007 09:47:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we set the cron for like 3 AM on the live site?
[06/22/2007 09:47:50 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[06/22/2007 09:47:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you want to changes over?  because i have just been doing the dev site, not sure if they are the same files
[06/22/2007 09:48:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: *want to move the changes over
[06/22/2007 09:48:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll take care of the changes and cron for dev server
[06/22/2007 09:48:48 PM] Robert Douglas: to move it over to live one
[06/22/2007 09:48:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok and i sent you the e-mail with the command
[06/22/2007 09:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we should be set to go right?
[06/22/2007 09:49:29 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, as long as the instructions havent changed, everything should be good 2 go
[06/22/2007 09:49:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yep, i sent you explanations of what i changed
[06/22/2007 09:50:16 PM] Robert Douglas: ok sounds good
[06/22/2007 09:50:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, let me know if you have anymore problems
[06/22/2007 09:51:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator wasn't actually changed, that worked perfectly, just the cron needed setting up
[06/22/2007 09:51:25 PM] Robert Douglas: ok sweet
[06/22/2007 09:51:43 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks like the iterator actually checks to make sure that the user doesnt receive 2 emails
[06/22/2007 09:51:44 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[06/22/2007 09:52:07 PM] Robert Douglas: the only thing left for me to test  is a new signup/payment and to make sure that renewals work
[06/22/2007 09:52:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, it changes the staus
[06/22/2007 09:52:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: *status or sendMail field
[06/22/2007 09:52:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and just for future reference i can set up crons for jambonie eventually
[06/22/2007 09:52:30 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome
[06/22/2007 09:52:52 PM] Robert Douglas: crons can be tricky sometimes, depending on how ur script is implemented and the reqquirements of it
[06/22/2007 09:52:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if a user registers and doesn't pay, that can be corrected by returning to renew.php
[06/22/2007 09:53:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we want to set up an e-mail for new users, that is possible, i will just need a form for customizing the email text
[06/22/2007 09:54:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude i've gone through the entire Journey album and don't remember a thing
[06/22/2007 09:54:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so send me an e-mail for future implementations
[06/22/2007 09:55:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: because its likely i won't remember a thing when i am drunk

[06/24/2007 04:43:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll have to confirm with alex
[06/24/2007 04:43:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: for ffz?
[06/24/2007 04:43:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[06/24/2007 04:44:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't do that much work on it
[06/24/2007 04:44:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get 750 for jambonie still
[06/24/2007 04:44:16 PM] Robert Douglas: you were supposed to get 1500 i thought
[06/24/2007 04:44:28 PM] Robert Douglas: it is just split betweenjambo and ffz
[06/24/2007 04:44:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess that makes sense
[06/24/2007 04:46:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are you making on jambonie?
[06/24/2007 04:46:42 PM] Robert Douglas: nothing, i just put everything back into the company cuz i'm a partner
[06/24/2007 04:47:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you need money from me?
[06/24/2007 04:47:25 PM] Robert Douglas: nah
[06/24/2007 04:47:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so far i've only been asked to work for free on internal projects
[06/24/2007 04:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: obviously i don't expect any payment when we start working on the rp-s site
[06/24/2007 04:47:52 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/24/2007 04:48:02 PM] Robert Douglas: all the prrojects i'm working on now, just benefits the company
[06/24/2007 04:50:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope we can get this paying on time thing worked out
[06/24/2007 04:50:27 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah,alex and i thought about it
[06/24/2007 04:50:41 PM] Robert Douglas: our plan is to walk away with 2 checks, one for payment now, and another for final payment
[06/24/2007 04:50:46 PM] Robert Douglas: then we just cash the final once site is done
[06/24/2007 04:51:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: interesting idea
[06/24/2007 04:51:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: like holding their checks
[06/24/2007 04:51:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: that way they are forced to pay
[06/24/2007 04:51:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we should really make up a document explaining the entire process to them in detail
[06/24/2007 04:52:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we will
[06/24/2007 04:52:43 PM] Robert Douglas: this FFZ shit is fucked up
[06/24/2007 04:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, we need to put it in the protocol that after the clients single list of changes they get charged for the final payment
[06/24/2007 04:54:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i agree
[06/24/2007 04:54:16 PM] Robert Douglas: brb need 2 restart

[06/24/2007 06:14:00 PM] Robert Douglas: k cool, just cleaning up the rps account to get rdy for the new website
[06/24/2007 06:14:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: k i will reinstall websvn on the svn sites
[06/24/2007 06:14:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i was a cyborg
[06/24/2007 06:15:28 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/24/2007 06:15:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should write viruses
[06/24/2007 06:15:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: now that i know assembly
[06/24/2007 06:16:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, i am sure ur skills will not be detected by AV that has hundreds of experienced anti virus developers working constantly on their software to protect against viruses
[06/24/2007 06:17:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[06/24/2007 06:17:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can find loop holes, i've written malicious software before without it knowing
[06/24/2007 06:18:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i see your point, there are hackers working for anti-virus companies
[06/24/2007 06:18:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but theres nothing as fun as running deltree C:\ on the computers at compUSA
[06/24/2007 06:18:49 PM] Robert Douglas: u might be able to write a program that can delete a file, but a real virus? pretty hard to even come up with an idea that will be widespread
[06/24/2007 06:19:12 PM] Robert Douglas: even if u find a hole u want to make visible, u still gotta find a way to infect everyone
[06/24/2007 06:19:56 PM] Robert Douglas: just cleaned up the rps folder
[06/24/2007 06:19:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i'd rather find hacks, then sell them back to microsoft
[06/24/2007 06:20:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the way to do it
[06/24/2007 06:20:14 PM] Robert Douglas: my friend made $5k before doing that
[06/24/2007 06:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: theres this one hack being held for ransom for like 20 mil
[06/24/2007 06:20:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: in vista
[06/24/2007 06:20:27 PM] Robert Douglas: he's making 100k/yr now 
[06/24/2007 06:20:30 PM] Robert Douglas: just finished college

[06/24/2007 06:21:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, still a lot to do though
[06/24/2007 06:21:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so there are 2 types of tasks
[06/24/2007 06:22:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: the ones in projects and the ones under activities
[06/24/2007 06:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: the ones in activities will be the ones i can write a workflow for
[06/24/2007 06:22:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we will use to schedule stuff that needs to get done
[06/24/2007 06:23:01 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[06/24/2007 06:24:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: these tasks can be assigned to a project and a person, strange, the tasks under projects didn't look like they could be assigned to a person

[06/24/2007 06:29:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: its nice
[06/24/2007 06:29:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm i'mma convert the top lists on jambonie to a cron job as soon as you set up the dev site
[06/24/2007 06:29:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: that should really speed things up
[06/24/2007 06:29:43 PM] Robert Douglas: that's a good idea
[06/24/2007 06:30:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: should be a pretty quick change
[06/24/2007 06:30:55 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, just keep the script inside of a cron
[06/24/2007 06:31:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: might even be worth making a database for it and just getting the HTML out of that, just to avoid those filesystem permission holes, but doesn't matter either way it will be a cron
[06/24/2007 06:31:24 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, would be better to store in another db maybe
[06/24/2007 06:31:35 PM] Robert Douglas: the more robust it is, the better it will handle loads in the future
[06/24/2007 06:31:42 PM] Robert Douglas: ebay has 150 different databases on info
[06/24/2007 06:31:49 PM] Robert Douglas: they started out with everything inside of a single db

[06/24/2007 06:44:00 PM] Robert Douglas: Q - Why can't I sign up with my hotmail, gmail, yahoo, etc. account? 
A - Because we have had an endless list of morons who sign up with hotmail or yahoo addresses and then proceed to spam the forum, post leeched passes, advertise that they sell viagra, flame other members, etc. When we ban them they would simply take 2 minutes to get a new hotmail address and sign up with a new name. All free emai

[06/25/2007 10:17:27 PM] Robert Douglas: so the developer for one client can see the folders for another client, but they won't be able to access the actual folders, correct?

[06/25/2007 10:20:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: no they won't be able to see the folders for another client
[06/25/2007 10:20:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: they will just be able to see the folders exist that are in the path to the folder they are allowed to edit
[06/25/2007 10:20:50 PM] Robert Douglas: so the ev will be able 2 see the client's folder, but they wont be allowed to access anything other than the dev folder under the clinet"?
[06/25/2007 10:21:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 10:21:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that's n[
[06/25/2007 10:21:15 PM] Robert Douglas: np
[06/25/2007 10:21:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: say we give them the path NYB->website->dev
[06/25/2007 10:21:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: they will only be able to access dev, but they will be able to see that NYB and website exist
[06/25/2007 10:21:53 PM] Robert Douglas: righ
[06/25/2007 10:21:53 PM] Robert Douglas: t
[06/25/2007 10:22:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: the nice thing is that is can all exist in the same repository NYB
[06/25/2007 10:22:19 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[06/25/2007 10:22:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was kind of wrong about having to seperate every folder into a new repository if we wanted different permissions
[06/25/2007 10:22:48 PM] Robert Douglas: just keep in mind that if u say they can see other client's folders, then we're gunna have to come up with another solution
[06/25/2007 10:22:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: but our plans for the file structure are good right now
[06/25/2007 10:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: no they won't be able to see another client because those are seperate repos
[06/25/2007 10:23:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of, they are all hosted by the same server, but they have different version numbers and different files
[06/25/2007 10:24:17 PM] Robert Douglas: ok souns good

all?"
[06/25/2007 10:35:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude i can't work like 27
[06/25/2007 10:35:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: even 3 hours ago was 7
[06/25/2007 10:35:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats dinner time
[06/25/2007 10:36:46 PM] Robert Douglas: rule is, u check email 15-30 mins, so u would have known about the issue as per protocol, then you would have seen the deadline was listed so it is clear thatitis  "done over any current or future tasks unless otherwise noted"
[06/25/2007 10:36:54 PM] Robert Douglas: meaning, it has priority over the SVN stuff
[06/25/2007 10:37:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah and like i said i can't work 24/7
[06/25/2007 10:37:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: SVN is easy and fun more me
[06/25/2007 10:37:27 PM] Robert Douglas: i know, but u are working on svn stuff
[06/25/2007 10:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: its something i do in my free time
[06/25/2007 10:37:32 PM] Robert Douglas: this should be done BEFORE svn
[06/25/2007 10:37:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[06/25/2007 10:37:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do need time to myself in the evenings
[06/25/2007 10:38:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i probably worked on azrn for 3 or 4 hours
[06/25/2007 10:38:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: spent 3 hours of NYB stuff
[06/25/2007 10:38:27 PM] Robert Douglas: if you werent planning on doing it, as perprotocol, u are still supposed to say that, especially when it was noted earlier today that these issues should be resolvbed
[06/25/2007 10:38:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats a good 7/8 hour day
[06/25/2007 10:38:37 PM] Robert Douglas: on Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2007 11:38:38 -0700
[06/25/2007 10:38:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i mentioned it should be done today
[06/25/2007 10:38:52 PM] Robert Douglas: so that's the majority part of the day to work on it
[06/25/2007 10:39:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i sent you an e-mail i know the script works
[06/25/2007 10:39:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should have more confidence
[06/25/2007 10:39:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm just telling u that you didnt follow the protocol
[06/25/2007 10:39:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i have confidence u will fix it anditwill work
[06/25/2007 10:39:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont doubt your abilities to fixit
[06/25/2007 10:39:51 PM] Robert Douglas: you just failed protocol and i'm pointing it out
[06/25/2007 10:40:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: well sorry i decided to take some time off
[06/25/2007 10:40:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, i hardly consider working on the SVN work, because it is fun for me, i enjoy implementing things our company as a whole can use
[06/25/2007 10:41:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: same with working on workflows
[06/25/2007 10:41:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: either way it has to get done
[06/25/2007 10:41:18 PM] Robert Douglas: as per the protocol., u need to make it clear that u arent planning to make the deadline, and you arent planning to reply for a couple hours
[06/25/2007 10:41:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: tomorrow after i work on AZRN, i'll probably work on workflows and wait to hear back on jambonie
[06/25/2007 10:41:59 PM] Robert Douglas: "If there are delays with the task, notify the person about the delay."
[06/25/2007 10:42:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did notify you
[06/25/2007 10:42:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i told you i was waiting for the payment to be confirmed and i was confident that at that state the script is flawless
[06/25/2007 10:42:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already tested it before
[06/25/2007 10:42:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: that part atleast
[06/25/2007 10:42:56 PM] Robert Douglas: right, but you didn't reply to lastemail that was sent
[06/25/2007 10:43:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and now that its implemented into the Iterator there are no more holes
[06/25/2007 10:43:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it was sent 3 minutes after you sent out your previous email
[06/25/2007 10:43:34 PM] Robert Douglas: and your plan was not to work on the project anymore until tomorrow, according to the protocol, u need to notify the person who assigned you the project
[06/25/2007 10:43:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: well how many damn e-mails do i need to tell you that it will work and i am waiting on paypal?
[06/25/2007 10:43:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont give a fuck how many emails, we have protocolfor a reason
[06/25/2007 10:44:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: see notifying you IS WORK, so if i am not working any more that evening, you will have to wait
[06/25/2007 10:44:10 PM] Robert Douglas: if you are putting the project off until tomorrow,then you need to tell the person
[06/25/2007 10:44:24 PM] Robert Douglas: SVN is a task "DO NOT start working on the 1st one, then deviate to go work on another one."
[06/25/2007 10:44:32 PM] Robert Douglas: protocol also covers that too
[06/25/2007 10:44:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i dunno why we're arguing here, i'm stating items directly out of the protocols
[06/25/2007 10:45:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, working on the SVN is hardly work
[06/25/2007 10:45:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is something i enjoy, responding to your fucking e-mails every five minutes is less then enjoyable
[06/25/2007 10:45:41 PM] Robert Douglas: that's besides the point, it is an RPS task
[06/25/2007 10:45:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if it wasn't the RPS svn, it would be my own
[06/25/2007 10:45:52 PM] Robert Douglas: find another company to work for then
[06/25/2007 10:45:59 PM] Robert Douglas: that's how it is
[06/25/2007 10:46:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and just FYI alex said the svn was high priority, it was actually on my list of things to do RIGHT AFTER for on NYB corrections
[06/25/2007 10:46:43 PM] Robert Douglas: lol, u gunna keep changing your reasoning until you try to find a loop hole so you dont think you are "at fault"
[06/25/2007 10:46:52 PM] Robert Douglas: think about what i said, and dont fuck up again
[06/25/2007 10:47:03 PM] Robert Douglas: protocls were written for you so you understand what the requirements are
[06/25/2007 10:47:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, just telling you how it is, i can send you the conversation if you like
[06/25/2007 10:47:20 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and myself know these thungs because we work with each other a lot
[06/25/2007 10:47:32 PM] Robert Douglas: AZRN is geater priority than SVN
[06/25/2007 10:48:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: look i don't have to argue with you, i believe that i am in the right, and you believe that i am wrong, and its obvious that with our stubborness this isn't going to be resolved
[06/25/2007 10:49:26 PM] Robert Douglas: you're really not going to get far if this keeps up, sooner or lateri'm just going to say we'regoing out separate ways
[06/25/2007 10:49:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so keep that in mind
[06/25/2007 10:49:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like to work on multiple projects at a time, maybe its my ADD, but i took the evening off to work on the SVN that according to the other manager had high priority as well
[06/25/2007 10:50:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know what to tell you, i can't respond to your e-mail by the time you expect responses
[06/25/2007 10:50:45 PM] Robert Douglas: yes you can, you just have to change your current way about doing work
[06/25/2007 10:50:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: you keep insisting that i have outstanding e-mails, when in the real world, if i had an office to work in, i would have gone home, and therefore not checked to see if you e-mailed me every 15 minutes
[06/25/2007 10:50:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: make sense?
[06/25/2007 10:51:05 PM] Robert Douglas: if you plan to work for a company, you cant expect that your habits will not be changed
[06/25/2007 10:51:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: lets pretend that at 7o'clock i went home
[06/25/2007 10:51:19 PM] Robert Douglas: you need to learn to adapt
[06/25/2007 10:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: now see there is where you are wrong
[06/25/2007 10:51:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: my father doesn't do any work after he goes home
[06/25/2007 10:51:46 PM] Robert Douglas: that's fine, if you rather work a set amoun of hours,we can do that, and make sure all work we assign for you is within that hour structure
[06/25/2007 10:51:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: he keeps a day planner, and if people call him about work he will make note of it
[06/25/2007 10:52:05 PM] Robert Douglas: but that's not how it is setup, so you can't take advantage of that idea, and not actually work hours like that
[06/25/2007 10:52:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but tasks and replys all have to wait until the next day
[06/25/2007 10:52:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: during his work hours
[06/25/2007 10:52:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that is why i believe you are wrong
[06/25/2007 10:52:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but you dont work the same hours like him lol
[06/25/2007 10:52:40 PM] Robert Douglas: you're comparing yourself to someone who does a 9-5
[06/25/2007 10:52:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i have a good work ethic that i picked up from him, and it doesn't include responding to your e-mails every 15 minutes
[06/25/2007 10:52:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i do work hard
[06/25/2007 10:52:59 PM] Robert Douglas: you can work for someone else, or learn to adapt to our requirements
[06/25/2007 10:53:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: but in the evenings i like to take time off, and sometimes work on my own projects
[06/25/2007 10:53:12 PM] Robert Douglas: we're not requiring you to work for us
[06/25/2007 10:53:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i consider working on the svn, my own project
[06/25/2007 10:53:27 PM] Robert Douglas: but if you do,you have requirements
[06/25/2007 10:54:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: look you keep threatening to fire me, but i can garuntee that 1. alex will not agree with your decision when he hears my explanation, and 2. you will never find a more loyal and hard working employee that i am
[06/25/2007 10:54:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: what if you were annoying your xhtml programmer ryan right now?
[06/25/2007 10:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: would he respond to your e-mails every 15 minutes?
[06/25/2007 10:54:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have to, Ryan doesnt fuck up
[06/25/2007 10:54:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[06/25/2007 10:54:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: how did i fuck up?
[06/25/2007 10:55:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: by not replying the same day?
[06/25/2007 10:55:01 PM] Robert Douglas: so you're comparing yourself to a developer now?
[06/25/2007 10:55:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: after i already replyed to 4 of your e-mails today?
[06/25/2007 10:55:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am saying that working on AZRN is developer work
[06/25/2007 10:55:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so in that case i should be treated like a specialist
[06/25/2007 10:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: working on internal stuff i have projects to manage like you or alex
[06/25/2007 10:56:04 PM] Robert Douglas: if you want us to treat u like a regular developer that's fine,but i always thought you wanted to be more
[06/25/2007 10:56:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why we're laying out rules
[06/25/2007 10:56:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would love to be more, but when it comes to working on a website i am a developer
[06/25/2007 10:56:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when it comes to working on internal projects, my opinion has weight in the company
[06/25/2007 10:57:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you didn't read my writeup on allocation of authority
[06/25/2007 10:57:06 PM] Robert Douglas: also, if alex or myself decidethat we cant work with a specific person, and nothing we have tried can fix it (by changing attitude, or implementing easy to understand protocols that apparently still won't work), since we're partners, we have to do the better thing for the company
[06/25/2007 10:57:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i was just a developer would we really be having this argument
[06/25/2007 10:57:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[06/25/2007 10:57:36 PM] Robert Douglas: this shit wont happen again, because my next convo, is going to be apologizing to you for wasting your time, and that we're gunna be finding someone else to come in as a partner
[06/25/2007 10:57:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have made a lot of adjustments, i do check my e-mail every 15 minutes during the hours i consider working
[06/25/2007 10:57:47 PM] Robert Douglas: no, if you were JUST a developer you would be treated ENTIRELY different
[06/25/2007 10:58:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: see we need to work out your perspectives
[06/25/2007 10:58:06 PM] Robert Douglas: according to our last meeting, your goal/attitude is you want more than a developer status
[06/25/2007 10:58:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would be more then happy to work for the company outside normal work hours, but as far as working on a task for a website, that is going to have to stay within work hours
[06/25/2007 10:58:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i spend all my time working on a website, when do i work on other stuff the company needs?
[06/25/2007 10:58:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i spend all my time working on a website, when do i work on other stuff the company needs?
[06/25/2007 10:59:01 PM] Robert Douglas: so now you're saying you want to work "normal work hours" ?
[06/25/2007 11:00:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: as a developer i would like to work developer hours with developer expectations, but as a partner here i am working on something we NEED and have planned out for weeks as 10 fucking PM at night, if anything i am going above and beyond the call of duty
[06/25/2007 11:00:24 PM] Robert Douglas: your doing developement as a partner/developer
[06/25/2007 11:00:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is where the misunderstanding is, i am working 2 seperate lives here
[06/25/2007 11:00:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: one as a partner and 1 as a developer
[06/25/2007 11:01:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm 100% dead serious about the fact if you dont start understanding this shit,you're gone
[06/25/2007 11:01:20 PM] Robert Douglas: you want to continue this conversation and see what resolves from it?
[06/25/2007 11:01:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok lets take you for example, remember when we were working on the jambonie css together?
[06/25/2007 11:02:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wouldn't ask you at 10 o'clock at night to fix some problem that could wait until tomorrow after i had already sent e-mails and explanations of what was wrong
[06/25/2007 11:02:41 PM] Robert Douglas: wow...
[06/25/2007 11:02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: last time i talked to alex about what to do with you, he said give u another chance
[06/25/2007 11:03:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but as a manager and as someone whos opinion matters to me, tonight i asked you for your input on the SVN filesystem and you backfired with protocol
[06/25/2007 11:03:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i think you're losing that chance
[06/25/2007 11:03:52 PM] Robert Douglas: we had a pretty productive convo last time, i thought you finally understood everything
[06/25/2007 11:03:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: look if you can't understand my perspective on how i can't always be there to answer your e-mails, then i am afraid there are bigger problems here
[06/25/2007 11:04:03 PM] Robert Douglas: but it is clear that you didnt learn anything from it at all
[06/25/2007 11:04:21 PM] Robert Douglas: alright, well it doesnt really sound like you and myself are ever going to get anywhere
[06/25/2007 11:04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: and convoslikethis cant happen
[06/25/2007 11:04:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i think you are better off with a company you get along with better
[06/25/2007 11:05:54 PM] Robert Douglas: hold off on the RPS SVN stuff until I talk with alex
[06/25/2007 11:06:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i am going to close this conversation with, if i spend all my time working on some task as a developer that you assign me, i won't have any time to work on other company projects that need to be done, and finally, if it were a regular work day no matter my position i would not be required to work after the day is done and that includes answering your "outstanding e-mails".  I took the night off front work to work on other company tasks, and if that is not good enough for you, then I am not the problem here
[06/25/2007 11:07:25 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why we cant work together, i'm sorry man
[06/25/2007 11:07:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but we're not going to get along, we cant work together

[06/26/2007 05:36:29 PM] Robert Douglas: what are your normal hours?
[06/26/2007 05:37:05 PM] Robert Douglas: you mentioned that your dad works an X-Y (like a 9-5 like most people), and afterwards he may not be available for work
[06/26/2007 05:37:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i need to know what X and Y are, so I know when I should expect a reply and when I should expect a reply the following work day
[06/26/2007 05:38:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: like 12:30 to 6:30, then 8 to 10
[06/26/2007 05:39:14 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, so these are the M-F hours where we should expect you to be available to do work, correct?
[06/26/2007 05:39:34 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and I are on the flexible plan (which i thought you were on too), so i'm just trying to get the specifics so i know for the future
[06/26/2007 05:41:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the general time
[06/26/2007 05:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: outside those times i do my own work

[06/26/2007 08:20:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: apache 2?
[06/26/2007 08:20:34 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[06/26/2007 08:21:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: awww
[06/26/2007 08:21:38 PM] Robert Douglas: apache 2 causes issues, that's why we havent installed it yet
[06/26/2007 08:21:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah bummer

[06/26/2007 08:22:51 PM] Robert Douglas: from mbox to dir storage
[06/26/2007 08:23:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm haven't gotten e-mail yet
[06/26/2007 08:23:22 PM] Robert Douglas: probably wont come in
[06/26/2007 08:23:25 PM] Robert Douglas: for quite awhile
[06/26/2007 08:23:31 PM] Robert Douglas: incoming mail is put on a queue
[06/26/2007 08:23:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: y?
[06/26/2007 08:23:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[06/26/2007 08:24:05 PM] Robert Douglas: What's the login info for the developer account so I can log in to make a test payment? 
 
Basically, to do a renew, I visit (Link: http://www.dev.rp-s.com/Renew.php)http://www.dev.rp-s.com/Renew.php and complete the payment. 
 
Then I wait for payment to clear, and then my expiration value will be added by 1 year, correct? 
 
Also, I just received an email from unpaid@rp-s.com. This e-mail was sent already, why is the e-mail sent again?
[06/26/2007 08:24:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was playing about with the increase decrease, thats why you got another e-mail
[06/26/2007 08:24:58 PM] Robert Douglas: all server emails are in queue waiting to be received,could be a couple hours
[06/26/2007 08:25:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i used personal passwords and e-mail addresses for sandbox this time, i gave you the password for it last time for the first set up and now i have no idea what is it
[06/26/2007 08:26:03 PM] Robert Douglas: you can change the password to something not personal
[06/26/2007 08:26:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its pretty easy to set up, just go to the dev section of paypal and make an account
[06/26/2007 08:26:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah and if i do that i will have no idea what it is a few months from now
[06/26/2007 08:26:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd rather use the same accounttomake sure all things are the same during tests
[06/26/2007 08:26:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: last time it wasn't put into pmxp for some reason
[06/26/2007 08:26:54 PM] Robert Douglas: you can change it to something common tonight, then tomorrow you can change it back to something you remember
[06/26/2007 08:26:55 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[06/26/2007 08:27:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be an even better test if you use another account that you created, that way we have something to compare to
[06/26/2007 08:27:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd like to use the same one u used
[06/26/2007 08:27:24 PM] Robert Douglas: can you just chagne the pw
[06/26/2007 08:27:28 PM] Robert Douglas: and then change it back tomorrow
[06/26/2007 08:27:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides why do you need to do another test? i tested it completely
[06/26/2007 08:27:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did you exact same thing you want to do
[06/26/2007 08:28:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no reason to run another test, also the bank transfer showed up today, so its likely you will have to wait another day to be able to clear the transaction
[06/26/2007 08:28:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i
[06/26/2007 08:28:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you keep sending me e-mails like this is a time sensitive matter
[06/26/2007 08:28:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: just implement the changes already
[06/26/2007 08:28:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: or give me access to the other site and i'll do it
[06/26/2007 08:29:15 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm asking you to change the pw to something not personal,and let me login, and you can change it back to your personal password tomorrow so you dont forget about it int he future
[06/26/2007 08:29:18 PM] Robert Douglas: are you refusing to do this?
[06/26/2007 08:31:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/26/2007 08:31:34 PM] Robert Douglas: k, let's stop[ this conversaion right now
[06/26/2007 08:31:44 PM] Robert Douglas: as it is just going to lead intobad issues
[06/26/2007 08:32:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is easy enough to set up your own account and would provide more a more contrasting test
[06/26/2007 08:32:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: if thats unacceptable then Alex created a new forum for conflicts and we can use that from here on
[06/26/2007 08:32:36 PM] Robert Douglas: is there anything unclear from my comment about about "k, let's stop[ this conversaion right now"
[06/26/2007 08:32:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm telling you to drop this
[06/26/2007 08:32:51 PM] Robert Douglas: dont talk about it anymore,it's simple

[06/26/2007 08:56:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have run out of e-mail addresses
[06/26/2007 08:56:57 PM] Robert Douglas: paypaldev@rp-s.com
[06/26/2007 08:57:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: and 1 for the fake account?
[06/26/2007 08:57:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: paypalfake@rp-s.com
[06/26/2007 08:57:31 PM] Robert Douglas: what fake account
[06/26/2007 08:57:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to sign up for a dev account, then sign up inside sandbox for a fake account to use
[06/26/2007 08:58:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: or i will put the paypaldev@rp-s.com inside my current sandbox account but that doesn't help not wanting to give away my password
[06/26/2007 08:59:23 PM] Robert Douglas: these accounts should be unrelated to you
[06/26/2007 08:59:29 PM] Robert Douglas: these are RPS accounts thta you will use int he future
[06/26/2007 08:59:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so i need 2 e-mail accounts
[06/26/2007 09:03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: paypaldev@rp-s.com and paypalfake@rp-s.com are setup
[06/26/2007 09:04:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[06/26/2007 09:04:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/26/2007 09:04:28 PM] Robert Douglas: once you create the dev accounts through PP, put it inside the PM database,i think you will need to make a Developer folder
[06/26/2007 09:04:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/26/2007 09:12:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are passwords for the e-mail account?

[06/27/2007 11:31:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need to reset my password again for e-mail, the database closed on my and didn't save it
[06/27/2007 11:31:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: and outlook keeps prompting me for it, like it is wrong
[06/27/2007 11:31:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i forgot to save it in outlook
[06/27/2007 11:32:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: sPdlFp7YKpFGaP
[06/27/2007 11:41:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the paypal e-mail account passwords aren't in the database
[06/27/2007 11:41:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably because of the stupid fucking cache that net drive keeps on the local computer, we keep overwriting each others changes
[06/27/2007 11:42:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: so let me know when you get back and we can reset those passwords too and i'll create a development folder in OPM
[06/27/2007 11:47:48 AM] Robert Douglas: sPdlFp7YKpFGaP is ur new pw
[06/27/2007 11:47:54 AM] Robert Douglas: let me know when u have new pw generated for other accoutns
[06/27/2007 11:47:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[06/27/2007 11:48:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/27/2007 11:48:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: so what are we going to do about the database
[06/27/2007 11:49:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: netdrive blows balls, on my free time i am going to find a better solution
[06/27/2007 11:49:06 AM] Robert Douglas: we can troubleshoot it tonight when i get back home

[06/28/2007 09:55:34 PM] Robert Douglas: u wanna know the secret?
[06/28/2007 09:55:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/28/2007 09:56:04 PM] Robert Douglas: they generate a unique item number
[06/28/2007 09:56:08 PM] Robert Douglas: prior to the ourchase
[06/28/2007 09:56:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and?
[06/28/2007 09:56:33 PM] Robert Douglas: and do a lookup using that
[06/28/2007 09:56:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: aahhh
[06/28/2007 09:56:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get it
[06/28/2007 09:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats nifty
[06/28/2007 09:57:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i received a confirmation that payment went through, 1 second after i paid via PP
[06/28/2007 09:57:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: how did you figure that out?
[06/28/2007 09:57:26 PM] Robert Douglas: just buy going through MB and placing an order and  looking at all the vars
[06/28/2007 09:57:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool man
[06/28/2007 09:58:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about this, when i implement it into jambonie, i will go back and put it in azrn for free
[06/28/2007 09:58:30 PM] Robert Douglas: if the complexone u have with azrn is going to work,it's fine
[06/28/2007 09:58:39 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont want to hear the client reporting an issue with it
[06/28/2007 09:59:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: it works as long as the names are the same
[06/28/2007 09:59:25 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds like a pretty big flaw
[06/28/2007 09:59:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've tested it thoroughly thanks to you
[06/28/2007 09:59:37 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we cant have client send over anymore bugs
[06/28/2007 10:00:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho, want to see what i've been working on?

[06/28/2007 10:09:01 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty cool virtual system
[06/28/2007 10:09:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats just the pictures section
[06/28/2007 10:09:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm going to have it categorized like windows media player does
[06/28/2007 10:09:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then do music

[06/28/2007 10:10:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: click and drag
[06/28/2007 10:11:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats how you will add them to a playlist, and based on content type be able to download in a zip, or multiple different kinds of lists, like wpl, rss, plain list (for wget)
[06/28/2007 10:12:21 PM] Robert Douglas: the idea is awesome
[06/28/2007 10:12:25 PM] Robert Douglas: the gui needs some work tho
[06/28/2007 10:12:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: suggestions?
[06/28/2007 10:12:41 PM] Robert Douglas: design a gui in photoshop
[06/28/2007 10:12:47 PM] Robert Douglas: then convert to html
[06/28/2007 10:12:53 PM] Robert Douglas: then implement into ur code
[06/28/2007 10:13:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just basing it off vista, i'd rather have it functional then fashionable, i am not good at desinging guis
[06/28/2007 10:14:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and even worse at implementing them
[06/28/2007 10:14:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i kind of like how only the middle part scrolls
[06/28/2007 10:14:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/28/2007 10:14:46 PM] Robert Douglas: that is cool
[06/28/2007 10:15:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fixed the bottom part so it goes all the way under the folders list that isn't finished yet
[06/28/2007 10:15:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the banner and nav bar colors are going to be different
[06/28/2007 10:16:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats one of the main things that will change
[06/28/2007 10:16:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: really only the middle section is designed like what i had in mind
[06/28/2007 10:16:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i almost forgot
[06/28/2007 10:17:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you hover over a filename?
[06/28/2007 10:17:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it scrolls the name back and forth
[06/28/2007 10:17:51 PM] Robert Douglas: instead of bouncing, might be better to have it scroll left
[06/28/2007 10:17:53 PM] Robert Douglas: and then repeat
[06/28/2007 10:18:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/28/2007 10:18:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C+Thru/C.Thru.zip/C.Thru/Readme+Files/)http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C+Thru/C.Thru.zip/C.Thru/Readme+Files/
[06/28/2007 10:18:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats inside a zip file on the filesystem
[06/28/2007 10:18:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm also going to have it automatically detect and SVN database
[06/28/2007 10:19:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C+Thru/C.Thru.zip/C.Thru/Readme+Files/FOOOD%27s-Icons-Logo.jpg)http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C+Thru/C.Thru.zip/C.Thru/Readme+Files/FOOOD%27s-Icons-Logo.jpg
[06/28/2007 10:19:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it reads the file out from the zip and displays it and doesn't leave behind any extra files
[06/28/2007 10:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool huh?
[06/28/2007 10:21:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah i like it
[06/28/2007 10:21:31 PM] Robert Douglas: could be nice to see a download link too
[06/28/2007 10:21:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it works in both firefox and IE 7
[06/28/2007 10:21:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah there will be lots of download options
[06/28/2007 10:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: just haven't finished those yet
[06/28/2007 10:22:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the filesystem capabilities are flawless
[06/28/2007 10:22:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: it always displays the files properly, it even tries to correct itself it you input an invalid pathname
[06/28/2007 10:23:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C%20Thru)http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/Icons/C%20Thru
[06/28/2007 10:23:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like if you go there, it will rewrite itself to the directory path
[06/28/2007 10:24:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/)http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Pictures/
[06/28/2007 10:24:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i also have the detail view finished
[06/28/2007 10:25:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks cool
[06/28/2007 10:25:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a list view and a category view like windows media player, which will really just be a modification of the detail view
[06/28/2007 10:26:29 PM] Robert Douglas: the main difference between apple and microsoft is that apple thinks about the gui first, and then designs for that,whereas ms codes the software,and then tries to implement the gui
[06/28/2007 10:26:45 PM] Robert Douglas: the idea is that you can always code correctly, but it is best to work on the gui first
[06/28/2007 10:26:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: what would you change about my gui?
[06/28/2007 10:27:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i would design it and implment all options u plan to have
[06/28/2007 10:27:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what the toolbar is for
[06/28/2007 10:27:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: the glass looking part in the green banner
[06/28/2007 10:28:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will be a place to list the songs
[06/28/2007 10:28:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and have options for downloading them
[06/28/2007 10:30:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: if there is anything wrong with it, its the layout, as long as i keep copying vista it will look pretty enough

[06/29/2007 03:19:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm gonna buy one and then implement fancy javascripts into it
[06/29/2007 03:19:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of the other way around
[06/29/2007 03:19:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took your suggestion
[06/29/2007 03:20:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, if u start with a GUI, u know the end result will look nice
[06/29/2007 03:20:08 PM] Robert Douglas: and if you can program good, u know the program will work
[06/29/2007 03:20:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we need to contact admins
[06/29/2007 03:20:18 PM] Robert Douglas: admins with?

[06/29/2007 03:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't know how to use photoshop

[06/29/2007 03:32:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: do they provide the psd?
[06/29/2007 03:35:58 PM] Robert Douglas: they give u psd only
[06/29/2007 03:36:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so u have to covnert to xhtml
[06/29/2007 03:36:08 PM] Robert Douglas: well
[06/29/2007 03:36:10 PM] Robert Douglas: it comes with html
[06/29/2007 03:36:12 PM] Robert Douglas: but their html code is ugly
[06/29/2007 03:36:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats fine, i'd rather have the psd at least
[06/29/2007 03:37:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i need something thats very modular, where content changes a lot depending on the section you are in, but still have the general template style

[06/29/2007 03:37:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the way it is not, all those sections will change when the user goes to a new section
[06/29/2007 03:38:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the About section isn't going to have a playlist or file information at the bottom, so those will be removed
[06/29/2007 03:39:39 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have that IE6 executable file?
[06/29/2007 03:39:43 PM] Robert Douglas: the standalone one
[06/29/2007 03:39:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/29/2007 03:40:12 PM] Robert Douglas: can u zip it up and upload it somewhere for me to download?
[06/29/2007 03:40:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta test something at work

[06/29/2007 03:51:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: netdrive sucks ass
[06/29/2007 03:51:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/29/2007 03:51:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should have vpn access
[06/29/2007 03:51:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: can we ask admins about that?
[06/29/2007 03:52:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll send another e-mail if i need to, with the research and questions for them
[06/29/2007 03:52:09 PM] Robert Douglas: we tried openvpn, but it wasnt every sable
[06/29/2007 03:52:17 PM] Robert Douglas: ever*
[06/29/2007 03:52:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: well there are other ones for linux we should try
[06/29/2007 03:53:05 PM] Robert Douglas: the server we run is a tad finicky about some of the advanced software
[06/29/2007 03:53:07 PM] Robert Douglas: certain things work
[06/29/2007 03:53:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example we will be able to use windows vpn to connect to it
[06/29/2007 03:54:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will look into it, but i think vpn access is the answer, net drive keeps a cache and if thats not turned off somehow we overwrite each others changes to the database
[06/29/2007 03:54:30 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/29/2007 03:54:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i was using openvpn before
[06/29/2007 03:54:51 PM] Robert Douglas: but it had some issues
[06/29/2007 03:55:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i can talk to the admins again about doing it
[06/29/2007 03:55:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: well we should just be able to use the windows one on the client computers, and that should be able to connect to a linux one on the server
[06/29/2007 03:55:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: like samba is a linux server for hosting files, but its compatible with windows networking
[06/29/2007 04:02:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: start using now

[06/29/2007 08:52:27 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking about writing a perl script to do the manual work for that
[06/29/2007 08:52:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: those updates?
[06/29/2007 08:53:03 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[06/29/2007 08:53:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: there should be something that can do it
[06/29/2007 08:53:40 PM] Robert Douglas: the logic is simple for it
[06/29/2007 08:53:49 PM] Robert Douglas: figure it would be a pretty easy thing to code
[06/29/2007 08:54:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do you need it in perl?
[06/29/2007 08:55:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i already coded a perl script to grab files and chmod them based on an input file
[06/29/2007 08:55:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[06/29/2007 08:55:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i was thinking about modifying that to actually do a find/replace

[07/02/2007 11:33:36 AM] Robert Douglas: that way when something is not received, we can double check that it was actually sent

[07/02/2007 01:16:18 PM] Robert Douglas: so instead of rewriting it, easier to just click forward for new msg

[07/02/2007 04:34:35 PM] Robert Douglas: and that is what?
[07/02/2007 04:35:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: just look at the one change i made
[07/02/2007 04:35:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: if they were at all intuitive they could have figure that out, by the very prospect be being ADMINS
[07/02/2007 04:36:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i shouldn't have to do their research for them, next time i will just send them a google search
[07/02/2007 04:36:29 PM] Robert Douglas: what change are you talking about?
[07/02/2007 04:36:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: see, its so minor, yet they mentioned it in their last response
[07/02/2007 04:37:00 PM] Robert Douglas: the lack of user?
[07/02/2007 04:37:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i changed the username on the second entry
[07/02/2007 04:37:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i change it from the previous user to docs
[07/02/2007 04:37:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: the user that needs to be used
[07/02/2007 04:37:40 PM] Robert Douglas: /etc/xinetd.d/svn2

[07/02/2007 04:37:44 PM] Robert Douglas: u have the user as svnadmin
[07/02/2007 04:37:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i sent the new change
[07/02/2007 04:37:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: just not
[07/02/2007 04:37:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: *just now
[07/02/2007 04:38:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its needs to be docs
[07/02/2007 04:38:17 PM] Robert Douglas: so u sent them the wrong config
[07/02/2007 04:38:21 PM] Robert Douglas: and complain that they didnt fix it?
[07/02/2007 04:38:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: right, so next time i will send them a google query and tell them to figure it out
[07/02/2007 04:38:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tried to be helpful, but its just delayed this process longer
[07/02/2007 04:39:00 PM] Robert Douglas: no, you will need to send the right config over
[07/02/2007 04:39:10 PM] Robert Douglas: how are they supposed to know the user you want?
[07/02/2007 04:39:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i changed it in the top one to match the account it applies to
[07/02/2007 04:39:46 PM] Robert Douglas: they were kind enogh to point out the username didnt exist
[07/02/2007 04:40:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but its fine, i'm not the admin, i don't have access to work out the bugs myself in half the time it takes for e-mails to fly back and forth, so next time i will send them a description and a search result, instead of doing the research myself
[07/02/2007 04:40:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just tried to be helpful, and its taken 2 days longer then it would have if i configured it myself
[07/02/2007 04:40:50 PM] Robert Douglas: this attitude is why you dont have access directly to the admins
[07/02/2007 04:41:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i can do things more efficiently in less time?
[07/02/2007 04:41:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: that attitude?
[07/02/2007 04:41:16 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[07/02/2007 04:41:18 PM] Robert Douglas: "next time i will send them a google query and tell them to figure it out"
[07/02/2007 04:41:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was fine with doing to research, and had i added it myself i would have found the error and corrected it instead of implementing it wrong
[07/02/2007 04:41:56 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but you know how it is supposed to be implemented, the admins dont know that
[07/02/2007 04:42:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so since its notmy job to conifgure it, why is my attitude wrong?
[07/02/2007 04:42:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm not gunna argue with u on it anymore
[07/02/2007 04:42:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm just telling u that this is why you arent directly talking to the admins
[07/02/2007 04:42:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: the admins knew everything that was wrong via there response, at least they could have corrected the path to svnserve
[07/02/2007 04:42:35 PM] Robert Douglas: just an fyi

[07/02/2007 05:58:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i think the SVN needs its' own forum
[07/02/2007 05:58:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[07/02/2007 05:59:06 PM] Robert Douglas: then a protocol on how to access docs, then one for webs, then one for adding users, etc...

[07/02/2007 06:55:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: eating
[07/02/2007 06:56:23 PM] Robert Douglas: is there a php function to get the location of a file?
[07/02/2007 06:56:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: the current file is __FILE__
[07/02/2007 06:57:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking that instead of having a config file
[07/02/2007 06:57:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i could just get the file based off of the structure
[07/02/2007 06:58:00 PM] Robert Douglas: instead ofdoing an include <?php include("/home/rps/public_html/_includes/boxes/why_rps.inc.php"); ?>
[07/02/2007 06:58:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would work
[07/02/2007 06:58:19 PM] Robert Douglas: just parse the location to pull out /home/rps/public_html/
[07/02/2007 06:59:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yep
[07/02/2007 07:01:43 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/02/2007 07:01:55 PM] Robert Douglas: itappears that the file constant sometimes returns the relative path
[07/02/2007 07:02:00 PM] Robert Douglas: and sometimes does absolute path
[07/02/2007 07:02:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is another way to do it
[07/02/2007 07:02:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: search google php current file
[07/02/2007 07:02:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i did and found it
[07/02/2007 07:02:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't remember if i used the command
[07/02/2007 07:03:12 PM] Robert Douglas: $PHP_SELF sound familiar?
[07/02/2007 07:15:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that could be it
[07/02/2007 07:19:08 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/02/2007 07:19:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking it might b e a tad quicker
[07/02/2007 07:19:17 PM] Robert Douglas: to just hard code the location
[07/02/2007 07:21:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: its more robust if you cardcode less
[07/02/2007 07:22:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: php self should work
[07/02/2007 07:22:56 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah,but u still need to do an streplace to remove everything after public_html/
[07/02/2007 07:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: just make a function for it
[07/02/2007 07:23:27 PM] Robert Douglas: but then u have to include that for every page
[07/02/2007 07:23:28 PM] Robert Douglas: like a config
[07/02/2007 07:23:32 PM] Robert Douglas: and i dont want that

[07/05/2007 12:23:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it finds all the php and txt files and allows you to download them?
[07/05/2007 12:24:47 PM] Robert Douglas: basically
[07/05/2007 12:25:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: with php files you know it will try to display them
[07/05/2007 12:25:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: in order to change that you have to change the headers
[07/05/2007 12:25:46 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[07/05/2007 12:26:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you can do it in htaccess, but you have to either turn off the php reader, or use a disposition
[07/05/2007 12:26:05 PM] Robert Douglas: it is gunna be for html,txt,or jpgs
[07/05/2007 12:26:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, well when downloading files i recommend using a disposition is the header field that its called
[07/05/2007 12:27:06 PM] Robert Douglas: never heard of that
[07/05/2007 12:27:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will force the download dialog to come up on the client every time
[07/05/2007 12:27:31 PM] Robert Douglas: this doesn't redirect anyone, it just links to the specific file
[07/05/2007 12:27:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://de.php.net/header)http://de.php.net/header
[07/05/2007 12:28:26 PM] Robert Douglas: this script basically acts as a fancy displayer for folders
[07/05/2007 12:28:33 PM] Robert Douglas: allowing you to set what you want to display
[07/05/2007 12:28:38 PM] Robert Douglas: based on file types
[07/05/2007 12:29:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah my script shows real nice folders and files
[07/05/2007 12:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i put filters on each modules so it only displays the files it should
[07/05/2007 12:29:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made lots of improvments on my script, you should take a lok at the code
[07/05/2007 12:29:58 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have a trimmed down version that does what i have?
[07/05/2007 12:31:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: trimmed down version?
[07/05/2007 12:32:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: it gets pretty bulky but you could trim it down, you can specify a folder and just have it display all the files in that folder
[07/05/2007 12:32:34 PM] Robert Douglas: well this does what i need, i think what u have is much more complex
[07/05/2007 12:32:38 PM] Robert Douglas: since u have so much attached to it
[07/05/2007 12:32:39 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[07/05/2007 12:32:48 PM] Robert Douglas: mine is pretty simple and doesnt do anything else
[07/05/2007 12:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: well yeah, i have it handles special media types
[07/05/2007 12:33:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like it shows thumbnails based on files extensions
[07/05/2007 12:33:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wrote a lot of smaller subroutines to make thumbnails and everything

[07/05/2007 12:36:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i fucking hate java for web scripting
[07/05/2007 12:36:15 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/05/2007 12:36:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: java sucks
[07/05/2007 12:36:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not a web language
[07/05/2007 12:36:32 PM] Robert Douglas: another intern here was wondering if u had any good references for doing it
[07/05/2007 12:37:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: its like a bulky application language with a terrible front end and it always comes with shitty application programmers
[07/05/2007 12:37:27 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/05/2007 12:37:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, he is using it to design a client side program
[07/05/2007 12:37:37 PM] Robert Douglas: not web based one
[07/05/2007 12:37:43 PM] Robert Douglas: but he needs to connect to a website, and just wondered how
[07/05/2007 12:37:53 PM] Robert Douglas: if u know of any decent reference guides send them over please

[07/05/2007 12:45:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are different ways to categorize the results from the database
[07/05/2007 12:46:02 PM] Robert Douglas: are u even stroing it in a db?
[07/05/2007 12:46:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have it acting similar to windows media player, so replace All with artist or album or genre
[07/05/2007 12:47:35 PM] Robert Douglas: none of it can play just yet tho right?
[07/05/2007 12:48:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: right now they are treated like regular downloads, so you can double click on the file and it will download it
[07/05/2007 12:49:00 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt work for me
[07/05/2007 12:49:07 PM] Robert Douglas: it also shows size is 0 bytes
[07/05/2007 12:49:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: double click the folder
[07/05/2007 12:49:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: then double clik a mp3 file
[07/05/2007 12:49:44 PM] Robert Douglas: ah, the ones i was going in didnt have any mp3s
[07/05/2007 12:50:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are lots of folders
[07/05/2007 12:50:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should show the folder icons
[07/05/2007 12:51:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Music/Aerosmith/Aerosmith/)http://www.bjcullinan.com/Share/Music/Aerosmith/Aerosmith/
[07/05/2007 12:52:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: same deal with the pictures section
[07/05/2007 12:52:25 PM] Robert Douglas: are u gunna link it to Amazon's api for album art?
[07/05/2007 12:52:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is categorizable and shows awesome thumbnails
[07/05/2007 12:52:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i do plan to use amazon api
[07/05/2007 12:53:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and ajax, since i made it so modular i can reload any section i want
[07/05/2007 12:53:40 PM] Robert Douglas: make sure u work on that GUI so it looks good
[07/05/2007 12:53:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when i make a folder tree, it will be a piece of cake to get the contents of a certain folder
[07/05/2007 12:54:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might have a friend design the gui
[07/05/2007 12:54:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it sucks because not many guis can do file listings
[07/05/2007 12:54:20 PM] Robert Douglas: we can have one of our designers do one really nice for just a little $$
[07/05/2007 12:54:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need something that looks good with lots of lists
[07/05/2007 12:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would pay a little money
[07/05/2007 12:54:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm willing to pay up to 80 dollars for a template
[07/05/2007 12:55:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i couldn't find anything on template monster
[07/05/2007 12:55:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: that looked good with a file list
[07/05/2007 12:55:28 PM] Robert Douglas: write up a list of your requirements
[07/05/2007 12:55:33 PM] Robert Douglas: provide as many examples as possible
[07/05/2007 12:55:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll review it
[07/05/2007 12:55:40 PM] Robert Douglas: and talk to our lead designer
[07/05/2007 12:55:52 PM] Robert Douglas: be sure to include examples of GUIs that u like
[07/05/2007 12:56:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool, i want other people to be able to use this site, maybe with different GUIs but i have it all plugging into a template so far
[07/05/2007 12:57:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i've made even the simplest processes into functions the code looks really clean
[07/05/2007 12:57:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i have a function for getExt
[07/05/2007 12:57:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: its like 3 lines of code, and it returns the part of the filename past the last . (period)
[07/05/2007 12:58:14 PM] Robert Douglas: do u use strrchr?
[07/05/2007 12:58:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: strrpos
[07/05/2007 12:58:50 PM] Robert Douglas: why not strrchr?
[07/05/2007 12:59:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i bet it would save a bit on code
[07/05/2007 12:59:10 PM] Robert Douglas: brb grabbing snack
[07/05/2007 12:59:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: same thing
[07/05/2007 12:59:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: looked it up it returns the last position
[07/05/2007 12:59:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: its just 3 lines because i set that to $start and then use a $length variable
[07/05/2007 01:00:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: just to make the substr shorter
[07/05/2007 01:00:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho, i'll put the code somewhere you can get to it later, and you can poke around
[07/05/2007 01:01:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually you can get to it now if you want to take a look
[07/05/2007 01:01:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/listing.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2F#_bjcullinan_)http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/listing.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2F#_bjcullinan_
[07/05/2007 01:01:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: the modules/pictures.php is the important stuff
[07/05/2007 01:04:44 PM] Robert Douglas: can i see ur code for the ext
[07/05/2007 01:04:51 PM] Robert Douglas: curious to see what parameters u used
[07/05/2007 01:05:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i think strrchr is better if u need to include the period with the file extension
[07/05/2007 01:06:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/filedetails.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2Finclude%2Ffileio.php)http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/filedetails.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2Finclude%2Ffileio.php
[07/05/2007 01:06:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: line 456
[07/05/2007 01:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope don't want . , it wouldn't match up with some of the other stuff i am doing
[07/05/2007 01:07:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i rarely need to remove the extention from a filename
[07/05/2007 01:07:23 PM] Robert Douglas: strrchr is a lot shorter
[07/05/2007 01:07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: it actually looks for the last period automatically
[07/05/2007 01:09:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah its the same thing you just usually do it all in one line
[07/05/2007 01:09:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it does
[07/05/2007 01:09:31 PM] Robert Douglas: substr($file, $start, strlen($file) - $start);
[07/05/2007 01:09:33 PM] Robert Douglas: automatically
[07/05/2007 01:10:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yews i forgot, substr returns the entire last part of the string if you don't specify a length
[07/05/2007 01:11:17 PM] Robert Douglas: $start = strrpos($file, '.') + 1; 
$ext = substr($file, $start, strlen($file) - $start); 
return strtolower($ext); 
 
$ext  =  strrchr($file,  "."); 
return strtolower($ext);
[07/05/2007 01:12:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i will use that instead
[07/05/2007 01:12:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i just learned about it about 30 mins ago lol
[07/05/2007 01:12:23 PM] Robert Douglas: didnt even know it existed
[07/05/2007 01:14:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but my script is nice because i don't have those functions like strchr, even though it is short, lying around all over the place
[07/05/2007 01:14:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: everything uses the getExt function
[07/05/2007 01:14:34 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[07/05/2007 01:14:38 PM] Robert Douglas: u have lots of good code
[07/05/2007 01:14:47 PM] Robert Douglas: but always better to reduce the code as much as possible
[07/05/2007 01:14:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: check out the pictures module
[07/05/2007 01:14:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: it does some tricky stuff
[07/05/2007 01:15:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but its all well commented
[07/05/2007 01:15:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the loader.php in includes
[07/05/2007 01:15:18 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/filedetails.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2Fmodules%2Fpictures.php)http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/filedetails.php?repname=Websites&path=%2Fbjcullinan%2Fmodules%2Fpictures.php
[07/05/2007 01:15:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: it loads the mime types off my linux filesystem
[07/05/2007 01:15:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes thats the link
[07/05/2007 01:15:43 PM] Robert Douglas: the websvn needs a light bg color
[07/05/2007 01:16:13 PM] Robert Douglas: instead of color cccccc or ccc, replace with fcfcfc
[07/05/2007 01:16:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i didn't write it remember, i need to work on the codepaster svn, then link it to mine but make it password safe
[07/05/2007 01:16:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but u should be able to modify the color output
[07/05/2007 01:16:50 PM] Robert Douglas: would be nice since u do a lot of php
[07/05/2007 01:18:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i think ur music program will be very nice
[07/05/2007 01:18:52 PM] Robert Douglas: once it is done
[07/05/2007 01:20:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it should be nice
[07/05/2007 01:20:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will also have my software file up, but it will just be the standard file print out
[07/05/2007 01:21:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like the thumbnails in the pictures section
[07/05/2007 01:21:51 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i'd still prolly start working on writing up a GUI
[07/05/2007 01:22:01 PM] Robert Douglas: that way u can have an overview of all ur features
[07/05/2007 01:22:23 PM] Robert Douglas: when u write up gui requirements, ti is like creating a business plan or porject overview, because everything u plan to do is listed inside the notes for what u want it to look like
[07/05/2007 01:22:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: also i just learned that image magic supports rotate, so i am going to do some tricky stuff to rotate the thumbnails and lay like 6 of them on top of eachother for the folder icon, just like windows media player does
[07/05/2007 01:24:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i will do that write up, this will give me good experience for when i do client projects
[07/05/2007 01:24:42 PM] Robert Douglas: the more pictures, detailes, and examples, the better end product will be
[07/05/2007 01:24:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[07/06/2007 12:28:22 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea if php has this functionality?
[07/06/2007 01:26:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have looked into that before
[07/06/2007 01:26:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you might be able to do it with cURL
[07/06/2007 01:27:07 PM] Robert Douglas: looks pretty complex, doesnt appear to be something already packaged
[07/06/2007 01:27:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i found an apache module that could be used
[07/06/2007 01:27:19 PM] Robert Douglas: mod_auth_smb
[07/06/2007 01:27:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i decided it wasnt worth the trouble

[07/06/2007 01:34:35 PM] Robert Douglas: very
[07/06/2007 01:39:58 PM] Robert Douglas: if u are ever looking at a test/quiz program, Moodle is really sweet
[07/06/2007 01:40:07 PM] Robert Douglas: hard to use at first, but when you get used to the setup, it is incredible

Current Time: 07-07-07 7:02 PM 
ETA: 3 hours
[07/07/2007 09:38:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: here for now whats up?
[07/07/2007 09:38:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i am using php includes
[07/07/2007 09:38:59 PM] Robert Douglas:  
<?php include("service_navigation.inc.php"); ?> 
<?php $bot=1; include("why_rps.inc.php"); $bot=0; ?> 
<?php include("hosting.inc.php"); ?>
[07/07/2007 09:39:13 PM] Robert Douglas: each of those included files does something if $bot is true
[07/07/2007 09:39:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i will only ever use bot 1 or 2 times
[07/07/2007 09:39:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/07/2007 09:39:55 PM] Robert Douglas: the problem i have, is that without the $bot=0, the value is always true
[07/07/2007 09:40:33 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, if i say  
<?php $bot=1; include("why_rps.inc.php");  ?> 
 
i don't want the anythting outside of that php code to know the value of $bot
[07/07/2007 09:40:43 PM] Robert Douglas: is there another way i can specify the value of $bot?
[07/07/2007 09:43:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i see, $bot is not local to that code inside the include and php brakets
[07/07/2007 09:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: there isn't really any other way to do it, if you want $bot to be true for the first include, it is going to be set for every other usage after that.
[07/07/2007 09:44:24 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4697)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4697

[07/07/2007 09:44:27 PM] Robert Douglas: r0x0r
[07/07/2007 09:44:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: if it is set to true somewhere else you could use unset($bot);
[07/07/2007 09:45:42 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, didnt think there was another way to declare the variable
[07/07/2007 09:46:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, if you specify it like that it becomes global
[07/07/2007 09:46:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could even print out $GLOBALS anywhere else in the script and see that $bot was defined
[07/07/2007 09:46:55 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that's the problems
[07/07/2007 09:46:58 PM] Robert Douglas: problem
[07/07/2007 09:48:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you have $bot = something else somewhere else in the script then use unset()
[07/07/2007 09:48:32 PM] Robert Douglas: in this situation,it would just be like setting it to false after the include
[07/07/2007 09:48:37 PM] Robert Douglas: so it wont help me much :(
[07/07/2007 09:49:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/07/2007 09:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: however if you made that bottom part a function
[07/07/2007 09:49:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: then the $bot variable would be local to that function
[07/07/2007 09:49:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't think that is going to help at all
[07/07/2007 09:51:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i would have to define a function that declares that bot variable
[07/07/2007 09:51:18 PM] Robert Douglas: then incldues the file
[07/07/2007 09:51:24 PM] Robert Douglas: then execute the function
[07/07/2007 09:57:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll have to look into the azrn sorting tomorrow
[07/07/2007 09:57:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought i changed the output on the dev server but i am not sure what i changed
[07/07/2007 10:01:38 PM] Robert Douglas: ok thx

[07/08/2007 08:38:26 PM] Robert Douglas: any luck with azrn?
[07/08/2007 08:42:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what order is it supposed to be?
[07/08/2007 08:42:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: by number?
[07/08/2007 08:42:58 PM] Robert Douglas: correct
[07/08/2007 08:43:03 PM] Robert Douglas: all current members via number
[07/08/2007 08:43:08 PM] Robert Douglas: then all expired members via number
[07/08/2007 08:43:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what it is currently
[07/08/2007 08:44:00 PM] Robert Douglas: according to the screenshot, that's not how it is workring tho
[07/08/2007 08:45:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: then there is something out of my control
[07/08/2007 08:45:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have the order on the query
[07/08/2007 08:45:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is something wrong with the database
[07/08/2007 08:45:59 PM] Robert Douglas: idunno why the script messed up the DB
[07/08/2007 08:46:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is expiration date descending and number ascending
[07/08/2007 08:46:07 PM] Robert Douglas: but it needs to be corrected to make sure nothing bad happens
[07/08/2007 08:46:17 PM] Robert Douglas: because i dont want client to run into same issue
[07/08/2007 08:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: what scipt messed up the database?
[07/08/2007 08:46:37 PM] Robert Douglas: your script is the onyl one that accesses it
[07/08/2007 08:46:43 PM] Robert Douglas: if something is wrong with the DB
[07/08/2007 08:46:47 PM] Robert Douglas: then it is fault of the script...
[07/08/2007 08:47:03 PM] Robert Douglas: it's not working the way it is supposed to be working, it needs to be fixed
[07/08/2007 08:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: well that screen shot isn't helping at all, i need to see dates
[07/08/2007 08:49:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is sorting by date, then by number
[07/08/2007 08:49:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if the expiration date is the same, then the numbers will be sequential
[07/08/2007 08:50:10 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/

[07/08/2007 08:51:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that produces expected result
[07/08/2007 08:51:46 PM] Robert Douglas: you understand what the issue is, correct?
[07/08/2007 08:52:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: the date on the green one is 08/01/2008
[07/08/2007 08:52:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of 31
[07/08/2007 08:52:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: like all the other ones
[07/08/2007 08:52:32 PM] Robert Douglas: it
[07/08/2007 08:52:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it is not supposed to be int he middle like that
[07/08/2007 08:52:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: it sorts by date first so all the expired ones will show up together
[07/08/2007 08:52:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: then it sorts by number'
[07/08/2007 08:53:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it sorts by date so all the expired ones show up together, then it sorts by number
[07/08/2007 08:53:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: if its not supposed to be in the middle, then it is not supposed to have that date
[07/08/2007 08:53:56 PM] Robert Douglas: well, it got past your script
[07/08/2007 08:54:07 PM] Robert Douglas: and the client didnt manually access the DB
[07/08/2007 08:54:19 PM] Robert Douglas: if the DB breaks when you do something, you need to make sure the user cant do that something
[07/08/2007 08:54:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the date is wrong?
[07/08/2007 08:55:06 PM] Robert Douglas: no, the script should be able to handle all dates
[07/08/2007 08:55:32 PM] Robert Douglas: if there is a restriction, then u need to make sure that u cant enter data that casues the restriction
[07/08/2007 08:55:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok you are missing the point, you can only order it in so many ways
[07/08/2007 08:55:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you want it to be ordered by the expiration or by the number?
[07/08/2007 08:56:20 PM] Robert Douglas: Merlin says: 
all current members via number 
Merlin says: 
then all expired members via number
[07/08/2007 08:56:53 PM] Robert Douglas: the unpaid and pending can be above the current ones
[07/08/2007 08:57:01 PM] Robert Douglas: but still must be ordered in the same way via number
[07/08/2007 08:57:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes and that green one will expire sooner then the ones above it
[07/08/2007 08:57:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and after the ones below it
[07/08/2007 08:57:49 PM] Robert Douglas: ok

[07/11/2007 02:02:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: is mail installed on the azrn website?
[07/11/2007 02:07:04 PM] Robert Douglas: hey
[07/11/2007 02:07:17 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure, would that show up on the phpinfo page?
[07/11/2007 02:08:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have sent mail with the iterator on the live site
[07/11/2007 02:08:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually maybe we haven't
[07/11/2007 02:09:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i tested it on the dev site and it didnt send me an email
[07/11/2007 02:09:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the mail class is throwing an error
[07/11/2007 02:09:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: which tells me its not my script
[07/11/2007 02:10:11 PM] Robert Douglas: right, but you are still responsible because you made the decision to use the mail class
[07/11/2007 02:10:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if mail isn't installed that would explain why it isn't sending
[07/11/2007 02:10:38 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/simple-php-contact-form/)http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/simple-php-contact-form/
[07/11/2007 02:10:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: mail is a php command
[07/11/2007 02:10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: that code right their works without issue
[07/11/2007 02:11:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i thought u were talking about the huge class file that u include in order to send mail
[07/11/2007 02:11:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that class is just a simple interface for using the mail function
[07/11/2007 02:11:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i know the class works
[07/11/2007 02:11:47 PM] Robert Douglas: the mail() function in php is working
[07/11/2007 02:12:00 PM] Robert Douglas: either the class you are using to use the mail() function isn't working
[07/11/2007 02:12:11 PM] Robert Douglas: or the code you use to use the class that uses the mail() function inst working
[07/11/2007 02:12:42 PM] Robert Douglas: know what i mean?
[07/11/2007 02:13:00 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never used the one you're using, so i dunno exactly how it works
[07/11/2007 02:13:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it works with the iterator
[07/11/2007 02:14:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see any reason why it wouldn't work on the other page
[07/11/2007 02:14:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: you said you tested it on the dev account?
[07/11/2007 02:14:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i think u implemented a fairly complex method for email
[07/11/2007 02:14:24 PM] Robert Douglas: where you could have simply used the mail() function
[07/11/2007 02:14:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm sure what u did was much more robust 
[07/11/2007 02:16:29 PM] Robert Douglas: let me test it all again
[07/11/2007 02:18:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: worked on the dev account
[07/11/2007 02:18:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: not my script
[07/11/2007 02:19:03 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like the azrn site says "Language string failed to load: instantiate "
[07/11/2007 02:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 02:19:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it can't find the language file to describe the error
[07/11/2007 02:19:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i traced it back to where it sends the mail
[07/11/2007 02:20:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: using the mail function
[07/11/2007 02:20:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats where it is throwing the error
[07/11/2007 02:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it works on the dev site
[07/11/2007 02:20:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so something is wrong with php mail
[07/11/2007 02:20:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: which means the iterator isn't going to work either
[07/11/2007 02:21:56 PM] Robert Douglas: IN CLASS.PHPLISTMAILER:PHP LINE #4 change this: 
 
require( $GLOBALS"coderoot"] . "phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php"); 
FOR: 
require( $GLOBALS["coderoot"] . "/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php"); 
[07/11/2007 02:22:24 PM] Robert Douglas: or
[07/11/2007 02:22:24 PM] Robert Douglas: add a forward slash " / " on line 48 in the config.php file 
 
Code: 
$pageroot = '/';

[07/11/2007 02:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is this now?
[07/11/2007 02:23:48 PM] Robert Douglas: that's a suggested fix to the config to fix the issue
[07/11/2007 02:24:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: that must be another script that uses phpmailer, because its a popular class i have been using for years
[07/11/2007 02:25:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not using a config file to include it like that
[07/11/2007 02:25:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: the class is being loaded
[07/11/2007 02:25:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: its something wrong with the mail function
[07/11/2007 02:25:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you try a phpinfo?
[07/11/2007 02:26:43 PM] Robert Douglas: no, is there any way u can do that and see if u can find anything?
[07/11/2007 02:26:57 PM] Robert Douglas: when u include the class.phpmailer.php file, maybe you could put a beginning forward flash
[07/11/2007 02:27:00 PM] Robert Douglas: forwardslash
[07/11/2007 02:27:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats just refering to the script in the local directory, i know the script is being loaded properly because it uses it to throw that error
[07/11/2007 02:28:29 PM] Robert Douglas: why do you have it using that class? why not simple using mail()
[07/11/2007 02:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i found the problem
[07/11/2007 02:33:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and changing the class would not have helped
[07/11/2007 02:33:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: php is using sendmail instead of just mail
[07/11/2007 02:34:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'm not sure it is going to work
[07/11/2007 02:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am still not getting the e-mail
[07/11/2007 02:35:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the error is gone
[07/11/2007 02:35:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so this problem is beyond me
[07/11/2007 02:35:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: why aren't they using our server for the live site?
[07/11/2007 02:42:38 PM] Robert Douglas: they already paid for yahoo
[07/11/2007 02:43:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: well we have another option
[07/11/2007 02:44:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: we can use their smtp account to send mail
[07/11/2007 02:44:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but other then that there is nothing else i can do
[07/11/2007 02:44:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats a server side problem
[07/11/2007 02:44:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: we know it works on our servers and with the sendmail program it is still not working
[07/11/2007 02:44:35 PM] Robert Douglas: so ur saying if I create a test page using mail() it wont work?
[07/11/2007 02:44:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 02:45:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: the php info shows that it is using sendmail but i don't see any other information about the mail setup
[07/11/2007 02:45:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you want to try your test page let me know
[07/11/2007 02:46:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i doubt it will work, if it does then i will implement your script
[07/11/2007 02:46:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure that it is a server side problem though
[07/11/2007 02:46:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: we might have to contact yahoo
[07/11/2007 02:46:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: or use the smtp mail
[07/11/2007 02:47:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: which also comes with the php mailer script
[07/11/2007 02:49:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll be back on later.  The repeated number error is going to have to wait until i have a better connection
[07/11/2007 02:50:02 PM] Robert Douglas: ok np about repeats
[07/11/2007 02:50:08 PM] Robert Douglas: but i'd really like to sort out the mail issue
[07/11/2007 02:50:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i uploaded a test mail() script
[07/11/2007 02:51:31 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/mailtest.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/mailtest.php
[07/11/2007 02:51:55 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like it works, but waiting for email to come back 2 me
[07/11/2007 02:52:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it doesn't show any errors
[07/11/2007 02:53:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it should return a false
[07/11/2007 02:53:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: do a var_dump()
[07/11/2007 02:53:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and put the email function inside
[07/11/2007 02:53:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it was the same case with the current script
[07/11/2007 02:53:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it shows it worked, but it never came in
[07/11/2007 02:53:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: gmail or cox
[07/11/2007 02:53:39 PM] Robert Douglas: vardump(mail( $to, $subject, $message, $headers )); 

[07/11/2007 02:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tested on both
[07/11/2007 02:53:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/11/2007 02:53:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: var_dump
[07/11/2007 02:53:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: underscore
[07/11/2007 02:54:01 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/mailtest.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/mailtest.php
[07/11/2007 02:54:25 PM] Robert Douglas: returns false
[07/11/2007 02:54:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i think that means there is an error
[07/11/2007 02:54:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: should return true
[07/11/2007 02:55:02 PM] Robert Douglas: u r right
[07/11/2007 02:55:05 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/mailtest.php)http://www.rp-s.com/mailtest.php
[07/11/2007 02:55:07 PM] Robert Douglas: that returns true
[07/11/2007 02:55:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so next step would be to either contact yahoo about the issue, or use smtp mail
[07/11/2007 02:55:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: do they have an account we could use smtp
[07/11/2007 02:55:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yahoo should have it too
[07/11/2007 02:56:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm startying to think we just give them free hosting or something
[07/11/2007 02:56:12 PM] Robert Douglas: because yahoo is a bitch to deal with
[07/11/2007 02:56:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about just free mail hosting?
[07/11/2007 02:56:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah they are
[07/11/2007 02:56:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could just set up a like azrn@rp-s.com
[07/11/2007 02:56:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: they would never see that e-mail address anyways
[07/11/2007 02:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: because the headers are set to their azradiologyrn@yahoo.com
[07/11/2007 02:58:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: its up to you.  i'll be back a little later. call me if you make a decision
[07/11/2007 02:58:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe let the client know about the issue
[07/11/2007 02:58:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: that its not our fault
[07/11/2007 02:59:55 PM] Robert Douglas: ok thx
[07/11/2007 03:05:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: bbl
[07/11/2007 03:05:29 PM] Robert Douglas: u here for a sec
[07/11/2007 03:05:33 PM] Robert Douglas: have an admin type question
[07/11/2007 03:05:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: barely the signal is crapping out on me
[07/11/2007 03:05:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: go ahead
[07/11/2007 03:05:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i installed apache, then installed php and mysql
[07/11/2007 03:05:52 PM] Robert Douglas: but all php pages show up as html instead of php
[07/11/2007 03:06:01 PM] Robert Douglas: do i have to add something to the http conf?

[07/11/2007 07:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you done with the date thing?
[07/11/2007 07:17:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yuip
[07/11/2007 07:17:52 PM] Robert Douglas: all working
[07/11/2007 07:17:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i added the member numbernow too
[07/11/2007 07:18:11 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont think it checks the number that was generated to make sure it doesnt exist
[07/11/2007 07:18:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: using the getID function?
[07/11/2007 07:18:25 PM] Robert Douglas: used $number
[07/11/2007 07:18:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'll take a look
[07/11/2007 07:21:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we want it to continue couting at 6000 right?
[07/11/2007 07:21:36 PM] Robert Douglas: no, i think it is in the 600s right now
[07/11/2007 07:22:08 PM] Robert Douglas: if the stupid client keptit sorted by member number, it would be ez to find out
[07/11/2007 07:22:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[07/11/2007 07:29:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright it checks if a number is already taken
[07/11/2007 07:29:31 PM] Robert Douglas: ajndif it is, it generates a new one, right?
[07/11/2007 07:29:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 07:29:42 PM] Robert Douglas: or adds 1 to it basically 
[07/11/2007 07:29:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: it starts now at 600 exactly
[07/11/2007 07:29:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 07:30:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and by submitting that it then says 601
[07/11/2007 07:31:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and as far as the iterator goes, if you look it shows my transaction on the dev account, you probably just sent payment to the rps dev account and the constants.php still have my dev account in it

[07/11/2007 07:35:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 07:35:26 PM] Robert Douglas: how does it know to talk to the azrn paypal account though
[07/11/2007 07:35:31 PM] Robert Douglas: is that what is setup?
[07/11/2007 07:35:43 PM] Robert Douglas: the api account 
[07/11/2007 07:35:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses those constants to "log into" paypal and get the azrn info
[07/11/2007 07:35:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: the dev site has different constants
[07/11/2007 07:36:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the ones for my dev account
[07/11/2007 07:36:17 PM] Robert Douglas: the dev login info though is something that was setup for AZRN only correct?
[07/11/2007 07:36:26 PM] Robert Douglas: it isnt something RPS owns/controls
[07/11/2007 07:36:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: we set up a dev on paypal for rps to use
[07/11/2007 07:37:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the one that azrn is for the live site, the constants that you just listed
[07/11/2007 07:37:25 PM] Robert Douglas: how can we verify that it is setup correctly?
[07/11/2007 07:37:34 PM] Robert Douglas: like the email that it is setup under
[07/11/2007 07:38:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it works on the dev account, so since we are using constants that are set up for the azrn account it will work for transactions on the azrn paypal account
[07/11/2007 07:38:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: paypal specifies those constants
[07/11/2007 07:38:58 PM] Robert Douglas: but where did you get the constants from? did u log into the azrn paypal account?
[07/11/2007 07:39:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 07:39:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is correct
[07/11/2007 07:39:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is under API Access in the settings for paypal accounts
[07/11/2007 07:39:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then NVP
[07/11/2007 07:39:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: name value pair
[07/11/2007 07:40:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats where the current constants are specified
[07/11/2007 07:41:29 PM] Robert Douglas: im gunna log in
[07/11/2007 07:41:38 PM] Robert Douglas: because i have a feeling that the PP account isnt the same
[07/11/2007 07:41:43 PM] Robert Douglas: since they had an issue with their PP account
[07/11/2007 07:41:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should send them money and test if it works
[07/11/2007 07:42:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: just don't upload the dev constants onto the live azrn site
[07/11/2007 07:42:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you were right about any type of account being able to use the api access
[07/11/2007 07:43:40 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, got it
[07/11/2007 07:43:51 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, apparently yahoo doesnt support crons
[07/11/2007 07:44:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm going to check on those transactions
[07/11/2007 07:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: that you said didn't go through
[07/11/2007 07:44:35 PM] Robert Douglas: we have to manually run the Iteratop script
[07/11/2007 07:44:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[07/11/2007 07:45:27 PM] Robert Douglas: after each new member is added, maybe we have it setup so it runs the Iterator
[07/11/2007 07:46:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would work but what would the client see?
[07/11/2007 07:46:32 PM] Robert Douglas: it would just execute the code and not display anything extra
[07/11/2007 07:46:36 PM] Robert Douglas: we can just have it hide the output
[07/11/2007 07:46:41 PM] Robert Douglas: or not output anything from the Iterator
[07/11/2007 07:47:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: the status won't show as "cleared or confirmed" imediately though
[07/11/2007 07:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i just take that check off and assume all transactions are valid?
[07/11/2007 07:48:05 PM] Robert Douglas: no, because the way you check if they are valid, is if they click the submit button to submit their info
[07/11/2007 07:48:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: it does check for the right amount of payment
[07/11/2007 07:48:16 PM] Robert Douglas: so anyone can hit submit and submit their info, but not continue to the PPpage
[07/11/2007 07:48:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean the transaction will show up only after they use paypal
[07/11/2007 07:49:09 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/11/2007 07:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only condition it would not work is if they call paypal and cancel the transaction
[07/11/2007 07:49:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so once htey use paypal, we have them redirect to a page that runs the Iterator?
[07/11/2007 07:49:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: then it would increment their membership but not be a status "confirmed"
[07/11/2007 07:49:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/11/2007 07:50:03 PM] Robert Douglas: so they submit their info
[07/11/2007 07:50:11 PM] Robert Douglas: then they are added in under a status of pending
[07/11/2007 07:50:12 PM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[07/11/2007 07:50:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/11/2007 07:50:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it needs to be rewritten with that uniq product id like we figured out
[07/11/2007 07:50:37 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that might be a good idea
[07/11/2007 07:50:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that will have to wait until i get a better internet connection
[07/11/2007 07:50:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i am suprised that PP doesnt have that in their example files
[07/11/2007 07:51:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: the example files fucking suck
[07/11/2007 07:51:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: they completely lack documentation
[07/11/2007 07:51:20 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be product ID, and price, because we dont want someone to spoof it using a set product id and a price of only like $1 lol
[07/11/2007 07:51:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: the entire dev site has terrible documentation
[07/11/2007 07:51:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah the script will be able to check for price
[07/11/2007 07:51:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: it does that now
[07/11/2007 07:51:56 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[07/11/2007 07:52:01 PM] Robert Douglas: but we wont care about the first/last name
[07/11/2007 07:52:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/11/2007 07:52:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the status of the transaction still poses an issue
[07/11/2007 07:52:21 PM] Robert Douglas: someone might sign up under Bobby Douglas, but their CC info with paypal says Robert Douglas
[07/11/2007 07:52:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: even with that method
[07/11/2007 07:53:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: other sites must use a cron because the status of the transaction is "unverified" until 3 to 4 days later
[07/11/2007 07:53:22 PM] Robert Douglas: modernbill doesnt use a cron
[07/11/2007 07:53:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless the user already has money in their pp acount
[07/11/2007 07:53:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what status does the script check?
[07/11/2007 07:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if it doesn't wait for it to be verified?
[07/11/2007 07:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: or confirmed?
[07/11/2007 07:54:26 PM] Robert Douglas: ur saying if they pay via echeck or bank transfer that doesnt automatically process
[07/11/2007 07:54:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: it does not set the status to confirmed imediately yes
[07/11/2007 07:55:00 PM] Robert Douglas: that is a very good question
[07/11/2007 07:55:07 PM] Robert Douglas: withotu a cron i dont see how it is possible
[07/11/2007 07:55:13 PM] Robert Douglas: but maybe MB doesnt allow those pmt options
[07/11/2007 07:58:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is possible that it assumes the status is completed, and then check for a refund or cancelation later
[07/11/2007 07:58:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think that would happen because of the spammers that deal with hosts
[07/11/2007 07:59:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could try looking in the forum, but its never been very helpful
[07/11/2007 08:00:23 PM] Robert Douglas: u might want to post int he forum
[07/11/2007 08:00:23 PM] Robert Douglas: specially asking if you arent using a cron
[07/11/2007 08:00:23 PM] Robert Douglas: how do u obtain the info
[07/11/2007 08:00:43 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe PP sends a message to modernbill automatically
[07/11/2007 08:01:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah well i g2g for now

[07/16/2007 12:38:13 PM] Robert Douglas: about AZRN, were u going to try and redo the paypal stuff so that it works using that new idea?
[07/16/2007 12:38:41 PM] Robert Douglas: also, alex and i finished up most of the text for the site last weekend: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/new.php)http://www.rp-s.com/new.php
[07/16/2007 12:39:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: the paypal thing will take a while
[07/16/2007 12:39:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: why don't we do that one and the jambonie one together
[07/16/2007 12:39:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought they were supposed to give you the go ahead soon for the jambonie store
[07/16/2007 12:42:32 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, jambo met with an investor this morning
[07/16/2007 12:42:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: sony invest?
[07/16/2007 12:43:02 PM] Robert Douglas: nah, different person, someone locally
[07/16/2007 12:43:40 PM] Robert Douglas: so right now with AZRN, the only way for the PayPal stuff to work is if the first and last name on PP account or credit card are the same as the first and last name of the member?
[07/16/2007 12:48:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/16/2007 12:48:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: because thats how it looks it up
[07/16/2007 12:49:24 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/16/2007 12:49:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tried using their sample api to look stuff up by transaction number and even that didn't work, so i imagine there is at least a full day of debugging to get it to work with a completely different system
[07/16/2007 12:49:52 PM] Robert Douglas: any chance u can get this working soon?
[07/16/2007 12:49:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and quite frankly i'm pretty fucking tired of this project
[07/16/2007 12:50:15 PM] Robert Douglas: for example, Deborah Kirkpatrick is someone's name, but as a member, her name is Debbi Kirkpatrick
[07/16/2007 12:50:41 PM] Robert Douglas: the program wont pick up the transaction because Debbi Kirkpatrick did not make the purchase, however, Deborah Kirkpatrick did
[07/16/2007 12:50:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: then that person can contact the azrn chick
[07/16/2007 12:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and get her to manually do it
[07/16/2007 12:51:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be more worth the time and money for me
[07/16/2007 12:51:13 PM] Robert Douglas: once this program is working compeltely, it will be a project i'd love to drop and forget about
[07/16/2007 12:51:58 PM] Robert Douglas: there isn't a button for the admin to active an account that has paid
[07/16/2007 12:52:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: using the add 1 year activates it
[07/16/2007 12:52:50 PM] Robert Douglas: but it adds an additional yr onto the member
[07/16/2007 12:52:53 PM] Robert Douglas: then u have to decrease it
[07/16/2007 12:53:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that still never solves the problem of not being able to use a cron
[07/16/2007 12:53:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so member still can't get their expiration e-mails
[07/16/2007 12:53:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll setup a cron from our end
[07/16/2007 12:54:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats bullshit, they need to be paying us instead of yahoo
[07/16/2007 12:54:08 PM] Robert Douglas: the cron stuff we dont have to worry about
[07/16/2007 12:54:19 PM] Robert Douglas: not all of our clients will pay us for hsoting
[07/16/2007 12:54:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: then they don't deserve to use our servers processors
[07/16/2007 12:55:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to modify the protocol
[07/16/2007 12:55:02 PM] Robert Douglas: this particular client already paid for hosting with yahoo, found out they couldnt build their membership db with yahoo, so had a web design company do it
[07/16/2007 12:55:11 PM] Robert Douglas: either way, we need to get the payment stuff working
[07/16/2007 12:55:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well its going to have to wait until i can stop using remote desktop to develope
[07/16/2007 12:56:01 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe u could change it so it checks for last name and timestamp for now?
[07/16/2007 12:56:13 PM] Robert Douglas: that will be better than what it does right now, at least until it can be redeveloped
[07/16/2007 12:56:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i can do last name
[07/16/2007 12:57:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have been spending more time on this project then it is worth, would it be such a shame if we dropped the client now?

[07/16/2007 12:59:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and how would i check them timestamp if that only exists in paypal
[07/16/2007 12:59:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is their website going to know what time it was submitted
[07/16/2007 12:59:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it could be any time
[07/16/2007 12:59:51 PM] Robert Douglas: when someone is added to the DB, rec the time the suer was added
[07/16/2007 01:00:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i compare our timestamp with the time that they pay?
[07/16/2007 01:00:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: they could make a payment at any time
[07/16/2007 01:01:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the api i am using i believe requires at least 2 fields to look something up
[07/16/2007 01:02:19 PM] Robert Douglas: we asusme that once you submit your application, u go to the payment page
[07/16/2007 01:02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: so as long as it is within X number of minutes, maybe 20 minutes is a good number, then it is more likely to be that person
[07/16/2007 01:03:02 PM] Robert Douglas: this logic would work better than what is currently in place
[07/16/2007 01:04:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: logically if something goes wrong they would contact the person the website is about
[07/16/2007 01:04:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no other system that would be easy or quicki to implement
[07/16/2007 01:04:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so far i have been completely disappointed with paypal's documentation
[07/16/2007 01:05:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will be able to work on the new system in a few weeks, then we will have it all worked out so we can use it on the jambonie website
[07/16/2007 01:06:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: until then they are just going to have to suck it up and manually change it
[07/16/2007 01:06:35 PM] Robert Douglas: client cant wait another few weeks, they are pushing something big this week, and need their website working 100%
[07/16/2007 01:07:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: well that sucks
[07/16/2007 01:10:07 PM] Robert Douglas: so what can u do in the mean time to fix this?
[07/16/2007 01:10:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: the last name thing is an easy change, the timestamp isn't going to work any better
[07/16/2007 01:11:36 PM] Robert Douglas: the timestamp will fix the issue with anyone that has the same last name as another member
[07/16/2007 01:12:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah unless the user switches to another window or leaves their desk for a half an hour and then comes back and makes the payment
[07/16/2007 01:12:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you come back to me and complain some more about it
[07/16/2007 01:13:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i could spend 4 hours on it every 4 days for the next 2 weeks and then spend 8 hours on it two weeks from now, or i could tell you that the client will have to wait and only spend 8 hours on it 2 weeks from now
[07/16/2007 01:14:49 PM] Robert Douglas: client cant wait 2 weeks
[07/16/2007 01:15:00 PM] Robert Douglas: if u dont have time to do it, we're gunna have to pay someone else to do it
[07/16/2007 01:15:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine with me
[07/16/2007 01:15:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not like i was paid for this project anyways
[07/16/2007 01:15:50 PM] Robert Douglas: you'll get the difference of whatever it costs us to find someone to finish this up
[07/16/2007 01:15:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: just don't let that someone else encrypt their code like fucking modern bill
[07/16/2007 01:15:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i have a friend that might be able to finish it for pretty cheap
[07/16/2007 01:16:04 PM] Robert Douglas: yeha np
[07/16/2007 01:16:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: if they get it working better then i have it now, more power to them, i would cost a lot more to the company to be spending 20 more hours on this anyways
[07/16/2007 01:17:09 PM] Robert Douglas: someone who knows paypal well should be able to do it in a couple hours
[07/16/2007 01:17:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i know this is the first time u used PP, i used it awhile ago and it took forever to get something to work
[07/16/2007 01:17:34 PM] Robert Douglas: PP has changed a lot from the last time i tried it 
[07/16/2007 01:17:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish that were me, but by the time jambonie makes their next move hopefully i will have the code i need

[07/16/2007 02:23:43 PM] Robert Douglas: cause i finally figured it out
[07/16/2007 02:24:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[07/16/2007 02:24:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: its used in perl
[07/16/2007 02:24:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is it called in php?
[07/16/2007 02:24:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: how does it work?
[07/16/2007 02:24:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought i tried it and it didn't work
[07/16/2007 02:24:40 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, when you use it, you can echo html, and whenever you use a php variable, it will echo the php variable too
[07/16/2007 02:24:53 PM] Robert Douglas: you have a beginning and ending statement
[07/16/2007 02:24:57 PM] Robert Douglas: anything inside of those >>>>s
[07/16/2007 02:25:04 PM] Robert Douglas: will echo all html and all php variables
[07/16/2007 02:25:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats cool
[07/16/2007 02:25:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yea -_-
[07/16/2007 02:32:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm uploading cerberus now
[07/16/2007 02:37:13 PM] Robert Douglas: when u are logged in as root and run mysql
[07/16/2007 02:37:20 PM] Robert Douglas: do u know how to run an sql script?
[07/16/2007 02:37:36 PM] Robert Douglas: if phpmyadmin is installed, u can execture the sql script uisng that
[07/16/2007 02:37:41 PM] Robert Douglas: but what if u are logged in at mysql?
[07/16/2007 02:39:43 PM] Robert Douglas: mysql -p -h localhost srch < search.sql
[07/16/2007 02:39:43 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe that will work
[07/16/2007 02:39:43 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/16/2007 02:41:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/16/2007 02:41:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: or log into mysql
[07/16/2007 02:41:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: mysql -u root -p
[07/16/2007 02:41:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: then enter the password
[07/16/2007 02:42:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but to actually run it i am not sure, i know there is stuff for importing tables
[07/16/2007 03:16:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really look forward to hiring a hot secretary
[07/16/2007 03:27:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know man this cerberus looks really robust
[07/16/2007 03:27:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think if we use this, we should use all of it
[07/16/2007 03:27:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: why don't we want to have e-mail support for customers?
[07/16/2007 03:38:39 PM] Robert Douglas: we want our KB to be completely separate from everything else
[07/16/2007 03:38:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i found out we're running mysql 4.0
[07/16/2007 03:39:06 PM] Robert Douglas: and the db i'm trying to import is 5.0
[07/16/2007 03:39:07 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/16/2007 03:47:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the kb can be seperate and still provide e-mail support
[07/16/2007 03:49:38 PM] Robert Douglas: the kb is going to use a trimmed down version of the DB
[07/16/2007 03:49:47 PM] Robert Douglas: so emails and such won't be part of it
[07/16/2007 03:50:02 PM] Robert Douglas: we already have cerberus running on one location of the site
[07/16/2007 03:50:09 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont wantt he KB tied to that
[07/16/2007 04:23:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like more of a pain in the ass then it is worth
[07/16/2007 04:23:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we already had cerberus running then what do we need another one for?
[07/16/2007 04:24:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think cerberus is the option we are looking for
[07/16/2007 04:24:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't understand the objective we are trying to reach
[07/16/2007 04:25:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: cerberus looks pretty integrated, not modular, parts of the system can't just be removed
[07/16/2007 04:27:17 PM] Robert Douglas: we need a knowledgebase that can integrate into our website
[07/16/2007 04:49:36 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want it to be loaded with extra crap

[07/16/2007 06:10:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you said we already have cerberus running, isn't that for our website?
[07/16/2007 06:10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: that's just to handle e-mail, and we might ditch it soon
[07/16/2007 06:11:00 PM] Robert Douglas: or replace it for something else
[07/16/2007 06:11:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should replace it with the whole package
[07/16/2007 06:11:15 PM] Robert Douglas: if we keep them together, then we will always have extra information
[07/16/2007 06:11:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure cerberus has options for what articles to display
[07/16/2007 06:11:42 PM] Robert Douglas: sugar has a KB integrated into it, but we dont want the KB to be integrated
[07/16/2007 06:11:52 PM] Robert Douglas: yes it does, the cerberus KB is pretty nice
[07/16/2007 06:12:08 PM] Robert Douglas: but the problem is that it comes bloated with extras that are completely unrelated to a KB
[07/16/2007 06:14:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have always thought that when it comes to scripting languages, its easier to do something yourself then pick apart someone else's software
[07/16/2007 06:15:13 PM] Robert Douglas: it depends, for common software, it is better to take someone else's script and modify that
[07/16/2007 06:15:21 PM] Robert Douglas: no reason to reinvent the wheel
[07/16/2007 06:15:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: true
[07/16/2007 06:15:30 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why we're not building sugar
[07/16/2007 06:15:34 PM] Robert Douglas: why we didnt build our own forum
[07/16/2007 06:15:39 PM] Robert Douglas: and why we use xcart
[07/16/2007 06:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you aren't asking my to completely remove sections of sugar or the forum
[07/16/2007 06:16:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: sugar actually allows admin panels to remove sections which is genius
[07/16/2007 06:16:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and implementing a skin in xcart is one thing, but i would have no idea where to start with this KB
[07/16/2007 06:16:41 PM] Robert Douglas: the goal is to find a KB, if we use Cerberus, then we have to trim it down
[07/16/2007 06:17:01 PM] Robert Douglas: we can use any KB
[07/16/2007 06:17:08 PM] Robert Douglas: we can ever write our own
[07/16/2007 06:17:12 PM] Robert Douglas: ever=even
[07/16/2007 06:18:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i think that since you don't want to use the email features, which is like half of cerberus then we should find something else
[07/16/2007 06:19:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you goal is to just display question and answers to users, why not use the forum?
[07/16/2007 06:19:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: plenty of companies offer a public forum, and it would be fairly easy to write a script to extract only certain parts from the forum dynamically
[07/16/2007 06:19:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i want this to be something we can use in the future
[07/16/2007 06:19:57 PM] Robert Douglas: like an RPS KnowledgeBase
[07/16/2007 06:20:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want to rely on a forum
[07/16/2007 06:20:19 PM] Robert Douglas: i want this to be completely separate from everything
[07/16/2007 06:20:29 PM] Robert Douglas: if one thing goes down, the KB should still work
[07/16/2007 06:20:55 PM] Robert Douglas: you dont want to put your eggs in one basket, u drop the basket u lose it all, much better to spread out risk
[07/16/2007 06:21:11 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/demo/)http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/demo/
[07/16/2007 06:21:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that's a sexy knowledgebase
[07/16/2007 06:21:18 PM] Robert Douglas: but it costs $140
[07/16/2007 06:21:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about a wiki
[07/16/2007 06:21:25 PM] Robert Douglas: wikis suck
[07/16/2007 06:21:36 PM] Robert Douglas: their search is the worst thing i have ever seen
[07/16/2007 06:21:44 PM] Robert Douglas: the great thing about cerberus is that it has an AWESOME search feature
[07/16/2007 06:21:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it is incredibly accurate
[07/16/2007 06:22:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it has a bloated help desk that you don't want
[07/16/2007 06:23:31 PM] Robert Douglas: exactly, strip out the helpdesk
[07/16/2007 06:23:48 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/arizona-web-hosting/knowledgebase/)https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/arizona-web-hosting/knowledgebase/
[07/16/2007 06:24:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i stripped out the GUI part of the KB in cerberus to get that output
[07/16/2007 06:24:12 PM] Robert Douglas: notice how it doesn't have the rest of the stuff displayed?
[07/16/2007 06:24:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: shit isn't displaying at all because of permissions problems on the server
[07/16/2007 06:25:14 PM] Robert Douglas: accept the ssl cert
[07/16/2007 06:25:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i mean on the one i tried to set up today
[07/16/2007 06:25:29 PM] Robert Douglas: ssl cert expired, if you choose to not display the page, then it wont display
[07/16/2007 06:25:36 PM] Robert Douglas: what u mean?
[07/16/2007 06:25:47 PM] Robert Douglas: what permission problems?
[07/16/2007 06:26:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: just problems with the config that i haven't worked out yet
[07/16/2007 06:26:51 PM] Robert Douglas: most KBs have a demo ont he site u d/l them from
[07/16/2007 06:27:04 PM] Robert Douglas: so i wouldnt take the trouble to install it until u know 100% it is the one we gunna use
[07/16/2007 06:46:16 PM] Robert Douglas: talk in here, alex is annoying
[07/16/2007 06:50:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah

[07/16/2007 08:39:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we should go with the one you liked
[07/16/2007 08:40:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: the one for $140
[07/16/2007 08:40:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is a minimal cost relatively
[07/16/2007 08:40:54 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/16/2007 08:41:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i think cerberus is better
[07/16/2007 08:54:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but cerberus would be a pain in the ass to remove selected functions
[07/16/2007 08:54:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: from the admin section too?
[07/16/2007 08:54:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be terrible

[07/31/2007 08:37:03 PM] Robert Douglas: it might be under settings
[07/31/2007 08:37:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so now i have to set it up to get it to stfu
[07/31/2007 08:37:38 PM] Robert Douglas: u could do hard reset

[07/31/2007 08:38:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it just resets the treo
[07/31/2007 08:38:30 PM] Robert Douglas: u take off battery cover and then press button using stylus
[07/31/2007 08:38:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: what happens when you hold the power button?
[07/31/2007 08:38:54 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno,but dont do it
[07/31/2007 08:39:36 PM] Robert Douglas: u restart the treo bny pressing the little reset button using the stylus
[07/31/2007 08:40:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have little black and red arrows?
[07/31/2007 08:40:30 PM] Robert Douglas: no

[07/31/2007 08:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: mine is the 700wx
[07/31/2007 08:41:44 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, i meant soft reset, not hard reset
[07/31/2007 08:41:47 PM] Robert Douglas: soft only restarts it
[07/31/2007 08:41:55 PM] Robert Douglas: hard iswhere u use the power button to erase all data
[07/31/2007 08:46:04 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have any idea about the SQL command? (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4699)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4699
[07/31/2007 08:49:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i am pissed off
[07/31/2007 08:49:44 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/31/2007 08:50:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: every god damn time i set it down infront of my computer it comes up with a driver install dialog and lags my laptop to all hell because verizon couldn't fucking supply all the drivers together
[07/31/2007 08:50:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so now i have to go fucking search around for more drivers for the irda port
[07/31/2007 08:50:45 PM] Robert Douglas: u prolly have to uninstall completely and then reinstall each one
[07/31/2007 08:50:53 PM] Robert Douglas: better clean install than reinstall
[07/31/2007 08:51:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is missing entirely
[07/31/2007 08:51:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know what the fuck is going on
[07/31/2007 08:52:21 PM] Robert Douglas: gtg pick up food
[07/31/2007 08:52:26 PM] Robert Douglas: check the palmwebsite
[07/31/2007 08:52:31 PM] Robert Douglas: they should have everything on their
[07/31/2007 08:55:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like i had the drivers already
[07/31/2007 08:55:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: just needed to be installed
[07/31/2007 08:55:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can get the sand out of my vagina now
[07/31/2007 08:56:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: something is still fucking up with my headset
[07/31/2007 09:25:49 PM] Robert Douglas: any luick wioth the sql command?
[07/31/2007 09:26:08 PM] Robert Douglas: my moto headset blows on the treo
[07/31/2007 09:32:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i don't have the mental capacity to work on that tonight
[07/31/2007 09:32:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think we should just write a php script to do it
[07/31/2007 09:32:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and use regexp
[07/31/2007 09:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not hard, its the same thing as the mod_rewrite stuff
[07/31/2007 09:33:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never done it before
[07/31/2007 09:33:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i was hoping u could write it and i could learn from what you write
[07/31/2007 09:33:30 PM] Robert Douglas: but i wanted it in an SQL statement
[07/31/2007 09:33:31 PM] Robert Douglas: not php
[07/31/2007 09:33:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can write the regexp command
[07/31/2007 09:35:14 PM] Robert Douglas: we can just use \d

[08/01/2007 10:21:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: about what?
[08/01/2007 10:21:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: mention that their dev documentation is horrible
[08/01/2007 10:24:54 AM] Robert Douglas: good point
[08/01/2007 10:25:00 AM] Robert Douglas: the inters get to meet executives
[08/01/2007 10:25:02 AM] Robert Douglas: and ask questions
[08/01/2007 10:28:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: awesome
[08/01/2007 10:28:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: ask them why their dev support sucks ass
[08/01/2007 10:32:07 AM] Robert Douglas: have u tried contacting paypal dev support?
[08/01/2007 10:32:11 AM] Robert Douglas: i didnt even know they had it
[08/01/2007 10:33:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: i meant the entire dev documentation sucks ass
[08/01/2007 10:35:58 AM] Robert Douglas: does paypal have specific developer support?
[08/01/2007 10:36:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: just their forum
[08/01/2007 10:36:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: but every problem i have run into is something that should have been stated in the documentation
[08/01/2007 10:37:20 AM] Robert Douglas: if u can explain a specific example, i'll ask that exact question today
[08/01/2007 10:37:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: like creating a business account you enter a fake social security number, i had to look that up in the forum when it should have been in their documentation under the getting setup section
[08/01/2007 10:37:28 AM] Robert Douglas: when i say "improve api"
[08/01/2007 10:37:34 AM] Robert Douglas: he gunna be like, "improve what?"
[08/01/2007 10:37:54 AM] Robert Douglas: good points
[08/01/2007 10:38:11 AM] Robert Douglas: the more info i give him, the better my question will sound :)
[08/01/2007 10:40:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i had to look up confirming a transaction in the forum
[08/01/2007 10:40:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: only to find there was a poorly placed button to click to confirm the transaction immediately while testing
[08/01/2007 10:41:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats something that should have been in the documentation for using the test paypal accounts

[08/01/2007 01:05:58 PM] Robert Douglas: so PP isnt doing much with the dev area lol
[08/01/2007 01:06:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: really? i couldn't tell
[08/01/2007 01:06:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i asked the CTO
[08/01/2007 01:06:20 PM] Robert Douglas: and he paused for a sec
[08/01/2007 01:06:23 PM] Robert Douglas: and was like 
[08/01/2007 01:06:25 PM] Robert Douglas: "well uhh"
[08/01/2007 01:06:28 PM] Robert Douglas: and i interrupted and said
[08/01/2007 01:06:34 PM] Robert Douglas: "so basically no plan to do anything with it"
[08/01/2007 01:06:37 PM] Robert Douglas: and everyone laughed lmao
[08/01/2007 01:06:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: good call
[08/01/2007 01:07:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice to know they are really making progress
[08/01/2007 01:07:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would call it a fairly large department
[08/01/2007 01:08:18 PM] Robert Douglas: they have much larger goals
[08/01/2007 01:08:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would say it holds a lot of clientele, as far as using the api for business accounts and merchant services, so that surprises me that they don't plan to improve it
[08/01/2007 01:08:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i doubt many people know the actual goal for paypal
[08/01/2007 01:08:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: so why are there no keys for the sbp software?
[08/01/2007 01:08:45 PM] Robert Douglas: their #1 goal is something hidden to most people
[08/01/2007 01:08:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is their #1 goal?
[08/01/2007 01:09:11 PM] Robert Douglas: care to try and guess before i mention it?
[08/01/2007 01:09:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me think
[08/01/2007 01:09:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: competing with ebay?
[08/01/2007 01:09:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt have a clue 
[08/01/2007 01:09:53 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, not even close
[08/01/2007 01:09:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i pulled that out of my ass
[08/01/2007 01:10:01 PM] Robert Douglas: paypal is owned by ebay
[08/01/2007 01:10:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, now that i didn't know
[08/01/2007 01:10:23 PM] Robert Douglas: who are the top people in terms of credit cards?
[08/01/2007 01:10:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: competing with credit card companies
[08/01/2007 01:10:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was my next guess
[08/01/2007 01:10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: that's much closer
[08/01/2007 01:10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: but if you think of CCs
[08/01/2007 01:10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: you think of Visa (which is Visa net), Mastercard, Amex
[08/01/2007 01:10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: etc...
[08/01/2007 01:10:59 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[08/01/2007 01:11:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/01/2007 01:11:11 PM] Robert Douglas: what does PP offer that those companies do not?
[08/01/2007 01:11:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: more robust online transactions and integration into almost every merchant out there?
[08/01/2007 01:11:54 PM] Robert Douglas: once i tell you, ur gunna bne like damn that's a good idea
[08/01/2007 01:12:00 PM] Robert Douglas: not even close
[08/01/2007 01:12:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm
[08/01/2007 01:12:07 PM] Robert Douglas: so here goes...
[08/01/2007 01:12:34 PM] Robert Douglas: when you pay for something online, you give the mercant authorization to take money out
[08/01/2007 01:12:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need keys for sbp mobile software
[08/01/2007 01:12:57 PM] Robert Douglas: when you use a CC, the mercant has the ability to take out as much as they want
[08/01/2007 01:13:12 PM] Robert Douglas: when you use your PP account, PP determines the amoutn that is supposed to be sent over to the mercahnt
[08/01/2007 01:14:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so you have the greater security, of the only person being able to take your information, is PP itself
[08/01/2007 01:14:48 PM] Robert Douglas: think about what happens
[08/01/2007 01:14:50 PM] Robert Douglas: you enter your CC
[08/01/2007 01:14:59 PM] Robert Douglas: merchant is able to determine how much money they take out
[08/01/2007 01:15:02 PM] Robert Douglas: as well as store your CC info
[08/01/2007 01:15:06 PM] Robert Douglas: with paypal
[08/01/2007 01:15:15 PM] Robert Douglas: the merchant has ZERO control over that
[08/01/2007 01:15:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess that makes sense
[08/01/2007 01:36:56 PM] Robert Douglas: PayPal wants to be the most commonly used payment option for the internet

[08/05/2007 06:21:13 PM] Robert Douglas: it was a pain in the ass
[08/05/2007 06:21:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/05/2007 06:21:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm trying to figure out why the submit buttons arent working
[08/05/2007 06:21:34 PM] Robert Douglas: the add 2 cart works
[08/05/2007 06:21:37 PM] Robert Douglas: but the others do not
[08/05/2007 06:21:56 PM] Robert Douglas: add 2 cart, and rating button works
[08/05/2007 06:22:19 PM] Robert Douglas: but you cant send 2 friend, and u cant submit a review (although u can rate it)
[08/05/2007 06:22:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: after you implemented it?
[08/05/2007 06:22:27 PM] Robert Douglas: correct
[08/05/2007 06:22:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: after you implemented your part?
[08/05/2007 06:22:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, but i never verified it worked before
[08/05/2007 06:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might be able to fix it i was having a similar problem before when i did the other part
[08/05/2007 06:23:13 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i havent reallylooked into why it wasnt working
[08/05/2007 06:23:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[08/05/2007 06:23:25 PM] Robert Douglas: itwas a bitch 2 do
[08/05/2007 06:23:28 PM] Robert Douglas: and by the time i was done
[08/05/2007 06:23:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses complex javascripts to submit forms
[08/05/2007 06:23:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i wasnt int he mood to try to figure that submit issue out lol
[08/05/2007 06:27:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know how that is
[08/05/2007 06:27:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could never figure out the spacing between the menus on the left and right, and the content in the middle
[08/05/2007 06:27:58 PM] Robert Douglas: i'lll look at that once i get the buttons to work
[08/05/2007 06:38:42 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea what the fix was for the submit forms?
[08/05/2007 06:38:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt change the form names at all
[08/05/2007 06:40:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to trace through all the steps it takes in generating a button
[08/05/2007 06:40:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses a whole chain of includes
[08/05/2007 06:41:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a pain in the ass, there isn't really any way to describe it because its slightly different for each button
[08/05/2007 06:41:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i might have erased the closing form tag
[08/05/2007 06:41:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would do it
[08/05/2007 06:41:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: compare your new code with the original structure
[08/05/2007 06:41:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and make sure that <forms> and <img> and <a> elements line up
[08/05/2007 06:42:51 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, it was jsut a closing form tag lol
[08/05/2007 06:43:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh oh
[08/05/2007 06:43:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: does it work now?
[08/05/2007 06:43:16 PM] Robert Douglas: the send one does
[08/05/2007 06:43:19 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure if other does 
[08/05/2007 07:53:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude i'm gonna have to finish this paypal stuff tomorrow
[08/05/2007 07:53:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i know exactly what i have to do now
[08/05/2007 07:53:37 PM] Robert Douglas: it would be cool if we could get it done right now, but i understand
[08/05/2007 07:53:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: create a column in the database and then slightly modify the way it looks it up
[08/05/2007 07:54:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: it won't take me long, i will do it before you even get up tomorrow
[08/05/2007 07:55:00 PM] Robert Douglas: alright cool man

[08/06/2007 10:30:09 AM] Robert Douglas: u run the zip ties through the mount
[08/06/2007 10:30:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: zip ties suck
[08/06/2007 10:30:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: then you have to cut them when you want to move something
[08/06/2007 10:33:04 AM] Robert Douglas: i dunno, i think having a cable sleeve + zip ties/mounts is much better
[08/06/2007 10:33:21 AM] Robert Douglas: the thing u have is too bulky
[08/06/2007 10:33:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: not it you mount it to the wall
[08/06/2007 10:33:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: like behind a desk
[08/06/2007 10:33:56 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i dont like that at all
[08/06/2007 10:34:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: your mom

[08/06/2007 10:54:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is intentional?
[08/06/2007 10:54:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: it looks like a hack
[08/06/2007 10:54:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: "taking over the world"
[08/06/2007 10:54:58 AM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/06/2007 10:55:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: why is it PWD protected now?
[08/06/2007 10:55:33 AM] Robert Douglas: long story lol
[08/06/2007 10:55:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: because its under dev?
[08/06/2007 10:57:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok looks like its working besides the fact that yahoo fucking sucks and is timing out my script

[08/06/2007 10:58:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: rps testing account that is
[08/06/2007 10:58:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: return to Details.php, iterator also runs details.php, that will check for all uncleared invoice numbers and see if there is a transaction made with that invoice numbers
[08/06/2007 10:59:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: *with that invoice number
[08/06/2007 11:00:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: if the user closes and doesn't return, then the iterator will catch it on its next pass, if they close out of paying all together and never pay, they will be in the database with a status of new/unpaid
[08/06/2007 11:00:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: call me at your convenience, i have to go run errands
[08/06/2007 11:01:22 AM] Robert Douglas: what jhappens to everyone that is already on the list
[08/06/2007 11:01:32 AM] Robert Douglas: and what about the people that pay by check, they wont have an invoice
[08/06/2007 11:02:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: the invoice number is associated with the transaction, if i specify one, they will get it
[08/06/2007 11:02:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: everyone on the list already won't be affected at all
[08/06/2007 11:02:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: and can still use the new system

[08/06/2007 01:44:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and don't need one
[08/06/2007 01:45:08 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/06/2007 01:45:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: what you think i am joking/
[08/06/2007 01:45:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/06/2007 01:45:26 PM] Robert Douglas: no, that's why i laughed
[08/06/2007 01:45:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am so good at using teh internet that i don't fuck up my computer
[08/06/2007 01:45:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i thought it was funny that u think u dont need an AV
[08/06/2007 01:45:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i only use the best software
[08/06/2007 01:45:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't need one
[08/06/2007 01:46:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i garuntee if i install an AV and anti spyware, it will come up clean
[08/06/2007 01:46:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't get viruses, and i would know if i did
[08/06/2007 01:46:39 PM] Robert Douglas: but when u go to a website that is infected, you become infected
[08/06/2007 01:46:54 PM] Robert Douglas: lots of viruses you cant tell u are infected until it is too late
[08/06/2007 01:49:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: not true, a lot of times viruses start out in the cache
[08/06/2007 01:49:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: or as plugins
[08/06/2007 01:49:30 PM] Robert Douglas: you are saying that it is not true that "lots of viruses you cant tell u are infected until it is too late"
[08/06/2007 01:49:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and since i delete my cache frequently, and never install plugins, i don't get infected
[08/06/2007 01:50:23 PM] Robert Douglas: you can get infected just by visiting a web page
[08/06/2007 01:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: neg
[08/06/2007 01:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: that doesn't make any sense
[08/06/2007 01:52:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can get malicious cached files, but unless those are executed by something else, there is no way
[08/06/2007 01:52:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i haven't used an AV in over a year, if you want to test my theory i will install kapersky just for you and send you the log
[08/06/2007 01:52:40 PM] Robert Douglas: well, my AV picks it up when i visit infected pages
[08/06/2007 01:52:50 PM] Robert Douglas: clearing your cache doesn't mean you will be safe
[08/06/2007 01:53:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want to test my theory?
[08/06/2007 01:53:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: got a license i can borrow?
[08/06/2007 01:53:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i have a KIS license, but instead, how about i send u to a URL that has a virus
[08/06/2007 01:53:27 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be the for sure test
[08/06/2007 01:53:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/06/2007 01:53:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[08/06/2007 01:53:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of virus?
[08/06/2007 01:54:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant search for the stuff on the ebay machine, but when i get back i'll make sure to get a list of links for u to visit 
[08/06/2007 01:55:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: can i have KIS license?
[08/06/2007 01:55:46 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, but i would like to test your theory first by sending u to a virus page
[08/06/2007 01:55:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/06/2007 01:56:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but why would i visit that virus page in the first place?
[08/06/2007 01:56:34 PM] Robert Douglas: to prove that you are safe
[08/06/2007 01:56:44 PM] Robert Douglas: to prove that you dont need an AV

[08/06/2007 06:16:51 PM] Robert Douglas: did u put it up on the azrn site?
[08/06/2007 06:17:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but make sure you like that, and by the time you come up with a list of complaints, i should be back up and running
[08/06/2007 06:17:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: its on the dev site

[08/06/2007 10:05:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: while my desktop is reinstalling windows
[08/06/2007 10:07:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: reinstalling is so easy when every large software suite is stored on a local system
[08/06/2007 10:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[08/06/2007 10:23:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: backed up wrong dreamweaver settings
[08/06/2007 10:23:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: we might have to set up new passwords if they are not in pmxp

[08/07/2007 12:18:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to modify the format for protocols, it is not being followed
[08/07/2007 12:19:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: lets do something even cooler, lets make the div class=protocol a bbcode tag
[08/07/2007 12:19:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be sweet
[08/07/2007 12:20:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we add a button for Protocol and it shows up as [Protocol][/Protocol]

[08/07/2007 02:14:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i like that
[08/07/2007 02:14:59 PM] Robert Douglas: but the current way isnt too complex for now
[08/07/2007 02:15:06 PM] Robert Douglas: you just have to copy the html
[08/07/2007 02:15:12 PM] Robert Douglas: and then paste it and add ur info in
[08/07/2007 02:15:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't address using numbers and typing ul and li is a pain in the ass
[08/07/2007 02:15:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: and alex doesn't even use it
[08/07/2007 02:15:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he bitches to me about it
[08/07/2007 02:15:45 PM] Robert Douglas: alex is supposed to be using it
[08/07/2007 02:15:50 PM] Robert Douglas: show me a post and i'll bitch at him
[08/07/2007 02:15:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: he uses the format, just not the bullets
[08/07/2007 02:16:04 PM] Robert Douglas: all new protocols should be written using that
[08/07/2007 02:16:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i made him redo his protocols when he started doing the wrong format
[08/07/2007 02:16:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should be able to simulate bullets with just plain text, all that extra code and typing for one little dot is a pain in the ass
[08/07/2007 02:16:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i liked using dashes instead of bullets
[08/07/2007 02:16:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: just typing -some information is good, and it looks good
[08/07/2007 02:16:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[08/07/2007 02:17:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the leads protocol is what i am referring to, he uses dashes

[08/07/2007 02:17:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it looks fine
[08/07/2007 02:17:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we just need to simplify it a bit, and we can worry about adding on bbcode later
[08/07/2007 02:17:46 PM] Robert Douglas: that post is from last yr
[08/07/2007 02:17:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: because we will have bbcode for a lot more stuff
[08/07/2007 02:18:01 PM] Robert Douglas: we can use dashes
[08/07/2007 02:18:03 PM] Robert Douglas: that's fine

[08/07/2007 02:40:19 PM] Robert Douglas: have u completely tested the new version?
[08/07/2007 02:40:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/07/2007 02:41:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that still doesn't change the fact that we need a cron for sending out e-mails and checking for transactions if they close the window and don't return to the merchant
[08/07/2007 02:41:41 PM] Robert Douglas: right
[08/07/2007 02:41:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we can setup a cron on the RPS account
[08/07/2007 02:41:57 PM] Robert Douglas: that will be able to run the file remotely
[08/07/2007 02:42:18 PM] Robert Douglas: so the client doesnt need to worry about their gay yahoo account not being able to use crons
[08/07/2007 02:45:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have login credentials wirth me at ebay

[08/07/2007 03:18:02 PM] Robert Douglas: this still works?
[08/07/2007 03:18:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should, but it doesnt redirect to the /testing/Renew.php it just goes to Renew.php like it should
[08/07/2007 03:18:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: the /testing/Renew.php uses the new system
[08/07/2007 03:19:54 PM] Robert Douglas: can u update (Link: http://dev.rp-s.com/Membership-Signup.php)http://dev.rp-s.com/Membership-Signup.php so I can do a complete test?

[08/07/2007 03:24:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you already know it works, i didn't even change that page, so stop fucking testing that and follow my instructions
[08/07/2007 03:24:37 PM] Robert Douglas: in order to test it, we have to do a full example
[08/07/2007 03:24:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i could care less if it works without doing a new signup
[08/07/2007 03:24:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: well then go ahead and change the redirect path
[08/07/2007 03:24:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i care more abotu it working after i do a new signup
[08/07/2007 03:25:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it is in your hands now
[08/07/2007 03:25:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you will also have to put the Firstname and Lastname in the redirect path
[08/07/2007 03:25:48 PM] Robert Douglas: <form action="" method="post" onSubmit="return checkFields(this);">
[08/07/2007 03:25:56 PM] Robert Douglas: so i should change that to testing/Renew.php?
[08/07/2007 03:26:03 PM] Robert Douglas: the action p[art
[08/07/2007 03:26:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[08/07/2007 03:26:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses header() after the information is saved

[08/07/2007 03:27:08 PM] Robert Douglas: header('Location: testing/Renew.php');
[08/07/2007 03:27:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the only change?

[08/07/2007 03:28:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: or whatever is saved in the DB for firstname and lastname
[08/07/2007 03:29:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: should also be set in the header path
[08/07/2007 03:29:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/07/2007 03:29:22 PM] Robert Douglas: header('Location: /dbadmin/testing/Renew.php?Firstname=$_POST['Firstname']&Lastname=$_POST['Lastname']');
[08/07/2007 03:29:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: is the $_Post what is used above?
[08/07/2007 03:29:48 PM] Robert Douglas: $_SESSION['post']['Lastname']
[08/07/2007 03:29:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: then use that instead
[08/07/2007 03:29:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i c that above in the insert to db command
[08/07/2007 03:30:16 PM] Robert Douglas: header('Location: /dbadmin/testing/Renew.php?Firstname=$_SESSION['post']['Firstname']&Lastname=$_SESSION['post']['Lastname']');
[08/07/2007 03:31:21 PM] Robert Douglas: anything else 2 change?

[08/07/2007 10:43:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/07/2007 10:43:17 PM] Robert Douglas: can u go set it up ont he azrn live site?
[08/07/2007 10:43:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: only limitation i see so far is the cron
[08/07/2007 10:43:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes but i will need login information again
[08/07/2007 10:43:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: this time put it in pmxp
[08/07/2007 10:43:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: not in there
[08/07/2007 10:43:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: bish
[08/07/2007 10:43:48 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[08/07/2007 10:43:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i put it in
[08/07/2007 10:44:08 PM] Robert Douglas: dk1227
[08/07/2007 10:44:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: must have been overwritten because pmxp doesn't support multi user
[08/07/2007 10:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could write a better fucking password manager with my eyes closed
[08/07/2007 10:44:45 PM] Robert Douglas: azradiologyrn
[08/07/2007 10:44:47 PM] Robert Douglas: dk1227
[08/07/2007 10:44:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[08/07/2007 10:45:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would make a server deamon in java for handling passwords
[08/07/2007 10:45:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be so hot
[08/07/2007 10:45:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: each password would have its own file, and the directory structure of the database would be based on the filesystem directory structure
[08/07/2007 10:45:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i'd use AES encryption
[08/07/2007 10:45:53 PM] Robert Douglas: lets talk after lol
[08/07/2007 10:45:56 PM] Robert Douglas: god dammit
[08/07/2007 10:46:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: for decrypting off filesystem
[08/07/2007 10:46:01 PM] Robert Douglas: ur acting like alex in our meeting
[08/07/2007 10:46:02 PM] Robert Douglas: s
[08/07/2007 10:46:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then i would make the server only one one password at a time, so multiple users can log in and changes as many passwords as they want
[08/07/2007 10:47:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: none of this 20 database shit that netdrive caches like a bitch so it always overwrites stuff
[08/07/2007 10:47:12 PM] Robert Douglas: host: ftp.azradiologyrn.net 
user: azradiologyrn@azradiologyrn.net 
pass: dk1227
[08/07/2007 10:47:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if passwords are changes withing like 30 seconds from 2 different sources, i would alert both clients of the change
[08/07/2007 10:47:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there would be user management, so people could log in under certain names to the password server just like dreamweavers checking in/out service
[08/07/2007 10:48:00 PM] Robert Douglas: dude
[08/07/2007 10:48:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd like to email azrn
[08/07/2007 10:48:08 PM] Robert Douglas: and tell her all is well
[08/07/2007 10:48:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: then can i write a new password program?
[08/07/2007 10:48:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could even do it in vb and it would suck less
[08/07/2007 10:48:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i could do this shit in assembly
[08/07/2007 10:48:53 PM] Robert Douglas: we can talk once azrn is fully tested
[08/07/2007 10:49:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could write multiple clients one in VB and one in java for our linux users in the time that we spend recovering deleted passwords
[08/07/2007 10:49:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/07/2007 10:50:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i need 2 go get my laundry started
[08/07/2007 10:50:32 PM] Robert Douglas: look at the current azrn files because the directory strucutre is really fucked up
[08/07/2007 10:52:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is it fucked up?
[08/07/2007 10:52:27 PM] Robert Douglas: they store it weird
[08/07/2007 10:53:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i can't get printing to work
[08/07/2007 10:53:41 PM] Robert Douglas: dude azrn is really high priority

[08/07/2007 10:55:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will reinstall dreamweaver
[08/07/2007 10:55:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and getting this fucking printer working is high priority
[08/07/2007 10:56:33 PM] Robert Douglas: why cant u reinstall?
[08/07/2007 11:00:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i need my desktop to install drivers on my laptop
[08/07/2007 11:00:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to be out a computer
[08/07/2007 11:06:06 PM] Robert Douglas: no i mean why cant u install it on your desktop?
[08/07/2007 11:06:25 PM] Robert Douglas: can you tell me what files have changed?

[08/07/2007 11:09:29 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, but i should only have to replace them on the azrn site
[08/07/2007 11:09:48 PM] Robert Douglas: what about the added table

[08/07/2007 11:11:15 PM] Robert Douglas: the css style?
[08/07/2007 11:11:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the live site
[08/07/2007 11:11:46 PM] Robert Douglas: that was a question about what u meant by style
[08/07/2007 11:11:51 PM] Robert Douglas: the css style?
[08/07/2007 11:13:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah or just extra includes for those pages since the dev site doesn't look like the live site

[08/08/2007 12:50:16 AM] Robert Douglas: when the member pays
[08/08/2007 12:50:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: it couldn't purify it because it was using to much wattage

[08/08/2007 12:52:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: takes hours
[08/08/2007 12:52:11 AM] Robert Douglas: DW takes 5 mins to install
[08/08/2007 12:52:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it is corrupted because of a previous version not being uninstalled
[08/08/2007 12:52:35 AM] Robert Douglas: DW is usually pretty good at that stuff
[08/08/2007 12:52:39 AM] Robert Douglas: why not install textpad
[08/08/2007 12:52:41 AM] Robert Douglas: or something else

[08/08/2007 01:07:50 AM] Robert Douglas: i think u changed another file
[08/08/2007 01:07:57 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe it runs the iterator?

[08/08/2007 01:08:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes i did change iterator
[08/08/2007 01:08:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that shouldn't affect it
[08/08/2007 01:08:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: are you uploading iterator or should i?
[08/08/2007 01:09:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't see enough

[08/08/2007 01:24:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure why it would work on the dev site and not on live site
[08/08/2007 01:25:02 AM] Robert Douglas: because not all files have changed probablly
[08/08/2007 01:25:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need to turn on error printing, we must be missing something

[08/08/2007 11:21:57 AM] Robert Douglas: hav eu been able 2 do anything with AZRN yet?
[08/08/2007 11:42:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude i can figure out what is wrong with it
[08/08/2007 11:42:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was up til 4 am last night
[08/08/2007 11:42:52 AM] Robert Douglas: ?
[08/08/2007 11:43:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is so hard to track what is going on without being able to see the database at every step
[08/08/2007 11:43:39 AM] Robert Douglas: Brian Cullinan says (11:42 AM): 
dude i can figure out what is wrong with it
[08/08/2007 11:43:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: AZRN
[08/08/2007 11:43:53 AM] Robert Douglas: if you "can" figure it out
[08/08/2007 11:43:58 AM] Robert Douglas: why isnt it done
[08/08/2007 11:44:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: *can't
[08/08/2007 11:44:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: sry typo
[08/08/2007 11:44:02 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/08/2007 11:44:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: my bad
[08/08/2007 11:44:06 AM] Robert Douglas: that changes the entire sent
[08/08/2007 11:44:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah just a little
[08/08/2007 11:44:29 AM] Robert Douglas: well the DB works
[08/08/2007 11:44:40 AM] Robert Douglas: the issue is some code
[08/08/2007 11:44:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: works? you mean it displays
[08/08/2007 11:44:58 AM] Robert Douglas: i viewed the DB
[08/08/2007 11:45:00 AM] Robert Douglas: it looks fine
[08/08/2007 11:45:11 AM] Robert Douglas: the issue is that a page hasnt been updated
[08/08/2007 11:45:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need to be able to try many transactions without having to pay them
[08/08/2007 11:45:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i thought we updated all the pages i changed?
[08/08/2007 11:45:48 AM] Robert Douglas: i updated all of the pages we discussed yesterday
[08/08/2007 11:45:55 AM] Robert Douglas: but it sounds like there are other pages that need to be updated
[08/08/2007 11:46:00 AM] Robert Douglas: brb
[08/08/2007 11:46:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: some of the pages on the dev site are older versions
[08/08/2007 11:46:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: the add-member in dbadmin on dev site is wrong, do not replace that one
[08/08/2007 11:47:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: this entire project is foobared
[08/08/2007 11:47:53 AM] Robert Douglas: this isnt cool lol
[08/08/2007 11:47:58 AM] Robert Douglas: gunna take a lot of work to move it over
[08/08/2007 11:48:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't believe that the date was the 31st before making the transaction
[08/08/2007 11:48:16 AM] Robert Douglas: according to the databse, it was
[08/08/2007 11:48:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we need to try a new one
[08/08/2007 11:48:23 AM] Robert Douglas: even on the dev site it shows the 31st
[08/08/2007 11:48:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i want to see it every thing you do
[08/08/2007 11:48:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: on the dev site everything works fine
[08/08/2007 11:48:44 AM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/08/2007 11:48:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you copied every page i told you i changed
[08/08/2007 11:48:56 AM] Robert Douglas: but both versions (after implementing your updates) have the date changed to the 1st
[08/08/2007 11:49:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[08/08/2007 11:49:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just tried the dev site after you said that and it does not change to the 1st
[08/08/2007 11:49:27 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://dev.rp-s.com/dbadmin/View-Modify-Members.php)http://dev.rp-s.com/dbadmin/View-Modify-Members.php
[08/08/2007 11:49:38 AM] Robert Douglas: check it out
[08/08/2007 11:49:47 AM] Robert Douglas: the last ones we added are the 1st
[08/08/2007 11:49:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know what is happening now
[08/08/2007 11:49:53 AM] Robert Douglas: the ones before that, were set to 31st
[08/08/2007 11:49:59 AM] Robert Douglas: same with azrn now
[08/08/2007 11:50:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: remember that 1 entry that was the 1st, or possibly the add-member page defaults to the first per your request
[08/08/2007 11:50:55 AM] Robert Douglas: no, i dont remember an entry being the 1st until u made this last set of chnages
[08/08/2007 11:50:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: it only selects your first and last name, and then incrememnts the first instance of the expiration date
[08/08/2007 11:51:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i saw that there were the 1st entries the other day
[08/08/2007 11:51:19 AM] Robert Douglas: none of my emails ask u to change it the first
[08/08/2007 11:51:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: but when i make a payment under my name everything works
[08/08/2007 11:51:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: those were already the set to 1st
[08/08/2007 11:51:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: before i even started the new system
[08/08/2007 11:52:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i checked the database and saw those inconsistencies
[08/08/2007 11:52:28 AM] Robert Douglas: pretty sure those 2 in the dev site, were added the other day
[08/08/2007 11:52:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: so make a payment but enter my name using (Link: http://dev.rp-s.com/dbadmin/testing/Renew.php)http://dev.rp-s.com/dbadmin/testing/Renew.php
[08/08/2007 11:52:48 AM] Robert Douglas: i gotta run 2 a meeting
[08/08/2007 11:52:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: your name was already in the database with a date of 1st
[08/08/2007 11:52:58 AM] Robert Douglas: so if u can test this stuff, it would be great
[08/08/2007 11:53:11 AM] Robert Douglas: i just gotta get everything completely running
[08/08/2007 11:53:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is all i remember, and since it only loads your name it will increment the first occurnce so even if you had new entries for the 31st, it would replace them with an incremented 1st date
[08/08/2007 11:54:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is what the error is, too much fucking test entries
[08/08/2007 11:56:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: the 1st is being set when you sign up
[08/08/2007 11:56:49 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/08/2007 11:56:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i remmeber you telling me to make that change
[08/08/2007 11:57:00 AM] Robert Douglas: so you will fixx it?
[08/08/2007 11:57:07 AM] Robert Douglas: i dont see that int he email anywhere
[08/08/2007 11:57:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you were wrong about it being different before you payed
[08/08/2007 11:57:46 AM] Robert Douglas: the "before" part was before you made the changes
[08/08/2007 11:57:49 AM] Robert Douglas: not before you paid
[08/08/2007 11:58:02 AM] Robert Douglas: it was doing the 31st until u made the last set of changes
[08/08/2007 11:58:08 AM] Robert Douglas: dunno what the issue is
[08/08/2007 11:58:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: emember when that 1 green one was showing up?
[08/08/2007 11:58:19 AM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/08/2007 11:58:38 AM] Robert Douglas: we're wasting time discussing this, can you fix it or not?
[08/08/2007 11:58:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i had to log in to see the date was the first and i asked you through IM if that was right
[08/08/2007 11:59:20 AM] Robert Douglas: can u verify through history that you were asked to change it to the 1st?
[08/08/2007 11:59:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: looking
[08/08/2007 11:59:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it was accidentally always like that
[08/08/2007 12:00:03 PM] Robert Douglas: it was 31st int he past
[08/08/2007 12:00:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta jet
[08/08/2007 12:00:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: since we always inputted memebers ourselves through the admin interface
[08/08/2007 12:00:12 PM] Robert Douglas: be back in 1 hr
[08/08/2007 12:02:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: correction has been made to live site
[08/08/2007 12:03:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not going to pay them, you will have to test it again, and have them refund all your testing
[08/08/2007 12:04:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the live site that is
[08/08/2007 12:04:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll test it all day on the dev site
[08/08/2007 12:05:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: once again it works
[08/08/2007 12:05:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: for me
[08/08/2007 12:05:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: so lets find out if you can screw it up again

[08/08/2007 01:37:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: fixed print.php
[08/08/2007 01:38:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: like it doesn't count all the selected members when you click e-mail, now there is a toggle that adds or subtracts from the count
[08/08/2007 01:38:19 PM] Robert Douglas: yay
[08/08/2007 01:38:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you click e-mail selected then are like "shit i forgot 1 person", it will show up in the total members selected

[08/08/2007 01:44:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: shit maybe i overwrote something
[08/08/2007 01:45:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember when we had that error and it was just because of yahoo blocking who it was from
[08/08/2007 01:45:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/08/2007 01:45:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you remember how we solved that problem?
[08/08/2007 01:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahh i found it
[08/08/2007 01:46:28 PM] Robert Douglas: from email addy
[08/08/2007 01:47:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i overwrote it
[08/08/2007 01:47:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: my bad
[08/08/2007 01:48:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: should be fine now
[08/08/2007 01:49:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: for some gay reason the e-mail selected still takes a long time to display
[08/08/2007 01:50:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you know if they sent that e-mail that didn't show up right from the modify members page or the iterator sent it?
[08/08/2007 01:53:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am submitting an error to VMware KB
[08/08/2007 02:01:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it was the modify members page that sent it
[08/08/2007 02:01:43 PM] Robert Douglas: u can look at the source and see tho
[08/08/2007 02:02:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok well if the modify members page sent it, the first and last name replacement was not coded and that has been fixed
[08/08/2007 02:02:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just tested it
[08/08/2007 02:02:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think we are done
[08/08/2007 02:02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: so can u go froms tart to finish
[08/08/2007 02:02:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: no you do it
[08/08/2007 02:03:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: you pay them and then get refund
[08/08/2007 02:03:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're the one that always breaks it, whenever i test it it works for me
[08/08/2007 02:03:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i went from start to finish on dev server and made the date fix on the live server
[08/08/2007 02:04:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if it doesnt work for me, it wont work for you
[08/08/2007 02:04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: you need to test azrn, not dev
[08/08/2007 02:04:34 PM] Robert Douglas: both of us already said it works on dev
[08/08/2007 02:05:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tested dev last night again and got the same error of the date being 01, same as you got on live site and completely missed, then i corrected that error
[08/08/2007 02:05:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so its your turn to test it again
[08/08/2007 02:05:45 PM] Robert Douglas: oh, u just want me to test the error
[08/08/2007 02:05:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is bullshit that if it fails for you it will fail for me
[08/08/2007 02:06:03 PM] Robert Douglas: no it isnt, it works the same way no matter the computer u are one
[08/08/2007 02:06:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt work for u on azrn
[08/08/2007 02:06:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want you to go all the way through it, instead of me, because it works for me, you always seem to find a way to break it
[08/08/2007 02:06:34 PM] Robert Douglas: it works completely for u on azrn?
[08/08/2007 02:06:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the dev site yes
[08/08/2007 02:06:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: [08/08/2007 02:04:34 PM] Robert Douglas: both of us already said it works on dev
 
[08/08/2007 02:07:00 PM] Robert Douglas: it works for me on the dev site too
[08/08/2007 02:07:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is not true
[08/08/2007 02:07:21 PM] Robert Douglas: the issue we have is for the azrn site, not the dev site...
[08/08/2007 02:07:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tested it again on dev site and found the same error that you skipped over on live site
[08/08/2007 02:07:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the dev site did not work entirely, just like live site, and i corrected the error last night
[08/08/2007 02:07:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the issue
[08/08/2007 02:07:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: the one i fixed
[08/08/2007 02:08:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: showed up on both sites
[08/08/2007 02:08:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i corrected it on live site
[08/08/2007 02:08:27 PM] Robert Douglas: so you're talking about the date issue, not the issue with not being able to go from start to finish on the azrn site, right?
[08/08/2007 02:08:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes the date issue was the only problem
[08/08/2007 02:09:14 PM] Robert Douglas: the bigger problem was the fact the member was still set to unpaid
[08/08/2007 02:09:19 PM] Robert Douglas: after they completed the entire process
[08/08/2007 02:09:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: everything is good but the 1st should be 31st
[08/08/2007 02:09:21 PM] Robert Douglas: on the azrn site
[08/08/2007 02:09:24 PM] Robert Douglas: remember?
[08/08/2007 02:09:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what you said last night
[08/08/2007 02:09:27 PM] Robert Douglas: that was the main issue
[08/08/2007 02:09:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: "everything is good but the 1st should be 31st"
[08/08/2007 02:09:31 PM] Robert Douglas: the HUGE issue
[08/08/2007 02:09:41 PM] Robert Douglas: that's for the dev site
[08/08/2007 02:09:45 PM] Robert Douglas: not for the azrn site
[08/08/2007 02:09:56 PM] Robert Douglas: remember? u were looking into it last night, u said u stayed up until 4am
[08/08/2007 02:09:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think that is an error anymore
[08/08/2007 02:10:24 PM] Robert Douglas: that was the main issue
[08/08/2007 02:10:32 PM] Robert Douglas: the date thing is very minor compared to members not being shown as paid
[08/08/2007 02:11:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not an issue any more but you are welcome to try it
[08/08/2007 02:17:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you testing it?
[08/08/2007 02:18:24 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/08/2007 02:19:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you using a name that already exists in the database?
[08/08/2007 02:19:07 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/08/2007 02:19:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[08/08/2007 02:19:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i am pretending that i am a new user
[08/08/2007 02:19:19 PM] Robert Douglas: it takes me to Renew.php
[08/08/2007 02:19:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: then there should be no problems
[08/08/2007 02:19:24 PM] Robert Douglas: but then asks me to enter my first/last name
[08/08/2007 02:19:55 PM] Robert Douglas: can u please test this out?
[08/08/2007 02:20:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it just takes longer when u make a change, and have to wait for someone else to verify it works
[08/08/2007 02:20:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like it didn't get updated
[08/08/2007 02:20:46 PM] Robert Douglas: u overwrote it
[08/08/2007 02:20:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see a fax column that i removed a long time ago
[08/08/2007 02:20:59 PM] Robert Douglas: that part worked fine last night
[08/08/2007 02:21:08 PM] Robert Douglas: this going back and forth stuff wastes so much time
[08/08/2007 02:21:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the dev server
[08/08/2007 02:21:13 PM] Robert Douglas: you know what the end result is supposed to be
[08/08/2007 02:21:19 PM] Robert Douglas: i have faith you can test it
[08/08/2007 02:21:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah because we can keep our fucking copies straight
[08/08/2007 02:21:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you moved everything over to a live site without even telling me
[08/08/2007 02:21:45 PM] Robert Douglas: feel free to update anything ont he live site
[08/08/2007 02:21:52 PM] Robert Douglas: the site i took it from was a mess lol
[08/08/2007 02:21:56 PM] Robert Douglas: the live site didnt change
[08/08/2007 02:21:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you want me to test things on the dev site, and then move stuff over to a live site
[08/08/2007 02:22:05 PM] Robert Douglas: exactly, that's how it is supposed to work
[08/08/2007 02:22:08 PM] Robert Douglas: test on a dev server
[08/08/2007 02:22:13 PM] Robert Douglas: then upload to the live and test that it works
[08/08/2007 02:22:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[08/08/2007 02:22:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i finish testing on a dev site
[08/08/2007 02:22:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you finish testing on the dev site
[08/08/2007 02:22:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we move it over
[08/08/2007 02:22:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: none of this bullshit with going back and forth testing on dev site, and you testing on live site, then complaining about changed not being made on live site
[08/08/2007 02:23:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to TEST the stuff on the same fucking site i am working on
[08/08/2007 02:23:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i was complaining that it didnt work on the live site
[08/08/2007 02:23:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is how it is supposed to work
[08/08/2007 02:23:16 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/08/2007 02:23:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i tested it on the dev site already
[08/08/2007 02:23:27 PM] Robert Douglas: it worked
[08/08/2007 02:23:34 PM] Robert Douglas: from start to finish
[08/08/2007 02:23:35 PM] Robert Douglas: it worked
[08/08/2007 02:23:46 PM] Robert Douglas: can u please make it work on the live site too?
[08/08/2007 02:24:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know how that file got overwritten i haven't even edited it today
[08/08/2007 02:24:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it was fine yesterday
[08/08/2007 02:24:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just redownloaded it from the server and it had the fax column and wrong header
[08/08/2007 02:25:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: now it works
[08/08/2007 02:25:08 PM] Robert Douglas: the live one does now?
[08/08/2007 02:25:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/08/2007 02:25:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so don't fucking overwrite anything
[08/08/2007 02:25:21 PM] Robert Douglas: i wont
[08/08/2007 02:25:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i havent logged in since i left it working yesterday
[08/08/2007 02:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: is your first and last name Do and Ro?
[08/08/2007 02:26:05 PM] Robert Douglas: can i get the paypal fake pw
[08/08/2007 02:26:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: the ones you used?
[08/08/2007 02:26:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: paypal fake stuff won't work on live site
[08/08/2007 02:26:54 PM] Robert Douglas: why cant u setup the sandbox ont he live site?
[08/08/2007 02:27:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: because the settings file is completely different
[08/08/2007 02:27:17 PM] Robert Douglas: and how did you "test" the live site without having that
[08/08/2007 02:27:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't "test" the live site
[08/08/2007 02:27:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you test the dev site
[08/08/2007 02:27:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember we just talked about this
[08/08/2007 02:28:02 PM] Robert Douglas: so we test the site on one server, put it somewhere else, and give it to the client without testing it on that new server? lol
[08/08/2007 02:28:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: the api isn't the problem
[08/08/2007 02:28:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: the api works
[08/08/2007 02:28:34 PM] Robert Douglas: bjcullinan@bjcullinan.com
[08/08/2007 02:28:41 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have a PP account for that?
[08/08/2007 02:29:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it is having me send payment their
[08/08/2007 02:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually because files got fubared that was from the testing site
[08/08/2007 02:29:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: you need to be paying the clients account
[08/08/2007 02:29:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is it?
[08/08/2007 02:29:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt change the testing site files, nor did i move aroud the files on the live site
[08/08/2007 02:29:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont know, are you saying u overwrote it?
[08/08/2007 02:30:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i had to copy the new renew.php file off the testing site because it got replaced somehow
[08/08/2007 02:30:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what is the clients paypal e-mail?
[08/08/2007 02:30:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont know, it was in the file that i think u overwrote
[08/08/2007 02:30:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: the one that they log into with paypal
[08/08/2007 02:30:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought you had that?
[08/08/2007 02:32:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it info@azradiologyrn.net?
[08/08/2007 02:32:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it might have changed
[08/08/2007 02:32:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: azradiologyrn@yahoo.com
[08/08/2007 02:32:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/08/2007 02:33:02 PM] Robert Douglas: that might be it
[08/08/2007 02:33:10 PM] Robert Douglas: if u try that, it should say if they are verified i think
[08/08/2007 02:35:26 PM] Robert Douglas: since i'm not at home i cant verify
[08/08/2007 02:35:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok now it goes to the right address
[08/08/2007 02:35:31 PM] Robert Douglas: let me call her and see what she says
[08/08/2007 02:35:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: go back to renew.php page

[08/08/2007 02:36:52 PM] Robert Douglas: when i am returned to Details.php
[08/08/2007 02:36:54 PM] Robert Douglas: it shows up blank
[08/08/2007 02:37:26 PM] Robert Douglas: also, I just completeed payment using R Do as first/last name
[08/08/2007 02:37:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i remember we just fixed this problem
[08/08/2007 02:37:32 PM] Robert Douglas: and it still shows up as unpaid
[08/08/2007 02:37:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i think when u were overwriting the files, u didnt put the latest one up
[08/08/2007 02:39:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: how the fuck does this shit happen
[08/08/2007 02:42:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not even executing
[08/08/2007 02:42:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: there must be an error we can't see because yahoo is gay
[08/08/2007 02:44:49 PM] Robert Douglas: it would be great if you could setup a sandbox account
[08/08/2007 02:44:55 PM] Robert Douglas: that way you can test it yourself
[08/08/2007 02:45:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: the text displays no matter what
[08/08/2007 02:45:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: this shit isn't even executing
[08/08/2007 02:45:56 PM] Robert Douglas: verify that the file is not an old version
[08/08/2007 02:45:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: found it
[08/08/2007 02:46:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: your retarded
[08/08/2007 02:46:04 PM] Robert Douglas: because it was an old version when i found the issue
[08/08/2007 02:46:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that page worked when i left it last night
[08/08/2007 02:46:21 PM] Robert Douglas: cant blame your erros on me
[08/08/2007 02:46:25 PM] Robert Douglas: brb
[08/08/2007 02:47:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: two types of quotes were switched around
[08/08/2007 02:47:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it works
[08/08/2007 02:47:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: R Do was updated
[08/08/2007 02:47:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: are we done?
[08/08/2007 02:48:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: can i delete some of these testing accounts?
[08/08/2007 02:49:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesome
[08/08/2007 02:50:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[08/08/2007 02:50:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: your year is 2009
[08/08/2007 02:50:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: because when you first sign up it increased the current year by one
[08/08/2007 02:50:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when you payed it increased it again
[08/08/2007 02:50:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: this has been fixed
[08/08/2007 02:56:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am done with this site

[08/09/2007 10:54:04 AM] Robert Douglas: so we made set hours
[08/09/2007 10:54:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: the issue was you would stop bitching about me being infront of my computer and not having outlook open

[08/09/2007 10:56:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: good for you
[08/09/2007 10:56:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: what is the point of me testing it all the way through if you are just going to do it too?
[08/09/2007 10:57:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: how about you just do it
[08/09/2007 10:57:19 AM] Robert Douglas: because you need to test it to make sure it works, then all i should ahve to do is one final test
[08/09/2007 10:57:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did test it and make sure it works multiple times on the testing server
[08/09/2007 10:57:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: then i had to log in and copy the files over because you couldn't
[08/09/2007 10:57:55 AM] Robert Douglas: yes, but you need to do the same when u upload it to another location
[08/09/2007 10:58:03 AM] Robert Douglas: i copied ALL of the files over that u told me had changed
[08/09/2007 10:58:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: well somehow quotes got messed up on details page and wouldn't even compile
[08/09/2007 10:58:33 AM] Robert Douglas: u cant give the client a live site until you test it
[08/09/2007 10:59:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: it works on testing site, and if i had been in charge of when and how the files got copied to the live site, there would have never been an issue
[08/09/2007 11:00:29 AM] Robert Douglas: i moved every file that needed 2 be moved
[08/09/2007 11:00:38 AM] Robert Douglas: apparently it was more than just that
[08/09/2007 11:00:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok w/e
[08/09/2007 11:00:49 AM] Robert Douglas: if your instructions were 100% there wouldnt have been an issue
[08/09/2007 11:00:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: this process is going to change
[08/09/2007 11:00:56 AM] Robert Douglas: dont try to make it look like it didnt work because of me
[08/09/2007 11:01:03 AM] Robert Douglas: i uploaded the files you mentioned
[08/09/2007 11:02:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: when we start taking on clients we will have a dev site and a live site, and from now on all testing will be done on the dev site, none of this going back bullshit, and when the testing is completed for one feature the entire working copy will be commited to the SVN, and the live site will be copied directly out of the SVN and onto the live site
[08/09/2007 11:02:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: because this entire project has been an absolute pain in the ass trying to figure out what copy is the most current
[08/09/2007 11:06:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: ever get in touch with admins about last correction to the configuration i sent you?
[08/09/2007 11:06:16 AM] Robert Douglas: sec, phone
[08/09/2007 11:16:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: brb shower
[08/09/2007 11:16:42 AM] Robert Douglas: you made a testing folder ont he dev site
[08/09/2007 11:16:46 AM] Robert Douglas: which is where i think the confusion lies
[08/09/2007 11:16:57 AM] Robert Douglas: everything worked on the dev site
[08/09/2007 11:17:09 AM] Robert Douglas: the problem is that if the code works on the dev site, it doesnt mean it will always work on the live site
[08/09/2007 11:17:17 AM] Robert Douglas: that's why you still have to test it out
[08/09/2007 11:20:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: no the problem lies in you made a quotes error when i had you update it, so it was never checking the transactions
[08/09/2007 11:20:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the date problem then i had to fix on both sites
[08/09/2007 11:20:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: it had nothing to do with changing from the 31st to the 1st, you must have just read over it
[08/09/2007 11:21:09 AM] Robert Douglas: i copied the code to have u approve it
[08/09/2007 11:21:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: the 1st problem was on both sites
[08/09/2007 11:21:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: so that was my fault for missing it
[08/09/2007 11:21:24 AM] Robert Douglas: the code i put in their
[08/09/2007 11:21:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: well w/e is solved now
[08/09/2007 11:21:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: so we are done with this damn site?
[08/09/2007 11:21:54 AM] Robert Douglas: hopefully, i tested the full signup and it works
[08/09/2007 11:22:03 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm waiting to hear back from client about her confirmation it works
[08/09/2007 11:22:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/09/2007 11:22:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: now that i don't have a roommate i can finally put up my lesbian kiss poster, yay!
[08/09/2007 11:22:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i find my self staring at it while pondering
[08/09/2007 11:23:06 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/09/2007 11:43:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: so forget the hours for august
[08/09/2007 11:43:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: they are going to change again when i start school
[08/09/2007 11:43:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: and generally i am a lot more reachable now that i have a phone that doesn't suck

[08/09/2007 03:08:52 PM] Robert Douglas: AZRN isnt done
[08/09/2007 03:09:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i found out what the bug is
[08/09/2007 03:09:10 PM] Robert Douglas: with the unpaid members
[08/09/2007 03:09:17 PM] Robert Douglas: u here?
[08/09/2007 03:10:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant talk about too much stuff when i  am at ebay
[08/09/2007 03:10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: basically what happened
[08/09/2007 03:11:19 PM] Robert Douglas: the client emailed all current members
[08/09/2007 03:11:31 PM] Robert Douglas: then every member that was set to expire on 8/31/07 was set to unpaid
[08/09/2007 03:11:45 PM] Robert Douglas: the members that were expiring 08 or 09 stayed current
[08/09/2007 03:12:21 PM] Robert Douglas: it sounds like the email script runs the iterator
[08/09/2007 03:12:51 PM] Robert Douglas: and when the iterator ran, it set everyone who was set to expire at the END of the month (not the beginning), to be unpaid
[08/09/2007 03:26:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what do the members show up as now?
[08/09/2007 03:32:24 PM] Robert Douglas:  on here
[08/09/2007 03:32:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant talk much on phone
[08/09/2007 03:32:43 PM] Robert Douglas: so when the renewal message goes out
[08/09/2007 03:32:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wouldn't be hard to do if there is a set way that you want to display it
[08/09/2007 03:32:53 PM] Robert Douglas: we want to have a message included
[08/09/2007 03:32:55 PM] Robert Douglas: that says
[08/09/2007 03:33:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you want them to be able to use {firstname} for every field?
[08/09/2007 03:33:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you don't then we can just hard code the info at the bottom of the message
[08/09/2007 03:33:48 PM] Robert Douglas: Please review your current information, and contact us if you would like to update any information: 
Phone:  
Address: 
etc...
[08/09/2007 03:33:54 PM] Robert Douglas: we want that on the renewal email
[08/09/2007 03:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it would be hard coded?
[08/09/2007 03:34:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: the client can't change that part?
[08/09/2007 03:34:18 PM] Robert Douglas: the client can change it
[08/09/2007 03:34:30 PM] Robert Douglas: but we'll put it up their for now
[08/09/2007 03:34:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they would have to use {phone} {address} {etc}
[08/09/2007 03:34:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/09/2007 03:34:46 PM] Robert Douglas: exactly
[08/09/2007 03:34:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can do it
[08/09/2007 03:34:55 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/09/2007 03:35:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: not too hard i just need to expand the replacement array
[08/09/2007 03:35:07 PM] Robert Douglas: cool
[08/09/2007 03:35:17 PM] Robert Douglas: there was 1 other thing i think too

[08/09/2007 03:35:36 PM] Robert Douglas: fax still displays, that might have been my fault for not removing it
[08/09/2007 03:35:39 PM] Robert Douglas: but the member number is off
[08/09/2007 03:35:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll remove it too
[08/09/2007 03:35:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it shows member number of 0600
[08/09/2007 03:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is it supposed to be?
[08/09/2007 03:37:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: 6000?
[08/09/2007 03:37:45 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be tghe last member that is ont he list
[08/09/2007 03:37:52 PM] Robert Douglas: let me try 2 look i tup
[08/09/2007 03:38:37 PM] Robert Douglas: 06114
[08/09/2007 03:38:41 PM] Robert Douglas: that looks like the last one to me
[08/09/2007 03:38:50 PM] Robert Douglas: the DB is supposed to increment tho
[08/09/2007 03:41:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: see it is checking for the first available number and 6000 doesn't exist, so its trying to insert a number at that one
[08/09/2007 03:42:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: should it just check for the highest number and add 1 to that?
[08/09/2007 03:42:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/09/2007 03:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: now it shows 6117
[08/09/2007 03:45:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is what you are looking for
[08/09/2007 03:48:04 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, it is supposed to be the next highest number
[08/09/2007 03:48:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/09/2007 03:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only requirement for this information fields in the e-mails is that the field is all lowercase, is that OK?
[08/09/2007 03:48:57 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[08/09/2007 03:49:05 PM] Robert Douglas: the client wont change that part at all
[08/09/2007 03:49:39 PM] Robert Douglas: can u log into the jambonie cpanel and remove the password protect directory thing
[08/09/2007 03:49:48 PM] Robert Douglas: if you're familiar with it that is
[08/09/2007 03:49:56 PM] Robert Douglas: they decided to take it off
[08/09/2007 03:50:01 PM] Robert Douglas: and ebay blockst he cpanel port
[08/09/2007 03:50:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it in cpanel?
[08/09/2007 03:50:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/09/2007 03:50:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will try to find it
[08/09/2007 03:50:56 PM] Robert Douglas: cpanel > password protect directories > click public_html > uncheck the checkbox and save
[08/09/2007 03:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/09/2007 03:52:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you in their database?
[08/09/2007 03:53:08 PM] Robert Douglas: what do u mean

[08/09/2007 03:54:26 PM] Robert Douglas: hard code it
[08/09/2007 03:54:40 PM] Robert Douglas: that way when we are testing, nobody will be able to receive an email in case someone makes a mistake
[08/09/2007 03:54:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah yeah good call
[08/09/2007 03:57:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like it works
[08/09/2007 03:58:36 PM] Robert Douglas: so on the 31st
[08/09/2007 03:58:44 PM] Robert Douglas: everyone who expires on that day will receive an email?
[08/09/2007 03:58:48 PM] Robert Douglas: or is it the day after?
[08/09/2007 03:58:54 PM] Robert Douglas: and by email i mean expired email
[08/09/2007 03:59:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes on that day expired e-mail
[08/09/2007 04:02:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: well looks like everything works

[08/09/2007 04:33:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/09/2007 04:33:35 PM] Robert Douglas: can you verify that this is still correct?  
" Members will receive the renewal E-mail 1 month before the renewal date. 
Members will receive the membership expired e-mail 1 month after they miss the renewal date."
[08/09/2007 04:34:04 PM] Robert Douglas: also, do u know if we can setup a cron job on the rps account that will run the azrn iterator script?
[08/09/2007 04:34:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: one thing at a time
[08/09/2007 04:34:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: sec
[08/09/2007 04:34:18 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[08/09/2007 04:37:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: your last statement is partly true
[08/09/2007 04:38:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: they recieve their expiration e-mail on the day of the expiration
[08/09/2007 04:38:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are removed from members 1 month after they have been expired
[08/09/2007 04:38:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: so yes it is one month after their renewal date
[08/09/2007 04:38:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is true actually
[08/09/2007 04:38:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: because the renewal date is 1 month before the actual expiration date
[08/09/2007 04:39:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you are right
[08/09/2007 04:39:16 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool

[08/09/2007 04:39:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: you only had active and inactive there
[08/09/2007 04:40:16 PM] Robert Douglas: thats because unpaid wasnt labeled correctly
[08/09/2007 04:40:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: so no it does not
[08/09/2007 04:40:41 PM] Robert Douglas: since the pink color's definition changed, that print page will need to be updated

[08/11/2007 11:39:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Other/bfd2.gif)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Other/bfd2.gif
[08/11/2007 11:39:57 AM] Robert Douglas: i always hated the way ebay looked
[08/11/2007 11:40:02 AM] Robert Douglas: looks much cleaner now imo
[08/11/2007 11:40:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: looks the same as before
[08/11/2007 11:40:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: stiff advertisements every fuckin where
[08/11/2007 11:40:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: its still too skinny
[08/11/2007 11:40:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: they should increas the width by like 100 pixels
[08/11/2007 11:40:50 AM] Robert Douglas: the new one only has ONE ad
[08/11/2007 11:41:07 AM] Robert Douglas: u r the first person who said it looks the same
[08/11/2007 11:41:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is the 2 thousands people with 800x600 sized screens shouldn't be allowed on the internet
[08/11/2007 11:41:16 AM] Robert Douglas: everyone else was like "damn that looks lots better"
[08/11/2007 11:41:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: they should be confined to windows 98 games like hearts and pinball
[08/11/2007 11:41:39 AM] Robert Douglas: ebay makes over a million a year from people running webTV
[08/11/2007 11:42:00 AM] Robert Douglas: their site needs to be very robust
[08/11/2007 11:42:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah maybe i just expected more from a company that makes millions a year
[08/11/2007 11:42:51 AM] Robert Douglas: making a dramastic change to the look can actually have bad results
[08/11/2007 11:42:59 AM] Robert Douglas: because everyone that is so used to the old feel
[08/11/2007 11:43:02 AM] Robert Douglas: will be scared
[08/11/2007 11:43:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: but thats not impressive to me, my dad makes 2.5 million in previous years to this one where hes making probably around 3.5, who knows how much his actual company makes
[08/11/2007 11:43:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: our website is prettier
[08/11/2007 11:44:08 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but ebay's new homepage is customer centric
[08/11/2007 11:44:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: they have the little MS dragging dots next to every heading, wtf i can't actually drag the boxes around

[08/11/2007 11:55:38 AM] Robert Douglas: yup
[08/11/2007 11:55:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know alex he probably just thought it was new because he hadn't been there in a while
[08/11/2007 11:55:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: and he is computer dumb
[08/11/2007 11:55:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably didn't even try to open the regular one and compare
[08/11/2007 11:56:01 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/11/2007 11:56:06 AM] Robert Douglas: probably

[08/11/2007 11:59:13 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/11/2007 12:22:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: once we get offices, we should allow our employees a little rope length, like google does
[08/11/2007 12:23:02 PM] Robert Douglas: rope lenght?
[08/11/2007 12:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: like have some team building stuff, like for 30 minutes after lunch break we all play counterstrike
[08/11/2007 12:23:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: its constructive and teaches how to work as a team
[08/11/2007 12:24:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol this guy is getting kicked, and you can only kick by name, so he keeps changing his name to like a wave of ......Renamed to.......
[08/11/2007 12:26:42 PM] Robert Douglas: counterstrike is great
[08/11/2007 12:26:45 PM] Robert Douglas: alex doesnt like that game tho
[08/11/2007 12:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we will play urban terror
[08/11/2007 12:27:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a quake 3 mod
[08/11/2007 12:27:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: better then counterstrike
[08/11/2007 12:27:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have never played counterstrike where you actually respawn in the same round
[08/11/2007 12:27:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i like CSS
[08/11/2007 12:27:37 PM] Robert Douglas: there is a deathmatch mod
[08/11/2007 12:27:39 PM] Robert Douglas: for CSS
[08/11/2007 12:27:45 PM] Robert Douglas: where u respawn everytime you die
[08/11/2007 12:27:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about capture the flag?
[08/11/2007 12:27:53 PM] Robert Douglas: there is a mod for that too
[08/11/2007 12:28:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: quake 3 is so much more fast paced, by default
[08/11/2007 12:28:09 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/11/2007 12:28:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like it a lot more then CS
[08/11/2007 12:28:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i love the physics in HL2
[08/11/2007 12:28:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just like the HL2 deathmatch it r0x
[08/11/2007 12:29:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: brb going to check mail
[08/11/2007 12:29:37 PM] Robert Douglas:  Members will receive the renewal E-mail 1 month before the renewal date. 
Members will receive the membership expired e-mail 1 month after they miss the renewal date.
[08/11/2007 12:29:42 PM] Robert Douglas: that last one doesnt sound correct
[08/11/2007 12:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/11/2007 12:29:56 PM] Robert Douglas: because they dont receive it 1 month after the renewal date
[08/11/2007 12:30:07 PM] Robert Douglas: right? they receive it 1 day after the miss of renewing
[08/11/2007 12:30:11 PM] Robert Douglas: so the day the member expires
[08/11/2007 12:30:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: its doesn't really work like that
[08/11/2007 12:30:32 PM] Robert Douglas: can u clarify when the expired is sent
[08/11/2007 12:30:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: they recieve the renewal e-mail 1 month before expire date
 they receive the expire e-mail on the expire date
[08/11/2007 12:31:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, so what is on the front pag enow, is incorrect
[08/11/2007 12:31:31 PM] Robert Douglas: Members will receive the membership expired e-mail the day their membership expires.
[08/11/2007 12:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: its based on expire date, the way you are saying it makes it sound like it is based on renewal date
[08/11/2007 12:31:45 PM] Robert Douglas: can u change "Members will receive the membership expired e-mail 1 month after they miss the renewal date." to "Members will receive the membership expired e-mail the day their membership expires."
[08/11/2007 12:32:35 PM] Robert Douglas: it is ont he index.php page
[08/11/2007 12:36:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: site index page?

[08/11/2007 12:37:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there an ftp mod for windows
[08/11/2007 12:38:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: like something that keeps track of accounts that plugs into the menus in explorer
[08/11/2007 12:38:02 PM] Robert Douglas: can u have the script run and hard code the renewal email to go to bobbydouglas@cox.net?
[08/11/2007 12:38:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: like hot tortoise does
[08/11/2007 12:38:29 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, i want the script to act like it normally would, but i want to receive the email message
[08/11/2007 12:38:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator?
[08/11/2007 12:38:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/11/2007 12:38:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure give me a sec

[08/11/2007 12:42:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahhhh i can turn it off
[08/11/2007 12:42:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking skeet
[08/11/2007 12:43:28 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/11/2007 12:43:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: iterator showed up blank
[08/11/2007 12:43:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that's not good
[08/11/2007 12:43:57 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/11/2007 12:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: not compiling
[08/11/2007 12:44:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i could see the compile error
[08/11/2007 12:44:39 PM] Robert Douglas: make sure the to from email addy is correct
[08/11/2007 12:44:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but yahoo is fucking gay
[08/11/2007 12:44:42 PM] Robert Douglas: that was our issue earlier
[08/11/2007 12:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: no it would still print out names
[08/11/2007 12:45:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i made it print the entire members array
[08/11/2007 12:45:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its definitely not compiling
[08/11/2007 12:46:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: isn't there any fucking way for me to turn on error reporting?
[08/11/2007 12:46:38 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[08/11/2007 12:46:46 PM] Robert Douglas: isnt there a php.ini flag
[08/11/2007 12:46:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/11/2007 12:46:53 PM] Robert Douglas: that u can put in a .htaccess file or something
[08/11/2007 12:47:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it only works if the script compiles
[08/11/2007 12:47:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: otherwise you have to do it in the original config
[08/11/2007 12:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahh your right
[08/11/2007 12:47:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll try that

[08/11/2007 01:02:04 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/11/2007 01:02:05 PM] Robert Douglas: what was it
[08/11/2007 01:02:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: an include was failing
[08/11/2007 01:04:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: it deleted some members
[08/11/2007 01:05:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope there is a backup
[08/11/2007 01:06:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it did what it was supposed to
[08/11/2007 01:06:15 PM] Robert Douglas: what memebers did it delete?
[08/11/2007 01:06:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: except now the database is fucked up because it changed the status, but sent all the e-mails to you
[08/11/2007 01:06:40 PM] *** Your previous message has not been sent.  Reason: Maximum length exceeded.  You can recall the last message typed with Ctrl-Up or Up, depending on settings.
[08/11/2007 01:06:56 PM] Robert Douglas: well i'm glad we're testing that now lol
[08/11/2007 01:07:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: no it would have worked properly
[08/11/2007 01:07:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: if it had sent the renewal to the right address
[08/11/2007 01:07:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: what i am saying is it changes the status when it sends the renewal email
[08/11/2007 01:07:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it sent them all to you because you asked me to hard code it
[08/11/2007 01:07:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i have a backup of it
[08/11/2007 01:08:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and not i have to go fix the status and change them all back so that the renewal goes the the right people
[08/11/2007 01:08:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: *now
[08/11/2007 01:08:25 PM] Robert Douglas: so ur saying the members that received the renewal email were deleted?
[08/11/2007 01:08:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[08/11/2007 01:08:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am saying the expired member are now deleted
[08/11/2007 01:08:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: the renewal members status changed, but they never get the e-mail because it was sent to you
[08/11/2007 01:09:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: check your inbox
[08/11/2007 01:09:09 PM] Robert Douglas: so if it wasnt sent to me, the expired members would NOT have been deleted, correct?
[08/11/2007 01:09:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, deleting expired members is a seperate process
[08/11/2007 01:09:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you didn't get any e-mails then there is something wrong with the IF statement
[08/11/2007 01:09:55 PM] Robert Douglas: so when are members supposed to be deleted?
[08/11/2007 01:09:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i got the emails
[08/11/2007 01:10:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[08/11/2007 01:10:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so nothing is wrong the entire script worked properly
[08/11/2007 01:10:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: except that none of the renewal members got their email because they were all sent to you
[08/11/2007 01:10:53 PM] Robert Douglas: if the script was working fine we wouldnt have to be restoring the db right now lol
[08/11/2007 01:11:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are missing the point
[08/11/2007 01:12:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do you determine if a member has been sent an e-mail on the previous run through of the iterator.php
[08/11/2007 01:12:30 PM] Robert Douglas: also, the renewal email that was sent doesnt contain the extra bits of info 
[08/11/2007 01:12:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: if it is supposed to run every night, then it would send an e-mail out to everyone ever single night
[08/11/2007 01:12:35 PM] Robert Douglas: like the email, address, etc..
[08/11/2007 01:12:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes it doesn't contain it because they weren't used in the email template
[08/11/2007 01:13:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: now let me explain
[08/11/2007 01:13:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i know what u mean, but either the script has the issue, or the issue is that u shouldnt have hard coded my emial and sent it off if it was going to mess up the db
[08/11/2007 01:13:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no issue aside from you asking me to hard code your e-mail in it
[08/11/2007 01:13:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: now let me explain
[08/11/2007 01:13:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me explain
[08/11/2007 01:13:53 PM] Robert Douglas: by hard coding it, your script messed up the DB
[08/11/2007 01:13:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see you typing
[08/11/2007 01:13:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i understand the logic behind it
[08/11/2007 01:14:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: now stop and let me explain
[08/11/2007 01:14:06 PM] Robert Douglas: the script changes the status value
[08/11/2007 01:14:12 PM] Robert Douglas: but that's besides the point
[08/11/2007 01:14:27 PM] Robert Douglas: the script worked the way it was supposed to work, but there is a flaw somewhere, ebcause the db is now messed up
[08/11/2007 01:14:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're and idiot
[08/11/2007 01:16:07 PM] Robert Douglas: what u did messed up the DB, why cant u just accept that that isn't good?
[08/11/2007 01:16:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: omg
[08/11/2007 01:16:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: the status is changed when the renewal e-mail is sent, and since i replaced your e-mail instead of the members e-mail, it sent all the e-mails to you, instead of the member, at the same time it changed the status in the DB to "renewal e-mail sent", now the next time the script runs, it will think all those users already got the renewal e-mail so it won't send it again, the next e-mail it sends will be the expired e-mail
[08/11/2007 01:16:38 PM] Robert Douglas: that's great
[08/11/2007 01:16:41 PM] Robert Douglas: the issue still exists...

[08/12/2007 10:51:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only see one patty in the list
[08/12/2007 10:51:48 PM] Robert Douglas: Patricia Van Marche
[08/12/2007 10:52:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: she is confirmed
[08/12/2007 10:52:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i think the problem was
[08/12/2007 10:52:14 PM] Robert Douglas: Patty
[08/12/2007 10:52:16 PM] Robert Douglas: was one user
[08/12/2007 10:52:19 PM] Robert Douglas: and Patricia was another
[08/12/2007 10:52:20 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/12/2007 10:52:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: with the same last name?
[08/12/2007 10:52:31 PM] Robert Douglas: same last name
[08/12/2007 10:52:47 PM] Robert Douglas: Patty Van Marche 
Patricia Van Marche
[08/12/2007 10:52:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think at this point it is only user errors
[08/12/2007 10:53:12 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/12/2007 10:53:16 PM] Robert Douglas: but we should change the renew.php page
[08/12/2007 10:53:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and do what?
[08/12/2007 10:53:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i mean the new member page
[08/12/2007 10:53:51 PM] Robert Douglas: and say
[08/12/2007 10:53:55 PM] Robert Douglas: For Renewals
[08/12/2007 10:53:56 PM] Robert Douglas: go here
[08/12/2007 10:54:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i can add that now if you like
[08/12/2007 10:57:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i would be able to change it but that new password isn't working for me
[08/12/2007 10:57:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait i got it
[08/12/2007 10:58:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll get the exact html for ya
[08/12/2007 10:58:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i added it
[08/12/2007 10:58:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless you'd like something different
[08/12/2007 10:58:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/Membership-Signup.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/Membership-Signup.php
[08/12/2007 10:58:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe copy it to the bottom of the form too?
[08/12/2007 11:03:08 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/12/2007 11:03:48 PM] Robert Douglas: also, can u have the script check the Membership Signup to make sure that there are not duplicate first/last name entries
[08/12/2007 11:04:05 PM] Robert Douglas: so Patty Van Marche cant signup as a new member twice under the name "Patty Van Marche"
[08/12/2007 11:10:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: done
[08/12/2007 11:11:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/12/2007 11:11:32 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea if we can run the iterator from our RPS cron job stuff
[08/12/2007 11:11:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we use the yahoo DB remotely
[08/12/2007 11:11:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: OR
[08/12/2007 11:12:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: if a php script can load another php page remotely
[08/12/2007 11:12:20 PM] Robert Douglas: for the error msg of the "Member already exists, please signup using another name, or click here if you are trying to renew your membership."
[08/12/2007 11:13:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made it based on last name OR email
[08/12/2007 11:13:58 PM] Robert Douglas: nice
[08/12/2007 11:14:02 PM] Robert Douglas: actually
[08/12/2007 11:14:04 PM] Robert Douglas: do last name only
[08/12/2007 11:14:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i mean
[08/12/2007 11:14:11 PM] Robert Douglas: first and last
[08/12/2007 11:14:13 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[08/12/2007 11:14:16 PM] Robert Douglas: or nvm
[08/12/2007 11:14:51 PM] Robert Douglas: u cant do last name OR email
[08/12/2007 11:14:56 PM] Robert Douglas: because husband and wife
[08/12/2007 11:14:59 PM] Robert Douglas: or ppl with 2 last names
[08/12/2007 11:15:02 PM] Robert Douglas: can still signup
[08/12/2007 11:15:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: with the same e-mail address?
[08/12/2007 11:15:16 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/12/2007 11:15:21 PM] Robert Douglas: just do first and last name
[08/12/2007 11:15:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: how would it compare that?
[08/12/2007 11:16:02 PM] Robert Douglas: if firstname = post[firstname] && lastname = post[lastname]
[08/12/2007 11:16:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: patty van marche is first and last which is completely different from patricia van marche
[08/12/2007 11:16:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it has to be based on something that they will enter the same as someone else
[08/12/2007 11:16:28 PM] Robert Douglas: keep it simple
[08/12/2007 11:16:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: not predict if they are the same people
[08/12/2007 11:16:35 PM] Robert Douglas: just do first/last name
[08/12/2007 11:16:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't understand
[08/12/2007 11:16:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: how would it possibly know it patty and patricia are different people?
[08/12/2007 11:17:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: the last name is the only thing that is the same
[08/12/2007 11:17:06 PM] Robert Douglas: it wont
[08/12/2007 11:17:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: it can't be last and first
[08/12/2007 11:17:12 PM] Robert Douglas: and we wont care about that person
[08/12/2007 11:17:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: because they could enter different first name
[08/12/2007 11:17:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: s
[08/12/2007 11:17:32 PM] Robert Douglas: correct, so we will let them be duplicates then
[08/12/2007 11:17:37 PM] Robert Douglas: if they dont enter correct first/lastname
[08/12/2007 11:17:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it supposed to know every single alternate name for every other name?
[08/12/2007 11:17:51 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/12/2007 11:17:54 PM] Robert Douglas: the only change i want
[08/12/2007 11:17:58 PM] Robert Douglas: is to make a check for first/last name
[08/12/2007 11:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/12/2007 11:18:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't solve the problem we had before
[08/12/2007 11:18:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i understand
[08/12/2007 11:19:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: done
[08/12/2007 11:20:27 PM] Robert Douglas: thx
[08/12/2007 11:20:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: are we done with this bloody project now?
[08/12/2007 11:20:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am getting tired of it
[08/12/2007 11:20:40 PM] Robert Douglas: gotta get the iteratorworking
[08/12/2007 11:20:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: not my problem
[08/12/2007 11:20:47 PM] Robert Douglas: and then do a test
[08/12/2007 11:20:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and definitely not tonight
[08/12/2007 11:21:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to bed
[08/12/2007 11:21:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yes it is, if iterator wont work
[08/12/2007 11:21:07 PM] Robert Douglas: then db isnt 100%
[08/12/2007 11:21:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: if the iterator won't work then its their fucking problem for not hosting with us and for yahoo sucking balls
[08/12/2007 11:21:41 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant tell the client that
[08/12/2007 11:22:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already tried logging into the database remotely, and it blocked me
[08/12/2007 11:22:43 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe we make a cron on RPS that changes the header to the iterator?
[08/12/2007 11:22:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you will have to find out if PHP can load a remote page
[08/12/2007 11:24:10 PM] Robert Douglas: what about changing the headerof a php page
[08/12/2007 11:24:25 PM] Robert Douglas: so setup a cron on php
[08/12/2007 11:24:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i mean on the rps site
[08/12/2007 11:24:39 PM] Robert Douglas: and on that page
[08/12/2007 11:24:46 PM] Robert Douglas: it changes the header to go to the azrn iterator
[08/12/2007 11:24:48 PM] Robert Douglas: will that work?
[08/12/2007 11:25:07 PM] Robert Douglas: or do u know if we can create a cron that visits a URL
[08/12/2007 11:25:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://us3.php.net/manual/en/features.remote-files.php)http://us3.php.net/manual/en/features.remote-files.php
[08/12/2007 11:25:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: first example
[08/12/2007 11:25:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will need the iterator to run a script that opens the remote iterator
[08/12/2007 11:25:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it might be easier to just setup the location of the pph page int he cron
[08/12/2007 11:26:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so
[08/12/2007 11:26:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think the cron can go to a remote page
[08/12/2007 11:26:05 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azrn.com/iterator.php)http://azrn.com/iterator.php
[08/12/2007 11:26:11 PM] Robert Douglas: that might be better to find out
[08/12/2007 11:26:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: cron runs a cli command i will look into it tomorrow
[08/12/2007 11:26:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: how much is this client fucking paying us?
[08/12/2007 11:27:02 PM] Robert Douglas: more than enough to not have to deal this crap
[08/12/2007 11:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: more then enough?
[08/12/2007 11:27:39 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, it just felt like this project was rushed
[08/12/2007 11:28:05 PM] Robert Douglas: should have been done long ago
[08/12/2007 11:28:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: this project was done poorly and is now extended this fucking long because i didn't know how to use paypal
[08/12/2007 11:28:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should have never done it in the first place
[08/12/2007 11:28:56 PM] Robert Douglas: with Yahoo, the gay shit is crons cant be setup, and you have to have the from address be the address associated with the account
[08/12/2007 11:29:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should have hired someone else to do it, then i could have learned from their code
[08/12/2007 11:29:03 PM] Robert Douglas: those are the only 2 limitations with yahoo
[08/12/2007 11:29:58 PM] Robert Douglas: so let's just finish this up, and put it all to rest
[08/12/2007 11:30:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you said this project would be easy when i started it, you said it would take me a fucking weekend, you said make the database print out all these fields, i never even got a fucking project spec
[08/12/2007 11:30:53 PM] Robert Douglas: it should have been a very simple project
[08/12/2007 11:31:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: you shoul;d have hired someone that knew paypal
[08/12/2007 11:31:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never even gave you a quote, how much do you plan to pay me for all this bullshit?
[08/12/2007 11:31:35 PM] Robert Douglas: if i thought you werent able to do it, then i would have
[08/12/2007 11:31:46 PM] Robert Douglas: we said $100 awhile ago
[08/12/2007 11:31:54 PM] Robert Douglas: but i think alex will pay u a little more
[08/12/2007 11:32:46 PM] Robert Douglas: when someone tries to signup and the first/last name exist, what's the error message that displays?
[08/12/2007 11:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: the one you gave me
[08/12/2007 11:33:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: [08/12/2007 11:12:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: if a php script can load another php page remotely
 [08/12/2007 11:12:20 PM] Robert Douglas: for the error msg of the "Member already exists, please signup using another name, or click here if you are trying to renew your membership."
[08/12/2007 11:33:42 PM] Robert Douglas: k thx
[08/12/2007 11:36:52 PM] Robert Douglas: ineed to modify member signup
[08/12/2007 11:36:56 PM] Robert Douglas: want me to tell u corrections
[08/12/2007 11:37:00 PM] Robert Douglas: or should i just do it
[08/12/2007 11:37:58 PM] Robert Douglas: i am updating Membership-Signup.php Details.php
[08/12/2007 11:38:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: go ahead
[08/12/2007 11:39:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: $100 dollars?
[08/12/2007 11:39:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have put a lot more then 20 hours into this stupid ass project, and my time is worth a lot more then $5 dollars an hour
[08/12/2007 11:41:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so here is my suggestion, log into yahoo and figure out if you can allow remote access to the DB, if so, then a simple change to the setting.php on our server should do the trick, and you can copy over the cron information from the dev account, also you will need to use the same constants.php and Details.php file from the dbadmin section since those are included in the iterator, and since you are using details.php you will also need caller.php
[08/12/2007 11:41:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and since you have IM history you can refer back to this later when setting it up
[08/12/2007 11:42:01 PM] Robert Douglas: much easier to not have to do that
[08/12/2007 11:42:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to bed
[08/12/2007 11:42:12 PM] Robert Douglas: would be better to have the iterator run from the yahoo server
[08/12/2007 11:42:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: well we don't have much of a choice
[08/12/2007 11:42:26 PM] Robert Douglas: why cant u use th efopen stuff
[08/12/2007 11:42:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think it supports login passwords and such
[08/12/2007 11:42:58 PM] Robert Douglas: we can put the iterator in a page without a pw
[08/12/2007 11:43:05 PM] Robert Douglas: just name it Iterator904343434534.php
[08/12/2007 11:43:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would work
[08/12/2007 11:43:10 PM] Robert Douglas: nobody will be able to figure it out
[08/12/2007 11:43:13 PM] Robert Douglas: and it will be much much easier
[08/12/2007 11:43:19 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[08/12/2007 11:43:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: $file = fopen ("(Link: http://www.example.com/)http://www.example.com/", "r");
 
[08/12/2007 11:43:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats all you need
[08/12/2007 11:43:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: point the address to the iterator
[08/12/2007 11:43:44 PM] Robert Douglas: are u sure everything will work?
[08/12/2007 11:43:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and run that with the cron
[08/12/2007 11:44:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have no idea
[08/12/2007 11:44:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've never tried a remote open
[08/12/2007 11:44:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but they say it will work on that page
[08/12/2007 11:44:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i would assume that php would not have the functionality if it did not work
[08/12/2007 11:45:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i updated member signup and details
[08/12/2007 11:45:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm sure that works, but i'm wondering if the site will work if we run the iterator
[08/12/2007 11:45:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator.php works
[08/12/2007 11:46:08 PM] Robert Douglas: you are sure nothing else will mess up?
[08/12/2007 11:47:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want to have it fuck up
[08/12/2007 11:47:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i want this to work
[08/12/2007 11:47:17 PM] Robert Douglas: and i want u to put your time in more important projects
[08/12/2007 11:47:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: well nvm, its not working
[08/12/2007 11:49:47 PM] Robert Douglas: i just got a ton of emails
[08/12/2007 11:49:53 PM] Robert Douglas: do i need to reload the DB again? or is it ok?
[08/12/2007 11:51:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: still trying to figure that out
[08/12/2007 11:51:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: unfortunately programming a website with no fucking god damn error information is not an exact science like it should fucking be
[08/12/2007 11:54:18 PM] Robert Douglas: let me know if i need to reload the db
[08/12/2007 11:54:22 PM] Robert Douglas: it only takes a min
[08/12/2007 11:54:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i have the SQL still opened
[08/12/2007 11:55:17 PM] Robert Douglas: got emails again
[08/12/2007 11:55:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[08/12/2007 11:55:41 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[08/12/2007 11:56:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: now it finally seems to be working
[08/12/2007 11:56:44 PM] Robert Douglas: what did u change?
[08/12/2007 11:56:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i change back your hardcoded e-mail address?
[08/12/2007 11:56:57 PM] Robert Douglas: not yet
[08/12/2007 11:57:03 PM] Robert Douglas: 1. do i need to reload the db?
[08/12/2007 11:57:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: some fucking problem with including the Details.php page to update the database
[08/12/2007 11:57:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: no you don't need to reload DB
[08/12/2007 11:57:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: despite the e-mails the DB was not changed
[08/12/2007 11:57:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yahoo is fucking gay
[08/12/2007 11:58:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to call technical support and figure out if there is a way to turn on error reporting
[08/13/2007 12:00:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: but first i need to go to bed
[08/13/2007 12:01:05 AM] Robert Douglas: can u wait 2 mins
[08/13/2007 12:01:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you set up that cron code, very simple 1 liner and copy the cron stuff off the dev site
[08/13/2007 12:01:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: and when you run it and get to e-mails tomorrow call me and i'll change the code back to being active
[08/13/2007 12:01:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am getting cranky
[08/13/2007 12:01:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you want to put up with me when i am cranky then i can wait
[08/13/2007 12:03:17 AM] Robert Douglas: can u run the iterator again and have it go to my email
[08/13/2007 12:03:20 AM] Robert Douglas: i want to test something
[08/13/2007 12:03:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: done
[08/13/2007 12:07:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: done?
[08/13/2007 12:07:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/Iterator.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/Iterator.php
[08/13/2007 12:09:59 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/13/2007 12:10:14 AM] Robert Douglas: can u move it to (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/Iterator8974887634943.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/Iterator8974887634943.php 

[08/13/2007 12:10:25 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/Iterator8974887634943.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/Iterator8974887634943.php 

[08/13/2007 12:10:33 AM] Robert Douglas: and update the pages that require the update
[08/13/2007 12:10:37 AM] Robert Douglas: then i'll do the rest
[08/13/2007 12:10:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: nothing includes the iterator.php it only includes other stuff
[08/13/2007 12:11:12 AM] Robert Douglas: but i thought iterator runs when you send out a mass email to everyone??
[08/13/2007 12:11:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: it includes other stuff to send e-mails
[08/13/2007 12:11:53 AM] Robert Douglas: right, but when the client sent out an email using, you are saying it did NOT run the iterator
[08/13/2007 12:12:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: when the client sent out an e-mail from the view-modify member page it does not run the iterator
[08/13/2007 12:12:44 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/13/2007 12:14:08 AM] Robert Douglas: k, it is uploaded to Iterator8974887634943.php
[08/13/2007 12:14:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: affirmative
[08/13/2007 12:20:42 AM] Robert Douglas: how often should i have it run?
[08/13/2007 12:20:45 AM] Robert Douglas: once a day?
[08/13/2007 12:20:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/13/2007 12:21:00 AM] Robert Douglas: can u give me the php code to use for the fopen
[08/13/2007 12:21:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: sec
[08/13/2007 12:21:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: <?php
 $file = fopen ("(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/Iterator8974887634943.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/Iterator8974887634943.php", "r");
 ?>
[08/13/2007 12:21:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: that has to be in a file
[08/13/2007 12:22:04 AM] Robert Douglas: every time i visit the iterator, it says it sent out a renewal email
[08/13/2007 12:22:09 AM] Robert Douglas: but i dont receive it
[08/13/2007 12:22:17 AM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt show up under bobbydouglas@cox.net
[08/13/2007 12:22:19 AM] Robert Douglas: like u had it before
[08/13/2007 12:23:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you were receiving it before?
[08/13/2007 12:23:12 AM] Robert Douglas: yes
[08/13/2007 12:23:17 AM] Robert Douglas: Renewal e-mail sent to shsaja20@aol.com 
Renewal e-mail sent to bofaye@hotmail.com 
Renewal e-mail sent to craigcarolyn70@msn.com

Renewal e-mai
[08/13/2007 12:23:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: how many times?
[08/13/2007 12:23:53 AM] Robert Douglas: i used to receive every email
[08/13/2007 12:23:55 AM] Robert Douglas: now i receive none
[08/13/2007 12:24:05 AM] Robert Douglas: i ran the iterator 3 times
[08/13/2007 12:24:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: well either cox is blocking it, or the iterator is having errors that aren't displaying
[08/13/2007 12:24:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: either way its not my problem anymore
[08/13/2007 12:24:28 AM] Robert Douglas: so u still have my email as hard coded?
[08/13/2007 12:24:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/13/2007 12:24:44 AM] Robert Douglas: cox isnt blocking it
[08/13/2007 12:24:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: if there are errors that aren't being displayed then i can no longer work on this website
[08/13/2007 12:25:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i have done everything i know how to do
[08/13/2007 12:25:17 AM] Robert Douglas: why does the iterator say it sent out a renewal email?
[08/13/2007 12:25:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is the same code as before but in a different directory
[08/13/2007 12:25:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: because there is a print_r() printing out all the e-mails that it thinks it sends too
[08/13/2007 12:25:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, if i don't get error reporting i can't fix it
[08/13/2007 12:25:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am done
[08/13/2007 12:26:08 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, so i need to tell the client the site STILL isnt working
[08/13/2007 12:26:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: feel free to figure out how to report errors
[08/13/2007 12:26:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess so
[08/13/2007 12:26:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: you need to tell the client that the site would be working if i could see errors
[08/13/2007 12:26:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: but until then, i am done
[08/13/2007 12:26:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was working tonight
[08/13/2007 12:26:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: you asked to me put it in a different directory and it stopped working
[08/13/2007 12:26:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am done
[08/13/2007 12:27:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: shit like this makes me not want to be a programmer anymore
[08/13/2007 12:27:14 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i can see why
[08/13/2007 12:27:23 AM] Robert Douglas: it should work no matter the location of the file
[08/13/2007 12:27:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: figure out why yahoo doesn't display errors and if three are errors showing up, i will fix it
[08/13/2007 12:27:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i changed the directory location, and i changed the include path to match, it compile fine
[08/13/2007 12:28:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it if is not displaying errors when there are some, i don't know what else to do
[08/13/2007 12:28:29 AM] Robert Douglas: there is a possibility that we sent out too many emails
[08/13/2007 12:28:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: tell me if you get emails, i will run the dbadmin iterator again
[08/13/2007 12:28:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: ready?
[08/13/2007 12:28:34 AM] Robert Douglas: and yahoo is limiting that part
[08/13/2007 12:28:40 AM] Robert Douglas: yes rdy
[08/13/2007 12:28:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: this will test that theory too
[08/13/2007 12:28:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you get e-mails?
[08/13/2007 12:28:59 AM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/13/2007 12:29:09 AM] Robert Douglas: so most likely itis just that the email shit has been limited
[08/13/2007 12:29:12 AM] Robert Douglas: lets test more tomorrow
[08/13/2007 12:29:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: how about now?
[08/13/2007 12:29:29 AM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/13/2007 12:29:47 AM] Robert Douglas: lets go to bed and work on it tomorrow
[08/13/2007 12:29:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i have no idea what could be wrong
[08/13/2007 12:29:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to work on it anymore
[08/13/2007 12:29:57 AM] Robert Douglas: Merlin says: 
so most likely itis just that the email shit has been limited
[08/13/2007 12:30:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to be done with this project
[08/13/2007 12:30:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i'm not going to feel any different about it tomorrow
[08/13/2007 12:30:32 AM] Robert Douglas: once it is working, we wont have to do shit to it again
[08/13/2007 12:30:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: how about tell the client to cancel their yahoo account and use a real webhosting company
[08/13/2007 12:30:58 AM] Robert Douglas: they already paid for yahoo
[08/13/2007 12:31:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: for how long?
[08/13/2007 12:31:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: a month?
[08/13/2007 12:31:07 AM] Robert Douglas: year
[08/13/2007 12:31:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: why in the hell would they ever do such a thing?
[08/13/2007 12:31:28 AM] Robert Douglas: is it ok if i delete the dbadmin/Iterator.php ?
[08/13/2007 12:31:33 AM] Robert Douglas: that way we dont have 2 version
[08/13/2007 12:31:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: leave that one for now
[08/13/2007 12:31:37 AM] Robert Douglas: s
[08/13/2007 12:31:50 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, then i'll delete the new one
[08/13/2007 12:31:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: we have 2 versions of Details.php too because yahoo's includes are fucking retarded
[08/13/2007 12:32:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: don't delete the new one either
[08/13/2007 12:32:09 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/13/2007 12:32:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats the one we need to get working
[08/13/2007 12:32:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i will have to suck it up and call yahoo and ask them how to turn on error reporting
[08/13/2007 12:33:06 AM] Robert Douglas: alright
[08/13/2007 12:33:11 AM] Robert Douglas: well let's look into it tomorrow
[08/13/2007 12:33:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to do this anymore
[08/13/2007 12:33:36 AM] Robert Douglas: i hate it too
[08/13/2007 12:33:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is the most annoying project i have ever worked on
[08/13/2007 12:33:42 AM] Robert Douglas: likewise

[08/13/2007 10:41:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: we done?
[08/13/2007 10:41:25 AM] Robert Douglas: it said quota was full?
[08/13/2007 10:41:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/13/2007 10:41:34 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/13/2007 10:41:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just ran it again and got the e-mails
[08/13/2007 10:41:43 AM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[08/13/2007 10:41:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i changed the hardcoded address to mine
[08/13/2007 10:41:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it all works
[08/13/2007 10:42:00 AM] Robert Douglas: and the emails that arrived looked goood?
[08/13/2007 10:42:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: soo it looks like we can't send out 200 e-mails per day
[08/13/2007 10:42:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes they look good
[08/13/2007 10:42:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: g2g take a shower
[08/13/2007 10:42:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: bbl
[08/13/2007 10:43:06 AM] Robert Douglas: so when the iterator runs every day, the renewal email will only be sent out once
[08/13/2007 10:43:07 AM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[08/13/2007 10:43:27 AM] Robert Douglas: can u setup the outgoing emails to BCC me?
[08/13/2007 10:43:41 AM] Robert Douglas: so the people who receive them don't know that i am receiving a copy?
[08/13/2007 10:43:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes it only is sent once
[08/13/2007 10:44:16 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/13/2007 10:45:06 AM] Robert Douglas: let me know when u have the BCC set
[08/13/2007 10:45:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: done
[08/13/2007 10:46:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: should i active the other e-mail addresses?
[08/13/2007 10:46:19 AM] Robert Douglas: what u mean?
[08/13/2007 10:46:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: should make it so it sends the e-mails to the real users not just you
[08/13/2007 10:46:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/13/2007 10:46:57 AM] Robert Douglas: correct
[08/13/2007 10:47:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not yet, we still need to find out if that other script works
[08/13/2007 10:47:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you upload it to the server?
[08/13/2007 10:47:18 AM] Robert Douglas: good point
[08/13/2007 10:47:20 AM] Robert Douglas: yes it is up
[08/13/2007 10:47:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: the one i sent you
[08/13/2007 10:47:25 AM] Robert Douglas: and it is supposed to run at 10am
[08/13/2007 10:47:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: where is it located?
[08/13/2007 10:48:10 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/clients/azrn/cron.php)http://www.rp-s.com/clients/azrn/cron.php
[08/13/2007 10:49:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you just open it to copy the link?
[08/13/2007 10:49:25 AM] Robert Douglas: i just ran it
[08/13/2007 10:49:27 AM] Robert Douglas: to verify it worked
[08/13/2007 10:49:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: me too
[08/13/2007 10:49:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: which means it worked because i recieved 92 e-mails, 2x46
[08/13/2007 10:49:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: now i will upload you in the BCC and make it live
[08/13/2007 10:50:06 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/13/2007 10:50:10 AM] Robert Douglas: so u set yourself to be in BCC
[08/13/2007 10:50:13 AM] Robert Douglas: and TO addy
[08/13/2007 10:50:14 AM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[08/13/2007 10:50:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: which means as soon as i run it, it changed the status in the database
[08/13/2007 10:50:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to get all these e-mails
[08/13/2007 10:50:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see why you want them either
[08/13/2007 10:50:57 AM] Robert Douglas: to make sure everything is working
[08/13/2007 10:51:04 AM] Robert Douglas: we have no logging at all
[08/13/2007 10:51:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we just verified that it works
[08/13/2007 10:51:36 AM] Robert Douglas: yes, but we did that a couplke times and it wasnt working then
[08/13/2007 10:51:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: because of the quota
[08/13/2007 10:51:51 AM] Robert Douglas: it is better to over verify and come out ahead, than under verify and have an issue

[08/13/2007 10:52:26 AM] Robert Douglas: should be green
[08/13/2007 10:52:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: k wasn't sure
[08/13/2007 10:52:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll change it
[08/13/2007 10:52:38 AM] Robert Douglas: np
[08/13/2007 10:52:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: want to run the script?
[08/13/2007 10:52:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: or should i
[08/13/2007 10:52:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/13/2007 10:52:48 AM] Robert Douglas: not yet
[08/13/2007 10:52:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: run it from our server
[08/13/2007 10:52:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: when you do
[08/13/2007 10:52:56 AM] Robert Douglas: right, i'll have the cron run
[08/13/2007 10:53:11 AM] Robert Douglas: just to confirm, nobody will receive an email right now when the script is ran, correct?
[08/13/2007 10:53:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: neg
[08/13/2007 10:53:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: i made it live like you told me
[08/13/2007 10:53:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: everyone will receive their e-mails
[08/13/2007 10:53:49 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, so they wil receive the email
[08/13/2007 10:53:52 AM] Robert Douglas: then tomorrow when it runs
[08/13/2007 10:53:54 AM] Robert Douglas: they will not receive it
[08/13/2007 10:53:55 AM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[08/13/2007 10:53:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/13/2007 10:54:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: because their status will be changed to "e-mail already sent"
[08/13/2007 10:54:11 AM] Robert Douglas: so the renewal email goes out right now, then sets their status to have received the email
[08/13/2007 10:54:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: after that in 17 days they will receive and expired e-mail
[08/13/2007 10:54:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: yup
[08/13/2007 10:54:50 AM] Robert Douglas: ok, and when they receive the expired email
[08/13/2007 10:55:08 AM] Robert Douglas: they will be set to expired
[08/13/2007 10:55:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/13/2007 10:55:15 AM] Robert Douglas: also, expired members are not auto deleted
[08/13/2007 10:55:16 AM] Robert Douglas: correct?
[08/13/2007 10:55:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i took off the deletion
[08/13/2007 10:55:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: correct
[08/13/2007 10:56:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: now i'mma go take a shower

[08/13/2007 10:57:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: manual?
[08/13/2007 10:57:51 AM] Robert Douglas: yes, for the azrn site
[08/13/2007 10:57:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: bleh
[08/13/2007 10:58:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: make sure to mention possible ID-10T errors
[08/13/2007 11:03:07 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/13/2007 11:03:20 AM] Robert Douglas: the only thing we assume, is that the first and last name wont change
[08/13/2007 11:17:28 AM] Robert Douglas: it should run at 11:30am
[08/13/2007 11:20:54 AM] Robert Douglas: u set it up under BCC no CC correct?
[08/13/2007 11:22:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: bcc
[08/13/2007 11:22:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: correct
[08/13/2007 11:24:22 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to do some modifications to text

[08/13/2007 11:24:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: fuck that poster is so fucking hot
[08/13/2007 11:24:41 AM] Robert Douglas: to make it more user friendly
[08/13/2007 11:24:48 AM] Robert Douglas: what poster
[08/13/2007 11:24:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to find me a girl like that, but just a little less lesbian
[08/13/2007 11:24:54 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/13/2007 11:24:56 AM] Robert Douglas: nvm then
[08/13/2007 11:24:58 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm at work
[08/13/2007 11:25:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 11:25:08 AM] Robert Douglas: haha
[08/13/2007 11:25:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i won't send you links to my collections then
[08/13/2007 11:25:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need another 500GB drive to fill up with another website
[08/13/2007 11:25:55 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe rps will buy u one because of all the crap with azrn
[08/13/2007 11:26:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah not sure what i need more space for pr0n of money for food
[08/13/2007 11:26:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: 99 dollar maxtors
[08/13/2007 11:26:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: 500GB maxtors
[08/13/2007 11:26:45 AM] Robert Douglas: maxtors suck
[08/13/2007 11:26:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: nah
[08/13/2007 11:26:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: not that bad
[08/13/2007 11:27:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: better then WD
[08/13/2007 11:27:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the 20 cents/per gig is skeetastic
[08/13/2007 11:28:03 AM] Robert Douglas: it's for an extra $20, u can get seagate 7200.10
[08/13/2007 11:28:23 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.clubit.com/product_detail.cfm?itemno=A3476919&cmp=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r)http://www.clubit.com/product_detail.cfm?itemno=A3476919&cmp=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r
[08/13/2007 11:29:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but i want the NS series
[08/13/2007 11:29:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: AS sucks nuts
[08/13/2007 11:29:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.peerlessmounts.com/dyn/Products/BrowseProduct.aspx/productId/149212/categoryID/195/u/T)http://www.peerlessmounts.com/dyn/Products/BrowseProduct.aspx/productId/149212/categoryID/195/u/T
[08/13/2007 11:29:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i bought one of those
[08/13/2007 11:29:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't get here until thursday
[08/13/2007 11:29:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: its so hot
[08/13/2007 11:29:57 AM] Robert Douglas: AS is fine
[08/13/2007 11:30:00 AM] Robert Douglas: what's the difference?
[08/13/2007 11:30:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: NL35
[08/13/2007 11:30:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: their nearline industrial drives
[08/13/2007 11:31:04 AM] Robert Douglas: what's the difference tho
[08/13/2007 11:31:13 AM] Robert Douglas: those mounts are awesome
[08/13/2007 11:31:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: life
[08/13/2007 11:31:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: look at the technical data and see all the rotation capabilities
[08/13/2007 11:31:37 AM] Robert Douglas: the AS series has a great MFR
[08/13/2007 11:31:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.peerlessmounts.com/pcattachments/TD%20SHEET-090-9570-1-1.PDF)http://www.peerlessmounts.com/pcattachments/TD%20SHEET-090-9570-1-1.PDF
[08/13/2007 11:31:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: neg
[08/13/2007 11:31:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: i bought 3 AS, the same one you are talking about already
[08/13/2007 11:32:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: bought 3 of them, 2 of the 3 died with IO errors after the first month
[08/13/2007 11:32:43 AM] Robert Douglas: that's just bad luck
[08/13/2007 11:32:49 AM] Robert Douglas: you could buy 10 and have all 10 die
[08/13/2007 11:32:53 AM] Robert Douglas: and still they would be great drives
[08/13/2007 11:33:06 AM] Robert Douglas: could be a single source had a huge lot of bad drives
[08/13/2007 11:33:10 AM] Robert Douglas: could just be bad lick
[08/13/2007 11:33:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah maybe, nevertheless it pissed me off, not i want NL35 drives
[08/13/2007 11:34:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: has to be sata II
[08/13/2007 11:34:26 AM] Robert Douglas: sata 2 is meaningless
[08/13/2007 11:34:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[08/13/2007 11:34:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: its faster
[08/13/2007 11:34:56 AM] Robert Douglas: no it isn't, it just has the ability to do greater amout of transfer, but nothing else can utilize that right now
[08/13/2007 11:35:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can
[08/13/2007 11:35:12 AM] Robert Douglas: what MB are u running
[08/13/2007 11:35:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: my motherboard is sata II
[08/13/2007 11:35:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: asus a8n
[08/13/2007 11:35:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: or wait
[08/13/2007 11:35:27 AM] Robert Douglas: it just "supports" it
[08/13/2007 11:35:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: in my server now is a biostar
[08/13/2007 11:35:43 AM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt actually transfer at that rate
[08/13/2007 11:35:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: it supports faster data transfer
[08/13/2007 11:36:08 AM] Robert Douglas: but it isnt ever used
[08/13/2007 11:36:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: sata 1 doesn't actually transfer at 1.5 GB/sec
[08/13/2007 11:36:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: and transfering between hard drives it does use that speed
[08/13/2007 11:36:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you have to cut it in half
[08/13/2007 11:36:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: for read and write
[08/13/2007 11:37:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: then there is a 9 second latency you have to take into account
[08/13/2007 11:37:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: or .9 sec
[08/13/2007 11:37:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e it is now
[08/13/2007 11:38:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: 4.16 ms is what seagate is down to now
[08/13/2007 11:38:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: my mistake
[08/13/2007 11:39:15 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx?ArticleId=16014&PageId=4)http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Reviews/Specific.aspx?ArticleId=16014&PageId=4
[08/13/2007 11:39:28 AM] Robert Douglas: this page says the 3gb/s one was actually slightly faster
[08/13/2007 11:39:33 AM] Robert Douglas: so maybe it has changed now
[08/13/2007 11:40:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: slightly
[08/13/2007 11:40:18 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/169596-28-sata-sata)http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/169596-28-sata-sata
[08/13/2007 11:40:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e all my components are sata II so i am sticking with it
[08/13/2007 11:40:28 AM] Robert Douglas: there's the tech specs that backup what i was saying about seeing no difference
[08/13/2007 11:40:36 AM] Robert Douglas: "No difference whatsoever... well, maybe a couple points in burst speed, but nothing you could notice except in a benchmark.  No hard drive can get close to 150mbps that SATA'1' has, so SATA2's 300 is all marketing hype. "
[08/13/2007 11:41:43 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.clubit.com/product_detail.cfm?itemno=A3494869&cmp=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r)http://www.clubit.com/product_detail.cfm?itemno=A3494869&cmp=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r
[08/13/2007 11:41:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i notice a difference, when i was copying music and DVDs back and forth between sata I drives it used to take at least 1/3 of the time longer then it does not
[08/13/2007 11:41:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: *now
[08/13/2007 11:41:48 AM] Robert Douglas: there is a good WD that is SATA 2
[08/13/2007 11:42:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: maxtor is better then WD
[08/13/2007 11:42:18 AM] Robert Douglas: no it isnt
[08/13/2007 11:42:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know WD got bought by seagate
[08/13/2007 11:42:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: because they sux
[08/13/2007 11:42:42 AM] Robert Douglas: go to any hardware forum, and they will say WD and Seagate are above Maxtor
[08/13/2007 11:42:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have had good luck with maxtor
[08/13/2007 11:43:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: my first 200GB drive was a maxtor
[08/13/2007 11:43:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: and its still running strong
[08/13/2007 11:43:27 AM] Robert Douglas: and u make up .00000000001% of their customer base
[08/13/2007 11:43:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 11:43:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: it all adds up
[08/13/2007 11:44:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: at least i am not going after hitachi deathstars
[08/13/2007 11:44:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 11:44:56 AM] Robert Douglas: sweet, the e-mails were sent out to me!!
[08/13/2007 11:45:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: yay
[08/13/2007 11:45:05 AM] Robert Douglas: lol, i'll agree with comment about hitachi
[08/13/2007 11:46:05 AM] Robert Douglas: omg,t he last 2 emails were fucked up

[08/13/2007 11:46:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats impossible
[08/13/2007 11:46:43 AM] Robert Douglas: i'm just gunna ignore it
[08/13/2007 11:46:47 AM] Robert Douglas: and hope it doesnt happen again
[08/13/2007 11:47:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: xml code for it?

[08/13/2007 11:47:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: completely blank?

[08/13/2007 11:50:09 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/ Renewal Pending Members: 53
[08/13/2007 11:50:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes it filters out the ones without e-mail addressess
[08/13/2007 11:50:51 AM] Robert Douglas: ok good lol
[08/13/2007 11:51:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: but it still updates their status
[08/13/2007 11:51:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: so they will expire
[08/13/2007 11:51:10 AM] Robert Douglas: very nice
[08/13/2007 11:51:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: eventually
[08/13/2007 11:51:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: i sent my dad a shopping cart with 1000 dollars worth of drives
[08/13/2007 11:52:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: he send me an e-mail back with, i assumed you only meant to get a few
[08/13/2007 11:52:34 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/13/2007 11:52:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe i'll just order 1 drive every month until my birthday, then ask him for 2x750s
[08/13/2007 11:52:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: it will slip under the radar
[08/13/2007 11:52:58 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/13/2007 11:53:09 AM] Robert Douglas: that's a lot of $$ in hard drives
[08/13/2007 11:53:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i order computer parts on his card and then tell him i'll put money back on it
[08/13/2007 11:53:18 AM] Robert Douglas: u cant have more hard drives than me
[08/13/2007 11:53:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude i am shooting for a 10TB system by the end of this school year
[08/13/2007 11:53:35 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/13/2007 11:53:36 AM] Robert Douglas: dammit
[08/13/2007 11:53:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: so good fucking luck keeping up with me
[08/13/2007 11:53:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[08/13/2007 11:53:43 AM] Robert Douglas: do u even have enough hard drive bays
[08/13/2007 11:53:53 AM] Robert Douglas: i have support for 12 drives
[08/13/2007 11:53:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: my case fits 12
[08/13/2007 11:53:56 AM] Robert Douglas: dammit
[08/13/2007 11:53:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/13/2007 11:53:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 11:54:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: and my operating system take up less space!
[08/13/2007 11:54:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-P

[08/13/2007 11:55:24 AM] Robert Douglas: i dunno
[08/13/2007 11:55:31 AM] Robert Douglas: intel conroes are super quick
[08/13/2007 11:56:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e AMDs use less power and are more stable
[08/13/2007 11:56:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: more stable then a table
[08/13/2007 11:56:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: i bent pins which eventually broke off, and it still runs like a dream

[08/13/2007 11:58:44 AM] Robert Douglas: conroe has less power consumption than AMD
[08/13/2007 11:58:55 AM] Robert Douglas: benchmarks prove it
[08/13/2007 11:59:05 AM] Robert Douglas: conroe is better than anything amd offers, for anything over $150
[08/13/2007 11:59:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e i am staying loyal to AMD and ATI
[08/13/2007 11:59:31 AM] Robert Douglas: np

[08/13/2007 11:59:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: the market goes back and forth so much anyways, they've just hit a slum
[08/13/2007 12:00:01 PM] Robert Douglas: until then tho, conroes will lead
[08/13/2007 12:00:09 PM] Robert Douglas: conroe is new technology
[08/13/2007 12:00:13 PM] Robert Douglas: amd is older
[08/13/2007 12:00:28 PM] Robert Douglas: once amd releases their new cpus, i'm sure amd will be better
[08/13/2007 12:00:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but until then, conroe SPANKS amd

[08/13/2007 04:21:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it won't work over the network in inet mode
[08/13/2007 04:22:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we need to tell the admins to remove the two svn entries
[08/13/2007 04:23:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have no idea how we can get it to autostart when the server is restarted

[08/14/2007 11:03:29 AM] Robert Douglas: my single UPS cant handle it all
[08/14/2007 11:03:36 AM] Robert Douglas: it gets overloaded when my tv and comptuer are running
[08/14/2007 11:03:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: same, it beeps at me when i start up my computers because the battery can't support it

[08/14/2007 11:05:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: but is the coax at least?
[08/14/2007 11:05:17 AM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/14/2007 11:05:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: bummer
[08/14/2007 11:05:26 AM] Robert Douglas: the power is what concerns me
[08/14/2007 11:05:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: you could get a jolt of electricity through a coax cable and blow out your tuner
[08/14/2007 11:06:17 AM] Robert Douglas: it would blow up the receiver
[08/14/2007 11:06:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would suck too
[08/14/2007 11:06:59 AM] Robert Douglas: tyhe receive is comcast's receive

[08/14/2007 01:45:24 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php)http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php
[08/14/2007 01:45:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah you need to revert the index.php back
[08/14/2007 01:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fucked it up
[08/14/2007 01:45:43 PM] Robert Douglas: u mean u didnt save a backup
[08/14/2007 01:45:44 PM] Robert Douglas: ?
[08/14/2007 01:45:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: stupid ass fireftp program
[08/14/2007 01:46:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking damnit
[08/14/2007 01:46:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate this fucking program
[08/14/2007 01:46:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: do we have any backups?
[08/14/2007 01:46:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/portal/index.php)http://www.rp-s.com/myrps/portal/index.php
[08/14/2007 01:46:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: trying to fix that damn page
[08/14/2007 01:47:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and this stupid ass ftp program uploads shit to the wrong place
[08/14/2007 01:47:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: god damnit
[08/14/2007 01:48:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: backups?
[08/14/2007 01:48:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: need to revert back config.php and index.php because i uploaded the portal stuff to the wrong directory
[08/14/2007 01:50:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: see this is why i didn;t want to install this fucking shit because i knew i would fuck something up
[08/14/2007 01:51:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need the directory above myrps
[08/14/2007 01:51:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i said in my email install portal NEXT TO myrps, not underneath it
[08/14/2007 01:51:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am getting more stupid ass errors
[08/14/2007 01:51:51 PM] Robert Douglas: let me confirm with alex that no changes have been made to sugar
[08/14/2007 01:51:59 PM] Robert Douglas: and then i will see if we can restore it from a full backup
[08/14/2007 01:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: when?
[08/14/2007 01:52:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: we just need to backup those 2 pages
[08/14/2007 01:52:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i msg'd alex right now, restore should only take a couple minutes
[08/14/2007 01:52:23 PM] Robert Douglas: are you sure there are only the 2 affected pages?
[08/14/2007 01:52:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/14/2007 01:52:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure
[08/14/2007 01:52:49 PM] Robert Douglas: can you tell me the full path to the two files that need to be restore?
[08/14/2007 01:52:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/14/2007 01:53:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: /home/rps/public_html/myrps/index.php
 /home/rps/public_html/myrps/config.php
[08/14/2007 01:53:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you won't have to undo any changes
[08/14/2007 01:54:18 PM] Robert Douglas: in the future, whenever you are doing developement or changes etc, will you make your own backups before there is a chance for anything to get messed up?
[08/14/2007 01:54:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2007 01:54:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i didn't mean to change those files at all
[08/14/2007 01:54:39 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[08/14/2007 01:54:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: this stupid fucking ftp program blows balls
[08/14/2007 01:55:06 PM] Robert Douglas: it's cool, mistakes happen
[08/14/2007 01:55:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can do just those 2 files?
[08/14/2007 01:57:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is errors all over this thing
[08/14/2007 01:57:13 PM] Robert Douglas: yes i will
[08/14/2007 01:57:22 PM] Robert Douglas: what is the other dir you need to access?
[08/14/2007 01:57:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: just public_html not myrps
[08/14/2007 01:57:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: move the ftp default directory up one
[08/14/2007 01:58:05 PM] Robert Douglas: u only need access to 1 dir tho inside, right?
[08/14/2007 01:58:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to put the portal next to myrps
[08/14/2007 01:58:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: not inside it
[08/14/2007 01:58:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but yes just access to 1
[08/14/2007 01:58:41 PM] Robert Douglas: why not inside it
[08/14/2007 01:58:50 PM] Robert Douglas: what's the point of the portal
[08/14/2007 01:58:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: because the tutorial says so
[08/14/2007 01:59:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: to make my life hell is the point
[08/14/2007 01:59:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am starting over
[08/14/2007 01:59:58 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/14/2007 02:00:00 PM] Robert Douglas: what's the point
[08/14/2007 02:00:08 PM] Robert Douglas: explain the portal and why you are doing this
[08/14/2007 02:00:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: its the helpdesk program alex wants me to install it
[08/14/2007 02:00:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: sugar works again
[08/14/2007 02:01:06 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, took 5 mins to get admins to restore the 2 files
[08/14/2007 02:01:09 PM] Robert Douglas: not bad huh?
[08/14/2007 02:01:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty good
[08/14/2007 02:01:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i still need ftp to public_html not myrps directory
[08/14/2007 02:01:37 PM] Robert Douglas: you need access to the dir the portal is going to be installed to
[08/14/2007 02:01:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: 1. Obtain the SugarPortal-4.5.1b.zip file from SugarCRM, save it to your Web 
 server, and extract the files to a separate folder.
[08/14/2007 02:01:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i want u creating directories without letting me know what is going to be inside of the dir
[08/14/2007 02:02:06 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want u*
[08/14/2007 02:02:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to upload portal to public_html/portal
[08/14/2007 02:02:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: not public_html/myrps/portal
[08/14/2007 02:02:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: 1. Obtain the SugarPortal-4.5.1b.zip file from SugarCRM, save it to your Web 
 server, and extract the files to a separate folder.
[08/14/2007 02:02:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: because that said so
[08/14/2007 02:02:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: 2. On your Web browser, enter the location of the install.php file on your Web 
 server. For example: localhost/SugarPortal/install.php
[08/14/2007 02:02:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that
[08/14/2007 02:02:45 PM] Robert Douglas: that doesnt mean you cant install it above myrps though
[08/14/2007 02:02:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: SugarPortal is outside sugar crm
[08/14/2007 02:03:01 PM] Robert Douglas: only in that example
[08/14/2007 02:03:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there are errors
[08/14/2007 02:03:10 PM] Robert Douglas: the portal can be isntalled within the myrps dir
[08/14/2007 02:03:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: stupid errors
[08/14/2007 02:03:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: which might have something to do with it
[08/14/2007 02:03:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont like the fact we are going to have a dir named portal
[08/14/2007 02:03:59 PM] Robert Douglas: rp-s.com/portal
[08/14/2007 02:04:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok 
[08/14/2007 02:04:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i will reinstall it underneath myrps
[08/14/2007 02:04:23 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/14/2007 02:04:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but at least sugar works again
[08/14/2007 02:04:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i also think u are wasting ur time with the customer portal, and that there are other things 4 u to do
[08/14/2007 02:04:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll try not to fuck it up again
[08/14/2007 02:04:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: other things?
[08/14/2007 02:04:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: like what?
[08/14/2007 02:04:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think the customer portal is something we're going to use at all
[08/14/2007 02:05:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: alex said install it so we can install the sugar KB
[08/14/2007 02:05:27 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we're not going to use a sugar KB, that's 100%
[08/14/2007 02:05:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: he said we are not using cerberus anymore so we should install sugar portal and sugar KB and see if they will meet our needs
[08/14/2007 02:06:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you disagree talk to alex
[08/14/2007 02:06:05 PM] Robert Douglas: yes i will
[08/14/2007 02:06:09 PM] Robert Douglas: please hold off on all dev
[08/14/2007 02:06:15 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll msg u back in a min or two
[08/14/2007 02:06:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you think there is something better for me to do, i am all ears
[08/14/2007 02:08:23 PM] Robert Douglas: apparently alex just wants to see a demo of it
[08/14/2007 02:08:31 PM] Robert Douglas: and since he couldnt find a demo, he's asking you to install it
[08/14/2007 02:08:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: its completely seperate from sugar
[08/14/2007 02:08:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: its just an interface to some of the api
[08/14/2007 02:08:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it can be placed anywhere
[08/14/2007 02:09:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we need the portal to use the KB according to him
[08/14/2007 02:10:05 PM] Robert Douglas: he wanted to see the KB as a demo, and because of that, it requires the portal
[08/14/2007 02:10:11 PM] Robert Douglas: he just wants to see how the KB works
[08/14/2007 02:10:20 PM] Robert Douglas: even though we're not going to use it for our RPS KB
[08/14/2007 02:10:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree, the KB might be a good solution
[08/14/2007 02:10:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: why not?
[08/14/2007 02:10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: sugar isnt always stable
[08/14/2007 02:10:59 PM] Robert Douglas: we're going to use a KB that doesn't require another program
[08/14/2007 02:12:26 PM] Robert Douglas: alex is just curious about what it looks like
[08/14/2007 02:12:31 PM] Robert Douglas: he couldnt find a demo
[08/14/2007 02:15:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yay it works this time
[08/14/2007 02:18:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks cool
[08/14/2007 02:18:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should use it
[08/14/2007 02:18:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: or buy that other KB
[08/14/2007 02:19:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/demo/)http://www.knowledgebase-script.com/demo/
[08/14/2007 02:19:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: skeet skeet
[08/14/2007 02:19:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/14/2007 02:19:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i think that one is pretty advanced
[08/14/2007 02:20:00 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont need something all that great
[08/14/2007 02:20:02 PM] Robert Douglas: just something simple
[08/14/2007 02:21:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: if pmxp wasn't so shitty and supports multi users it wouldn't have to close the DB every 5 fucking minutes
[08/14/2007 02:22:11 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/14/2007 02:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should write our own
[08/14/2007 02:22:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: the algorithms for password generation and AES are already written
[08/14/2007 02:22:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to be a security specialist to write an interface
[08/14/2007 02:22:58 PM] Robert Douglas: i think we have bigger issues to focus on
[08/14/2007 02:23:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats all i want to do
[08/14/2007 02:23:26 PM] Robert Douglas: for pmxp, all we need 2 do is close the db when we are done using it
[08/14/2007 02:23:29 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be fine for now if we do that
[08/14/2007 02:24:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: no because netdrive still keeps a cache of the DB files
[08/14/2007 02:24:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we end up overwritting eachothers stuff
[08/14/2007 02:24:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: because of a stupid cache and not being redownloaded every time
[08/14/2007 02:24:37 PM] Robert Douglas: flush files clears that up
[08/14/2007 02:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we have to flush files every time we make a change?
[08/14/2007 02:25:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats gay
[08/14/2007 02:25:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should be enter user, enter password and save
[08/14/2007 02:25:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: done
[08/14/2007 02:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i made a new interface for a password management system, it would be fucking sexy
[08/14/2007 02:26:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: like sugar style

[08/14/2007 03:42:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2007 03:43:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: tar xzvf
[08/14/2007 03:43:07 PM] Brian Cullinan:  filename after that
[08/14/2007 03:44:29 PM] Robert Douglas: thanks, i'm a retard
[08/14/2007 03:44:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[08/14/2007 03:45:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had to look it up
[08/14/2007 03:45:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can never remember that command
[08/14/2007 04:04:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is up with jambonie?
[08/14/2007 04:04:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: we ever going to fix up the search results display?
[08/14/2007 04:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember i made it a lot more robust
[08/14/2007 04:05:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the media list at the bottom of a band profile uses the search engine
[08/14/2007 04:05:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still have to fix up the user search and make a search page but you told me to hold off

[08/14/2007 05:23:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but anyways, i worked on portal more, came accross problems with contacts using the portal, waiting to hear back from sugar support in forum
[08/14/2007 05:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: [08/14/2007 04:04:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is up with jambonie?
 [08/14/2007 04:04:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: we ever going to fix up the search results display?
 [08/14/2007 04:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember i made it a lot more robust
 [08/14/2007 04:05:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the media list at the bottom of a band profile uses the search engine
 [08/14/2007 04:05:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still have to fix up the user search and make a search page but you told me to hold off
 
[08/14/2007 05:23:29 PM] Robert Douglas: okcool
[08/14/2007 05:23:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: just wondering whats going on with jambonie
[08/14/2007 05:23:46 PM] Robert Douglas: we r not gunna mess with search page
[08/14/2007 05:23:55 PM] Robert Douglas: but we need to do the shopping cart and classifiedes section
[08/14/2007 05:24:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to mess with search results
[08/14/2007 05:24:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: like formatting the media output on the band profile page to look nicer
[08/14/2007 05:25:03 PM] Robert Douglas: creating the functionality of the shopping cart and classifieds is more important
[08/14/2007 05:25:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i need to admin to disable the svn xinet stuff so we can run it as a deamon
[08/14/2007 05:25:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so how do you want to do this shopping cart?
[08/14/2007 05:25:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll have a write up with more specs for u
[08/14/2007 05:26:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: have a table for product information, and store the quantity and item number in an array in the session?
[08/14/2007 05:26:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think thats how others do it
[08/14/2007 05:26:26 PM] Robert Douglas: this is going to be much more different than a norm cart
[08/14/2007 05:26:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll explain it later when i get time to write it up
[08/14/2007 05:26:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: then use the paypal method i wrote up for azrn but more stable
[08/14/2007 05:26:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/14/2007 05:26:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i need to admin to disable the svn xinet stuff so we can run it as a deamon
[08/14/2007 05:27:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: or just give me admin privledges

[08/15/2007 08:53:38 PM] Robert Douglas: y0
[08/15/2007 08:54:17 PM] Robert Douglas: my idea that caused this error
[08/15/2007 08:54:20 PM] Robert Douglas: is that the client paid for the invoice
[08/15/2007 08:54:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but didnt click the return to merchant link
[08/15/2007 08:55:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: that must have been it, in which case the iterator would have caught it
[08/15/2007 08:55:53 PM] Robert Douglas: right
[08/15/2007 08:56:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so the issue might be that we need to have iterator run more often
[08/15/2007 08:56:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i am not sure that was it
[08/15/2007 08:56:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: here is what is really strange
[08/15/2007 08:56:33 PM] Robert Douglas: well if u ran the iterator and it corrected it
[08/15/2007 08:56:36 PM] Robert Douglas: then that was the issue
[08/15/2007 08:56:45 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why i asked to make sure the iterator was ran
[08/15/2007 08:56:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me explain
[08/15/2007 08:56:47 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[08/15/2007 08:56:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator i don't think corrected it
[08/15/2007 08:56:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: the weirdest thing...
[08/15/2007 08:58:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i looked at the table and under transactions the new one she made was listed, but the sendmail was still set to 1, and the InvNum was blank, but the thing is, the transaction string is appended in the SAME IF Statement as the "UPDATE member" to increment the year
[08/15/2007 08:58:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: now that would tell me there was a database issue
[08/15/2007 08:59:06 PM] Robert Douglas: what does "sendmail was still set to 1" mean
[08/15/2007 08:59:14 PM] Robert Douglas: and a blank InvNum?
[08/15/2007 08:59:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i just confirmed that it is using the same code for the WHERE statement, so its not a lookup problem
[08/15/2007 08:59:52 PM] Robert Douglas: one question, did you run the iterator first, and see if the issue was fixed?
[08/15/2007 09:00:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: sendmail gets set FROM 0 TO 1 when the renew email is sent
[08/15/2007 09:00:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats all i mean by it
[08/15/2007 09:00:40 PM] Robert Douglas: here's something else for ya
[08/15/2007 09:00:47 PM] Robert Douglas: Lynn Connel received a renew email
[08/15/2007 09:00:52 PM] Robert Douglas: Dear Lynn Connell, 
 
Renew your membership: 
(Link: http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Renew.php?Firstname=Lynn&Lastname=Connell)http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Renew.php?Firstname=Lynn&Lastname=Connell
[08/15/2007 09:01:05 PM] Robert Douglas: so as soon as she signed up, she received a renew email
[08/15/2007 09:01:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i didn't run the iterator, i looked up the transaction on their paypal account and compared it to what was in the database, then i cleared the transaction and ran the iterator and it worked, because it checks to see if the transaction ID is already in the database, if it is then it doesn't increment it because its already been incremented for that transaction
[08/15/2007 09:02:13 PM] Robert Douglas: so if u ran the iterator first, it wouldn't have helped
[08/15/2007 09:02:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok that last thing you mentioned can be fixed easily
[08/15/2007 09:03:08 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/15/2007 09:03:22 PM] Robert Douglas: if i didnt have u set the CC email to me too, i wouldnt have known she received a renew email right away
[08/15/2007 09:03:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg
[08/15/2007 09:03:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait
[08/15/2007 09:03:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: hold on
[08/15/2007 09:03:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: that makes it all clear
[08/15/2007 09:04:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator set the sendmail to 1 which just means the renewal email has been sent
[08/15/2007 09:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that still doesn't explain why it didn't increment
[08/15/2007 09:05:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me make a correction to the iterator, and we will just have to wait until the next problem
[08/15/2007 09:06:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think this will fix it
[08/15/2007 09:06:20 PM] Robert Douglas: let me know when u r done and i will test it with real info
[08/15/2007 09:06:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of weird how if we test it, there are no problems, but when someone else uses it there are problems
[08/15/2007 09:06:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: one more thing, was this a member that previously expired in 2006?
[08/15/2007 09:06:47 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure
[08/15/2007 09:06:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it was
[08/15/2007 09:06:58 PM] Robert Douglas: let me check
[08/15/2007 09:07:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: because all the other members around her expired in 2006
[08/15/2007 09:07:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like her number is 441 or something
[08/15/2007 09:07:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: everyone else with that low of number expired in 2006
[08/15/2007 09:07:39 PM] Robert Douglas: INSERT INTO `members` VALUES (106, 441, 'Connell', 'Lynn', '15250 South 29th St.', 'Phoenix', 'AZ', '85048', '480-759-9671', '', '', 'qheeler@aol.com', 'Banner Desert', 'RN', '2006-08-31 00:00:00', '', 0, '');
[08/15/2007 09:07:50 PM] Robert Douglas: so 2006
[08/15/2007 09:07:54 PM] Robert Douglas: that's the issue here
[08/15/2007 09:08:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: which would explain the renewal e-mail and the appearance that it didn't increment her subscription
[08/15/2007 09:08:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i am writing a fix for that too
[08/15/2007 09:08:10 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[08/15/2007 09:08:15 PM] Robert Douglas: so if member expired in 06
[08/15/2007 09:08:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: as i explained in the e-mail
[08/15/2007 09:08:22 PM] Robert Douglas: and they renew in 08
[08/15/2007 09:08:35 PM] Robert Douglas: it changes their xpr to 09
[08/15/2007 09:09:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/15/2007 09:09:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok you can no longer run the iterator inside the dbadmin, i am removing it since we put it outside
[08/15/2007 09:10:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we don't get versions mixed up
[08/15/2007 09:10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good to me
[08/15/2007 09:12:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just realized today that my new laptop has the same resolution as my desktop monitor
[08/15/2007 09:13:39 PM] Robert Douglas: not bad
[08/15/2007 09:16:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok lets play around with my fix and i'll change the DB back to what we believe it was then we will run the iterator
[08/15/2007 09:17:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll tell you every step of the way so you know it works right
[08/15/2007 09:17:06 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, but can u make it so we dont send out emails?
[08/15/2007 09:17:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want to have the client receive another email
[08/15/2007 09:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: if it works, it won't send out the e-mail, i won't run the iterator, the details.php page does all the transaction processing
[08/15/2007 09:17:51 PM] Robert Douglas: also, can u explain the new logic with renewals that are greater than 1 yr old
[08/15/2007 09:17:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: the iterator just uses an include for the transactions
[08/15/2007 09:18:13 PM] Robert Douglas: the iterator sent out the email last time at 11:30am today
[08/15/2007 09:18:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont want another email sent out
[08/15/2007 09:19:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it sent it out because i didn't have an if statement for NeverPaid, and because the Details page didn't increment it properly when it was included, it only incremented it to 2007 from 2006
[08/15/2007 09:19:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: f(substr($current_date, 0, 4) <= 2007)
 
[08/15/2007 09:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the if for changing the date
[08/15/2007 09:19:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if the incremented date is still only equal to 2007 it will fix it and make it the current year plus 1
[08/15/2007 09:20:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: $current_date = (date('Y') + 1) . substr($current_date, 4, strlen($current_date) - 4);
 
[08/15/2007 09:20:24 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont want 2007 hard coded
[08/15/2007 09:20:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not
[08/15/2007 09:20:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[08/15/2007 09:20:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: snap
[08/15/2007 09:20:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: your right
[08/15/2007 09:20:51 PM] Robert Douglas: if current yr > expirdation of member
[08/15/2007 09:20:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if(substr($current_date, 0, 4) <= date('Y'))
 
[08/15/2007 09:20:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: my bad
[08/15/2007 09:21:06 PM] Robert Douglas: then we want to set the expr to current yr + 1
[08/15/2007 09:21:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: same thing yeah
[08/15/2007 09:21:09 PM] Robert Douglas: else add 1
[08/15/2007 09:21:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yep
[08/15/2007 09:21:16 PM] Robert Douglas: cool
[08/15/2007 09:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/View-Modify-Members.php)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/View-Modify-Members.php
[08/15/2007 09:22:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: look at lynn
[08/15/2007 09:23:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: she is under expired members
[08/15/2007 09:23:28 PM] Robert Douglas: did u reload the DB?
[08/15/2007 09:23:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: no just changed it back
[08/15/2007 09:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: sec
[08/15/2007 09:23:40 PM] Robert Douglas: ok good lol
[08/15/2007 09:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: it works!
[08/15/2007 09:27:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: went from 2006 to 2008
[08/15/2007 09:27:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: which means iterator will work because its just an include
[08/15/2007 09:28:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: the other 4 transactions i see in their paypal account are also good active in our database
[08/15/2007 09:29:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so there shouldn't be any more problems
[08/15/2007 09:30:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: which means this is a good time for another beer
[08/15/2007 09:33:30 PM] Robert Douglas: yay
[08/15/2007 09:33:30 PM] Robert Douglas: thex
[08/15/2007 09:34:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am trying to cover the entire kitchen counter with beer bottles
[08/15/2007 09:34:35 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/15/2007 09:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: my roommate suggested it, but he isn't committed to anything, he keeps throwing them away
[08/15/2007 09:35:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i have to pull them out and add them to the counter
[08/15/2007 09:35:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are rinsing them out first so they don't smell
[08/15/2007 09:35:26 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/15/2007 09:35:29 PM] Robert Douglas: very nice
[08/15/2007 09:35:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: its coming along well we have almost 48 bottles on the counter so far
[08/15/2007 10:07:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you there?
[08/15/2007 10:07:39 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[08/15/2007 10:07:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you figured out how to actually close something on the treo?
[08/15/2007 10:08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: click the ok button
[08/15/2007 10:08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: or the x on the toop right
[08/15/2007 10:09:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah then press option+ok
[08/15/2007 10:09:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and see all the shit is still running
[08/15/2007 10:09:43 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont have the same treo
[08/15/2007 10:09:48 PM] Robert Douglas: so everything is handled differently
[08/15/2007 10:11:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: does option+ok not work?
[08/15/2007 10:11:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i just hit Ok
[08/15/2007 10:11:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and it works
[08/15/2007 10:13:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: open the task manager
[08/15/2007 10:13:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and tell me if there is anything in your list
[08/15/2007 10:13:19 PM] Robert Douglas: i c no task manager
[08/15/2007 10:14:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry its under memory management
[08/15/2007 10:14:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: then go over to the running programs tab
[08/15/2007 10:15:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i c activesync
[08/15/2007 10:15:18 PM] Robert Douglas: and the email program
[08/15/2007 10:15:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats it?
[08/15/2007 10:15:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[08/15/2007 10:15:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit
[08/15/2007 10:15:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had like 10 things open on mine
[08/15/2007 10:15:45 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/15/2007 10:15:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking gay that it doesn't clos
[08/15/2007 10:15:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: e
[08/15/2007 10:15:51 PM] Robert Douglas: restart it
[08/15/2007 10:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the treo version doesn't matter
[08/15/2007 10:15:53 PM] Robert Douglas: then check it
[08/15/2007 10:15:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: its all windows mobile
[08/15/2007 10:16:02 PM] Robert Douglas: treos handle things differently
[08/15/2007 10:16:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its all the OS not the hardware
[08/15/2007 10:16:17 PM] Robert Douglas: but the hardware manages the OS
[08/15/2007 10:16:21 PM] Robert Douglas: so u might push one button
[08/15/2007 10:16:24 PM] Robert Douglas: and i have to push another
[08/15/2007 10:16:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are running windows mobile 5?
[08/15/2007 10:16:34 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure the version
[08/15/2007 10:16:40 PM] Robert Douglas: but i have no option button
[08/15/2007 10:17:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: option is the little dark one that lets you use the numbers or ccharacters above the letters
[08/15/2007 10:17:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the left, the one that is not the shift
[08/15/2007 10:17:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you fail
[08/15/2007 10:17:21 PM] Robert Douglas: what happens when u hit ok/
[08/15/2007 10:17:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: hold option and press ok
[08/15/2007 10:17:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it should bring up the task manager
[08/15/2007 10:17:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt say option
[08/15/2007 10:17:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i said hit ok
[08/15/2007 10:17:47 PM] Robert Douglas: for the program that is open
[08/15/2007 10:17:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok closes it
[08/15/2007 10:17:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the process still runs
[08/15/2007 10:18:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i dunno
[08/15/2007 10:18:05 PM] Robert Douglas: call verizon support
[08/15/2007 10:18:15 PM] Robert Douglas: they r snart
[08/15/2007 10:18:17 PM] Robert Douglas: smart
[08/15/2007 10:21:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i figured it out
[08/15/2007 10:21:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know that spb stuff we installed
[08/15/2007 10:21:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: go to buttons in settings -> Buttons
[08/15/2007 10:21:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: and use the list to select the OK button
[08/15/2007 10:21:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: should say <OK/Close> next to it
[08/15/2007 10:22:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: select that with the middle button, and click right to go over to 2. Assign Program
[08/15/2007 10:22:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and select [Close] from sbp, that actually closes the program
[08/15/2007 10:22:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of just hiding it
[08/15/2007 10:23:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: it frees up your faster memory if you actually close it
[08/15/2007 10:23:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: like that e-mail shouldn't even be running right now if it is not actually on the screen
[08/15/2007 10:25:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you never have to do a soft reset
[08/15/2007 10:26:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: the current close button is like the minimize button in regular windows
[08/15/2007 10:26:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.pocketpcmag.com/blogs/index.php?blog=15&cat=124)http://www.pocketpcmag.com/blogs/index.php?blog=15&cat=124
[08/15/2007 10:26:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: this person describes a "magic button" which is freeware for doing the same thing the sbp [Close] button does
[08/15/2007 10:29:01 PM] Robert Douglas: going 2 bed
[08/15/2007 10:29:02 PM] Robert Douglas: gn
[08/15/2007 10:29:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait
[08/15/2007 10:29:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you follow my instructions?
[08/15/2007 10:29:20 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have that prog installed
[08/15/2007 10:29:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[08/15/2007 10:29:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we have a key for it?

[08/16/2007 11:32:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: any more complaints from client?
[08/16/2007 11:32:06 AM] Robert Douglas: not yet
[08/16/2007 11:32:22 AM] Robert Douglas: u have any suggestions for backup software to backup a fileset and db on a linxu box?
[08/16/2007 11:32:25 AM] Robert Douglas: php5, apache2, phpmyadmin
[08/16/2007 11:33:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[08/16/2007 11:33:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: you have to explain purpose better
[08/16/2007 11:33:27 AM] Robert Douglas: i want to backup a folder on a linxu box, and a mysql database
[08/16/2007 11:33:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: when i need to back something up linux i only back up config
[08/16/2007 11:33:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: the DB is the only exception
[08/16/2007 11:34:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: to copy over DB information to another system, you need to do an export of all the databases
[08/16/2007 11:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: you would that you can just copy the entire DB from one place to another, but it doesn't work like that, its encrypted based on the system somehow
[08/16/2007 11:35:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: not sure how it works, but you have to do a whole dumb of the databases and then an import on the new system
[08/16/2007 11:35:30 AM] Robert Douglas: well if we didn't backup the index.php file for myrps, having only the config file wouldnt have helped
[08/16/2007 11:35:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: for backing up php and apache, unless you have php files that you created only back up the /etc/ config files
[08/16/2007 11:35:39 AM] Robert Douglas: i want to specify the folder location
[08/16/2007 11:35:44 AM] Robert Douglas: and the database name
[08/16/2007 11:35:46 AM] Robert Douglas: the script does the rest
[08/16/2007 11:36:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[08/16/2007 11:36:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: whats wrong with myrps?
[08/16/2007 11:36:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: we had that fixed?
[08/16/2007 11:36:31 AM] Robert Douglas: remember when u messed up the index.php file
[08/16/2007 11:36:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: oohhhhh
[08/16/2007 11:36:38 AM] Robert Douglas: if only the config file was backuped it
[08/16/2007 11:36:55 AM] Robert Douglas: my point is, it is better to backup the entire fileset than just the config file
[08/16/2007 11:36:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i said, its php files we put there, those need to be backed up too
[08/16/2007 11:37:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes that falls under files you created so you would need to back up that stuff
[08/16/2007 11:37:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you just said php5 and apache and DB so i was confused
[08/16/2007 11:37:51 AM] Robert Douglas: so you have to enter every file that you change, and have the script manually back it up
[08/16/2007 11:38:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: so what are you trying to accomplish again? i thought the admins did daily backups
[08/16/2007 11:38:41 AM] Robert Douglas: i want to backup a fileset and a mysql database
[08/16/2007 11:38:53 AM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be ran via a cron
[08/16/2007 11:38:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: on the rps server?
[08/16/2007 11:38:57 AM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/16/2007 11:39:01 AM] Robert Douglas: on just a linux box
[08/16/2007 11:39:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[08/16/2007 11:39:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: where are you backing it up to?
[08/16/2007 11:39:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: another partition?
[08/16/2007 11:39:31 AM] Robert Douglas: it can be backed up anywhere
[08/16/2007 11:40:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok i could just run a cp -Rf command thats copy + recursion + force so it doesn't prompt you, and then we will have to figure out the dump command for the database
[08/16/2007 11:40:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i guess you should also delete the previous contents of the backup
[08/16/2007 11:40:56 AM] Robert Douglas: it should tarball a folder and save it with the name of it being the current date
[08/16/2007 11:41:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you would want to run a file that has all 3 command in it in the cron
[08/16/2007 11:41:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats an option too
[08/16/2007 11:41:22 AM] Robert Douglas: isnt that the best thing to do?
[08/16/2007 11:41:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah you can use recursion in tar command too
[08/16/2007 11:41:41 AM] Robert Douglas: right
[08/16/2007 11:41:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it copies all the folders in a website into the tar
[08/16/2007 11:42:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the databases i am not sure
[08/16/2007 11:42:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe ask admins, thats what we pay them for, they can answer a question every now and then, ask them how to dumb an entire database in non interactive mode
[08/16/2007 11:42:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: or google that
[08/16/2007 11:42:54 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.devshed.com/c/a/MySQL/Backing-up-and-restoring-your-MySQL-Database/)http://www.devshed.com/c/a/MySQL/Backing-up-and-restoring-your-MySQL-Database/
[08/16/2007 11:42:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: dumb an entire database in non interactive mode
[08/16/2007 11:42:58 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > [backupfile.sql]
[08/16/2007 11:43:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah looks good
[08/16/2007 11:43:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: that will give you the sql script just like phpmyadmin does
[08/16/2007 11:43:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: so include that in the tar file too
[08/16/2007 11:43:55 AM] Robert Douglas: but how do u name the file with the current date?
[08/16/2007 11:44:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh snap
[08/16/2007 11:44:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i win
[08/16/2007 11:44:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: using `<command>` gives you the output
[08/16/2007 11:44:35 AM] Robert Douglas: ?
[08/16/2007 11:44:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you just have to format the date command
[08/16/2007 11:44:50 AM] Robert Douglas: example?
[08/16/2007 11:44:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: sec
[08/16/2007 11:45:01 AM] Robert Douglas: using
[08/16/2007 11:45:01 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > [backupfile.sql]
[08/16/2007 11:45:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok the right carrot means output
[08/16/2007 11:46:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you don't actually put the brackets with those fields
[08/16/2007 11:46:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: but > always means write to file
[08/16/2007 11:46:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if i did echo "something" > test.txt
[08/16/2007 11:46:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: that would put something in the test.txt file
[08/16/2007 11:46:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: and >> double carrot means append output
[08/16/2007 11:47:03 AM] Robert Douglas: right, the brackets just note that it is something u need to enter
[08/16/2007 11:47:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: so left carrot means input <
[08/16/2007 11:47:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: or append input <<
[08/16/2007 11:47:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: same in C
[08/16/2007 11:48:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you would use mysqldump -u username -p password databasename > `date`.sql
[08/16/2007 11:48:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: or actually you need quotes around that
[08/16/2007 11:48:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you would use mysqldump -u username -p password databasename > "`date`.sql"
[08/16/2007 11:48:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: because the standard date output has spaces
[08/16/2007 11:49:14 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > [backupfilename-`date`.sql]
[08/16/2007 11:49:29 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > [backupfilename]-`date`.sql
[08/16/2007 11:49:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: that works but don't forget the quotes
[08/16/2007 11:49:39 AM] Robert Douglas: u need quotes for the name?
[08/16/2007 11:49:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/16/2007 11:49:43 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > "[backupfilename]-`date`.sql"
[08/16/2007 11:49:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/16/2007 11:50:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: you need quotes because the date command has spaces in it
[08/16/2007 11:50:16 AM] Robert Douglas: gotcha
[08/16/2007 11:50:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you can't open it on windows because it has colons
[08/16/2007 11:50:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: unless you want to customize the date command
[08/16/2007 11:51:00 AM] Robert Douglas: it should be customized
[08/16/2007 11:51:24 AM] Robert Douglas: should be mm-dd-yyy-24hr-secs
[08/16/2007 11:51:32 AM] Robert Douglas: or any combination of that
[08/16/2007 11:51:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: `date '+%m-%d-%y-%H-%M-%S'`
[08/16/2007 11:51:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: sec let me try that
[08/16/2007 11:56:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: date '+%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S'
[08/16/2007 11:56:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: you want capital Y for 4 digit year
[08/16/2007 11:56:45 AM] Robert Douglas: mysqldump -u [username] -p [password] [databasename] > "[backupfilename]-date '+%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M-%S'.sql"
[08/16/2007 11:56:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/16/2007 11:57:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: but if you want to do an entire website put that in a folder in the clients home directory called like sql or something
[08/16/2007 11:57:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: then just tar the entire home directory
[08/16/2007 11:57:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you can put the date thing on that tar too
[08/16/2007 11:58:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: this laptop is a pain in the ass to type on
[08/16/2007 11:58:33 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[08/16/2007 11:58:34 AM] Robert Douglas: will do
[08/16/2007 11:58:40 AM] Robert Douglas: right now i gotta figure out how to connnect to mysql lol
[08/16/2007 11:58:47 AM] Robert Douglas: i type mysql in ssh
[08/16/2007 11:58:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: is it in localhost?
[08/16/2007 11:58:54 AM] Robert Douglas: and says

[08/16/2007 11:59:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: is it localhost?

[08/16/2007 11:59:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: what does that say
[08/16/2007 11:59:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: then touch /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
[08/16/2007 11:59:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: then you should be able to go

[08/16/2007 12:46:39 PM] Robert Douglas: whats the solution?
[08/16/2007 12:46:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: edit the my.cnf file under /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[08/16/2007 12:47:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/16/2007 12:50:29 PM] Robert Douglas: mysql --socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
[08/16/2007 12:50:32 PM] Robert Douglas: do i simply enter that
[08/16/2007 12:50:41 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, i should test the command before i put it in muy.cnf
[08/16/2007 12:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/16/2007 12:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't matter
[08/16/2007 12:51:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can always change the config back
[08/16/2007 12:51:17 PM] Robert Douglas: does this have potential to take down mysql

mysqldump: Got error: 1049: Unknown database 'pass123' when selecting the database
[08/16/2007 02:43:58 PM] Robert Douglas: it works if i leave out pass123
[08/16/2007 02:44:09 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont understand why it doesnt work with pass123 hardcoded into the commmand
[08/16/2007 02:46:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is another option to use the password from the command
[08/16/2007 02:46:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not -p

[08/16/2007 03:49:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/16/2007 03:49:41 PM] Robert Douglas: did u get those last 2 messages?
[08/16/2007 03:49:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: [08/16/2007 03:49:21 PM] Robert Douglas: /opt/lampp/bin/php -q /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php cmd > /opt/lampp/logs/wikicron.log >/dev/null 2>&1 
 
 [08/16/2007 03:49:28 PM] Robert Douglas: u back?
[08/16/2007 03:50:24 PM] Robert Douglas: I think my user account somehow locked the reindex.php file: 
 
[root@localhost etc]# /opt/lampp/bin/php -q /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php cmd 
Could not open input file: /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php 
 
 
When I make the reindex.php file a dupliocated file named reindex2.php, and try running it on reindex2.php, I get the same error. 
 
It worked fine until I ran this other command:
[08/16/2007 03:50:27 PM] Robert Douglas: /opt/lampp/bin/php -q /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php cmd > /opt/lampp/logs/wikicron.log >/dev/null 2>&1
[08/16/2007 03:51:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm not sure what you are trying to do
[08/16/2007 03:51:35 PM] Robert Douglas: this command worked before
[08/16/2007 03:51:36 PM] Robert Douglas: /opt/lampp/bin/php -q /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php cmd
[08/16/2007 03:51:49 PM] Robert Douglas: then i tried to get fancy and set it to go to a log file and dev/null
[08/16/2007 03:51:56 PM] Robert Douglas: then i tried that original command
[08/16/2007 03:52:03 PM] Robert Douglas: and i get unable to open input file
[08/16/2007 03:52:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm
[08/16/2007 03:53:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: did it output anything when you ran it?
[08/16/2007 03:54:00 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/16/2007 03:54:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't look wrong
[08/16/2007 03:54:10 PM] Robert Douglas: but i think the issue was with the > /opt/lampp/logs/wikicron.log >/dev/null 2>&1
[08/16/2007 03:54:27 PM] Robert Douglas: becaus eu either output a log file, or output to dev/null, but not both
[08/16/2007 03:54:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: no thats not the problem
[08/16/2007 03:55:21 PM] Robert Douglas: the log files are 0 bytes
[08/16/2007 03:55:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would output writing to wikicron.log to null
[08/16/2007 03:55:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant even get it to run now tho at all
[08/16/2007 03:55:48 PM] Robert Douglas: this no longer works: /opt/lampp/bin/php -q /opt/lampp/wiki/search/admin/reindex.php cmd
[08/16/2007 03:55:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you sure reindex.php is still in tact?
[08/16/2007 03:56:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: what error does it give you?

[08/20/2007 10:03:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i mean they said we only did what was in the contract
[08/20/2007 10:04:01 PM] Robert Douglas: that we did not do anything extra

[08/20/2007 10:05:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i told him we are holding off on all development until we figure out what's going on
[08/20/2007 10:06:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/20/2007 10:06:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he didn't like that?
[08/20/2007 10:09:46 PM] Robert Douglas: doubt it
[08/20/2007 10:09:54 PM] Robert Douglas: but i said until we get it figured out, we're not gunna do this stuff until we hear back
[08/20/2007 10:10:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: what stuff does he want us to do?
[08/20/2007 10:10:12 PM] Robert Douglas: shopping cart
[08/20/2007 10:10:18 PM] Robert Douglas: and classifieds
[08/20/2007 10:10:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess the other option would be work on it, then sell it to them
[08/20/2007 10:10:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: that must be what they are looking for
[08/20/2007 10:13:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: they don't want to pay us and then wait for us to finish
[08/20/2007 10:13:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: they want to pay us and get it immediately 
[08/20/2007 10:29:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: its your call man
[08/20/2007 10:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: sooner i work on it, sooner i cash that check for 750
[08/20/2007 10:30:05 PM] Robert Douglas: if we back off, i'm gunna work with u to return the site to how it was before
[08/20/2007 10:30:19 PM] Robert Douglas: so all the extra shit we did, is going to be removed
[08/20/2007 10:30:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: my vote it we write it, because it won't take long, then when they see what we can do, they will want to throw their money at us
[08/20/2007 10:31:05 PM] Robert Douglas: no,wehave already made a rock solidproduct
[08/20/2007 10:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think we should back off
[08/20/2007 10:31:12 PM] Robert Douglas: it looks super sexy
[08/20/2007 10:31:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are getting a percentage though
[08/20/2007 10:31:16 PM] Robert Douglas: and they dont appreciate it
[08/20/2007 10:31:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: that bad eh?
[08/20/2007 10:31:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/20/2007 10:31:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: they were pissed?
[08/20/2007 10:31:36 PM] Robert Douglas: rps is supposed to be partner
[08/20/2007 10:31:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: well what would they have us do to fix this problem?
[08/20/2007 10:32:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do they want us to do?
[08/20/2007 10:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: fortunately for you i kept a subversion a long time ago of jambonie
[08/20/2007 10:33:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if we have to revert it won't take much
[08/20/2007 10:33:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'd rather fix our relationship with them, instead of retaliate
[08/20/2007 10:35:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you should go to them and say "my developer will write these next two sections for free, as long as you pay us on time, you will get the classifieds and store when you pay us"
[08/20/2007 10:36:00 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/20/2007 10:36:04 PM] Robert Douglas: also, we cant revert back
[08/20/2007 10:36:09 PM] Robert Douglas: because we fixed lots of error
[08/20/2007 10:36:10 PM] Robert Douglas: s
[08/20/2007 10:36:20 PM] Robert Douglas: we have to actually completely removecertain features
[08/20/2007 10:36:27 PM] Robert Douglas: but we'll talk more about it later
[08/20/2007 10:36:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what to they actually want from us?
[08/20/2007 10:36:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i dunno
[08/20/2007 10:36:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: we can't fight with all our clients
[08/20/2007 10:36:50 PM] Robert Douglas: still trying 2 figure it all out
[08/20/2007 10:37:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't think we should lose this client
[08/20/2007 10:37:51 PM] Robert Douglas: neither do i, but client has acted like this before
[08/20/2007 10:37:56 PM] Robert Douglas: jambo consists of 3 ppl
[08/20/2007 10:38:00 PM] Robert Douglas: two clients, and rps
[08/20/2007 10:38:03 PM] Robert Douglas: one client is dumb
[08/20/2007 10:38:12 PM] Robert Douglas: the other is smart, neither knows technology
[08/20/2007 10:38:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, well if we do back out, lets leave the site as is
[08/20/2007 10:38:49 PM] Robert Douglas: if we back out, we're going to have to remove the flash video thing
[08/20/2007 10:38:53 PM] Robert Douglas: and put a gay quicktime player
[08/20/2007 10:39:00 PM] Robert Douglas: quicktime/windows media player
[08/20/2007 10:39:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah we can't afford that thing
[08/20/2007 10:39:24 PM] Robert Douglas: well, that was completely extra
[08/20/2007 10:39:35 PM] Robert Douglas: so we will remove it if the client gets gay
[08/20/2007 10:39:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: well there is a lot that i added that wasn't in the original spec
[08/20/2007 10:39:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i replied to ur svn stuff, if u need something else from me, plz reply via that email
[08/20/2007 10:40:04 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, we'll spend a couple days removing it
[08/20/2007 10:40:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know man i think if we back out we should just let it go
[08/20/2007 10:40:50 PM] Robert Douglas: we cant
[08/20/2007 10:40:58 PM] Robert Douglas: it will be a good lesson for the client
[08/20/2007 10:41:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[08/20/2007 10:41:09 PM] Robert Douglas: we have 8 main buttons at the top
[08/20/2007 10:41:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are not teaching lessons, they have to pay for those
[08/20/2007 10:41:23 PM] Robert Douglas: original spec wasonly a couplecategories
[08/20/2007 10:42:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah yeah yeah, but lets not create more work for ourselves by teaching them a lesson they will learn on their own eventually
[08/20/2007 10:42:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: they will go nowhere without us
[08/20/2007 10:42:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: you forget, code needs maintenence 
[08/20/2007 10:42:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but also we have tons of sexy features that werent originally included
[08/20/2007 10:43:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: they can keep them as a sign of goodwill
[08/20/2007 10:43:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: their reference is just as important as any other site in the portfolio
[08/20/2007 10:43:44 PM] Robert Douglas: they will leave unhappy either way
[08/20/2007 10:43:53 PM] Robert Douglas: but this is something we'll talk about later, once we know what's up

[08/23/2007 03:44:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need the download link for the sugar version, i dont see the current one available for download
[08/23/2007 03:44:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: 4.5.1d

[08/23/2007 03:46:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just do not see 4.5.1d

[08/23/2007 03:46:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't find 4.5.1d on the site

[08/23/2007 03:46:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and 4.5.0
[08/23/2007 03:47:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i will work on the KB, but it would be easier if i could copy code to convert the kb template right in dreamweaver instead of having to use the code view in firefox, so please just change the directory
[08/23/2007 03:47:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am using the login information that is in pmxp
[08/23/2007 03:47:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: rps1984

[08/23/2007 03:52:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so how about you log in and find 4.5.1d and send me a link
[08/23/2007 03:52:23 PM] Robert Douglas: when u go to that link, it asks u for a download key

[08/23/2007 03:52:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you can look into the cases that we have submitted and follow the instructions on the last post

[08/23/2007 04:16:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont have the old sugar files
[08/23/2007 04:16:20 PM] Robert Douglas: you will need to ask for that in the support case, or upgrade to the latest version and then continue with sugar
[08/23/2007 04:16:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, maybe we should just upgrade
[08/23/2007 04:17:09 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as u dont think it will break anything, go forward with an upgrade
[08/23/2007 04:17:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've never done one, any suggestions?
[08/23/2007 04:17:32 PM] Robert Douglas: never upgraded sugar?

[08/23/2007 04:40:02 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/23/2007 04:40:19 PM] Robert Douglas: make sure ur fw is setup to forward ur port to ur internal ip
[08/23/2007 04:40:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is
[08/23/2007 04:41:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: works for me
[08/23/2007 04:42:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: you might have to retry because my isp sucks

[08/23/2007 04:44:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: sec
[08/23/2007 04:44:27 PM] Robert Douglas: still doesnt work
[08/23/2007 04:44:35 PM] Robert Douglas: means issue is with ur routeri think
[08/23/2007 04:44:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: no its a software problem
[08/23/2007 04:45:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it worked fine before
[08/23/2007 04:45:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: works on localhost
[08/23/2007 04:45:34 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, so the software works fine, you just gotta make sure ur router knows where to route to
[08/23/2007 04:45:56 PM] Robert Douglas: 62820 is a large port number
[08/23/2007 04:46:01 PM] Robert Douglas: possibly try something else,dunno
[08/23/2007 04:46:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i have all 62000-63000 going to my internal router
[08/23/2007 04:47:12 PM] Robert Douglas: try another port
[08/23/2007 04:47:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: then 62820 and 62920 going to my desktop
[08/23/2007 04:47:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i need a restart because fucking ultravnc is gay
[08/23/2007 04:48:20 PM] Robert Douglas: u said it was working
[08/23/2007 04:48:26 PM] Robert Douglas: just cant get the ports to forward

[08/23/2007 05:08:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: wtf
[08/23/2007 05:08:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't get it to work
[08/23/2007 05:08:27 PM] Robert Douglas: lol

[08/23/2007 05:11:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i liked super man when he is the shit, not a little pretty boy
[08/23/2007 05:15:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: you change the default folder for kb ftp?
[08/23/2007 05:19:45 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[08/23/2007 05:19:53 PM] Robert Douglas: i replied asking u why u need access to the template files
[08/23/2007 05:20:03 PM] Robert Douglas: there's nothing hiding, i'm just curious
[08/23/2007 05:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, 1 so i can use dreamweaver to copy template styles, and 2 because not the install instructions say i should put a folder output public_html so its not publicly available
[08/23/2007 05:21:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: *now
[08/23/2007 05:21:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm just worried about something gettingoverwritten
[08/23/2007 05:21:54 PM] Robert Douglas: or something happening
[08/23/2007 05:21:58 PM] Robert Douglas: that fucks something else up
[08/23/2007 05:22:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll try not to be a fuckup
[08/23/2007 05:22:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wanted to download the new site anyways
[08/23/2007 05:22:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i'll keep a back up and same directory structure
[08/23/2007 05:22:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and using dreamweaver and instead of firefox
[08/23/2007 05:22:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm working on the site though throughout the day
[08/23/2007 05:22:55 PM] Robert Douglas: hang on a sec
[08/23/2007 05:23:08 PM] Robert Douglas: the template styles you shouldnt touch
[08/23/2007 05:23:18 PM] Robert Douglas: for the template styles, all u need to do is include the css file
[08/23/2007 05:24:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i won't need to touch the template files, just read whats already defined in order to apply it to the kb
[08/23/2007 05:24:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have to copy some code from index page to make the kb fit inside rps style
[08/23/2007 05:24:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: like divs and such
[08/23/2007 05:24:42 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that's included in the dir you have access to
[08/23/2007 05:24:47 PM] Robert Douglas: but the style css file isnt
[08/23/2007 05:24:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only see an empty file
[08/23/2007 05:25:18 PM] Robert Douglas: <?php $page_title="Support - Knowledge Base"; include("/home/rps/public_html/_includes/header.inc.php"); ?>

[08/23/2007 05:25:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can either trust me to copy content out of other pages that i need to use, or you can do it yourself
[08/23/2007 05:25:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: so why don't we go with the second options
[08/23/2007 05:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i listed 2 reasons i need you to change the directory
[08/23/2007 05:26:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so you are saying that the code for this page is blank?
[08/23/2007 05:26:00 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/index.php)http://www.rp-s.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/index.php
[08/23/2007 05:26:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see the code but what about heading styles and such
[08/23/2007 05:26:47 PM] Robert Douglas: so you do see it, or "i only see an empty file"
[08/23/2007 05:27:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i exaggerated
[08/23/2007 05:27:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: it looked like just a list of includes
[08/23/2007 05:27:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: but thats fine, you can take over installing the kb
[08/23/2007 05:28:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: take a look at the install readme file, it will explain where to put directories
[08/23/2007 05:29:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=144153)http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=144153
[08/23/2007 05:29:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is the download link
[08/23/2007 05:29:10 PM] Robert Douglas: im looking at it right now
[08/23/2007 05:29:37 PM] Robert Douglas: u can put the kb_file under the Knowledge-Base dir
[08/23/2007 05:29:43 PM] Robert Douglas: we wont use file uploads
[08/23/2007 05:30:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what else is wrong with giving me access to a higher directory?
[08/23/2007 05:30:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there a reason you won't do it?
[08/23/2007 05:30:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: you just want to be controlling?
[08/23/2007 05:30:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't trust me?
[08/23/2007 05:30:47 PM] Robert Douglas: when we do project specific tasks,only access is given to the specific dir of the project
[08/23/2007 05:30:58 PM] Robert Douglas: at ebay, u have to request access to each area you need
[08/23/2007 05:31:03 PM] Robert Douglas: if you dont "need" it,then u dont get it
[08/23/2007 05:31:06 PM] Robert Douglas: when i work on the rps site
[08/23/2007 05:31:09 PM] Robert Douglas: using dreamweaver
[08/23/2007 05:31:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what directory are you using?
[08/23/2007 05:31:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i have my own account for public html, so it doesn't affect anything below that
[08/23/2007 05:31:33 PM] Robert Douglas: in case DW messes up,it wont affet anyhting below
[08/23/2007 05:31:42 PM] Robert Douglas: but i need access to that, simply because i edit those files
[08/23/2007 05:31:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i require something with a high level to install this and you don't give it to me, why is that?
[08/23/2007 05:31:58 PM] Robert Douglas: if you need access to another dir, let me know and why
[08/23/2007 05:32:12 PM] Robert Douglas: according to the install, u only need access to the kb dir
[08/23/2007 05:32:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did let you know
[08/23/2007 05:32:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you still refused
[08/23/2007 05:32:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you go ahead and install it
[08/23/2007 05:32:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am out
[08/23/2007 05:32:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't work on a project when i don't have the access
[08/23/2007 05:32:42 PM] Robert Douglas: and i just told u that we're not doing file uploads, so u dont need it
[08/23/2007 05:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you telling me that   <h1>Knowledge <span class="redtext">Base</span></h1>
 
[08/23/2007 05:33:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: is the only code used in the template
[08/23/2007 05:33:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only classes?
[08/23/2007 05:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: you use redtext and probably a global definition for h1
[08/23/2007 05:33:28 PM] Robert Douglas: view the css file
[08/23/2007 05:33:35 PM] Robert Douglas: all the styles are in their
[08/23/2007 05:34:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you don't think i should get access to the other files for viewing them in DW then i can't work on this project anymore
[08/23/2007 05:34:36 PM] Robert Douglas: just tell me what u need access to and why
[08/23/2007 05:34:41 PM] Robert Douglas: that's all i ask
[08/23/2007 05:35:00 PM] Robert Douglas: you said u need access to public html so you could do the file upload, but you don't have to put the file upload in that location, and we're not using the file upload
[08/23/2007 05:35:04 PM] Robert Douglas: so thus u dont need access to that
[08/23/2007 05:35:09 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm ready for the next reason

[08/23/2007 05:39:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i only grant access to the stuff i need
[08/23/2007 05:39:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: so until that changes you can work on your KB project alone, i have other things to do

[08/23/2007 05:40:00 PM] Robert Douglas: which u wont get
[08/23/2007 05:40:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i believe that i need it in order to apply the template
[08/23/2007 05:40:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you believe otherwise
[08/23/2007 05:40:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe if you set aside your ego we could come to an agreement
[08/23/2007 05:40:51 PM] Robert Douglas: reply to my email telling me what u need access to and why
[08/23/2007 05:40:55 PM] Robert Douglas: that's all i ask
[08/23/2007 05:40:57 PM] Robert Douglas: it is very very simple
[08/23/2007 05:41:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to be able to look at how other styles on pages are applied in order to use the same code for applying the style on the KB pages
[08/23/2007 05:41:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you can't give me access to do that, then i can't work on this project with you
[08/23/2007 05:41:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean what is the big fucking deal?
[08/23/2007 05:41:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: just change the directory
[08/23/2007 05:41:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: just fucking do it
[08/23/2007 05:42:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not going to ask again
[08/23/2007 05:42:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you want me to work on this project, just fucking do it
[08/23/2007 05:42:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: or don't ask me to do you fucking busy work
[08/23/2007 05:42:32 PM] Robert Douglas: u wont get access to ANY directory, unless it is needed
[08/23/2007 05:42:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i explained to you why i needed it
[08/23/2007 05:42:45 PM] Robert Douglas: same goes for everyione, not you
[08/23/2007 05:42:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: so just fucking do it
[08/23/2007 05:43:04 PM] Robert Douglas: so u need to view the code for other pages, np, i'll give u those pages
[08/23/2007 05:43:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could just as well get them through ftp
[08/23/2007 05:43:28 PM] Robert Douglas: agreed

[08/27/2007 03:43:06 PM] Robert Douglas: all the AZRN pages were overwritten by old ones
[08/27/2007 03:43:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i havent been home all day, so I couldn't have had access to overwrite them all
[08/27/2007 03:46:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it didn't happen today, i haven't logged on to that site for 2 weeks
[08/27/2007 03:46:42 PM] Robert Douglas: it shows the files were updated on the 27th
[08/27/2007 03:47:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i think when you opened the pages to look at the code in DW, and just clicked save, it overwrote the pages on azrn
[08/27/2007 03:47:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope haven't even opened the pages yet
[08/27/2007 03:47:19 PM] Robert Douglas: the files are timestamped for the 27th
[08/27/2007 03:47:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i actually don't have any of the files on my computer
[08/27/2007 03:47:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are still only stored in my personal SVN
[08/27/2007 03:47:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know how they got overwritten but it wasn't me
[08/27/2007 03:48:11 PM] Robert Douglas: can u upload the files, because someone logged on and overwrote them on the 27th
[08/27/2007 03:48:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats today
[08/27/2007 03:48:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i put the up to date membership signup on their, but the renew and details page probably needs to be uploaded too
[08/27/2007 03:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it possible that the client has been mistakenly overwriting files?
[08/27/2007 03:49:09 PM] Robert Douglas: possibly, i'll ask
[08/27/2007 03:49:35 PM] Robert Douglas: in hte mean time, can u log in and upload the latest files
[08/27/2007 03:49:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i have the latest mebmber signup
[08/27/2007 03:49:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so membership signup, renew and details?
[08/27/2007 03:49:58 PM] Robert Douglas: just renew and details
[08/27/2007 03:50:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you sure membership signup isn't an older version?
[08/27/2007 03:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: does it forward to the renew page with firstname and lastname in the link?
[08/27/2007 03:50:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i have dates on those for the 12th/13th
[08/27/2007 03:51:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok those should be right, but that still doesn't explain why it wasn't in the database, why don't you just add that person now and see if it shows up
[08/27/2007 03:51:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: use only first and last name
[08/27/2007 03:53:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i uploaded the Details.php file i have dated the 12th
[08/27/2007 03:53:17 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have anything newer than that 1?
[08/27/2007 03:53:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah as i recall you should have them too
[08/27/2007 03:53:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you changed the text last
[08/27/2007 03:55:31 PM] Robert Douglas: We have modified the script to include this check to make sure that members 
with expiration dates that are greater than 1 year away, will not have 1 
year added to their expiration date, but instead will have their expiration 
date changed to the current year + 1. So when the member that expired in 
2006 renews their membership, the date will be changed to 2008 (the current 
year) + 1 to give a final 
[08/27/2007 03:55:40 PM] Robert Douglas: can u verify that the current file set still does that
[08/27/2007 03:58:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/27/2007 03:58:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me make sure the uploaded files are current
[08/27/2007 03:58:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have some from the 15th
[08/27/2007 03:58:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am sure Iterator and details might need to be updated
[08/27/2007 03:58:43 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/27/2007 03:58:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i think u might have 1 or 2 files that are more current than what i have
[08/27/2007 03:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: but before that it was the 10th so i think we just went through a few text changes, and i have evidence that i downloaded all the files before finally commiting them to my SVN for the last time
[08/27/2007 04:00:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i see .htaccess files being added, and that DB dump that was still up there
[08/27/2007 04:00:33 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[08/27/2007 04:00:43 PM] Robert Douglas: let me know when u have everything checked
[08/27/2007 04:00:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll re-download everything again then
[08/27/2007 04:01:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: details is way different
[08/27/2007 04:01:29 PM] Robert Douglas: it seems to have a ton of spaces everytime i download it
[08/27/2007 04:01:31 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno why tho
[08/27/2007 04:01:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: woah
[08/27/2007 04:01:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is freakin me out man
[08/27/2007 04:02:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: no my copy of renew is larger
[08/27/2007 04:02:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: same with details
[08/27/2007 04:02:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking damnit
[08/27/2007 04:02:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: check out the date on all the other files
[08/27/2007 04:03:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: the ones we don't even mess with
[08/27/2007 04:03:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the client must be overwritting them
[08/27/2007 04:03:39 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll call her, she might have told yahoo to restore something, which ended up restoring all of the new files with the old ones
[08/27/2007 04:04:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like i got the right files
[08/27/2007 04:04:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i recognize the final text changes you made
[08/27/2007 04:04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome
[08/27/2007 04:04:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you try to register that one person?
[08/27/2007 04:04:39 PM] Robert Douglas: no, not yet
[08/27/2007 04:04:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got it pulled up
[08/27/2007 04:04:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i
[08/27/2007 04:04:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: ll do it
[08/27/2007 04:07:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude check out the dbadmin
[08/27/2007 04:08:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: something else went wrong, i don't even think that page is the right one
[08/27/2007 04:08:14 PM] Robert Douglas: no, that looks right
[08/27/2007 04:08:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: all that shit is reordered wrong
[08/27/2007 04:08:23 PM] Robert Douglas: oh, u mean the view members one
[08/27/2007 04:08:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: all the pink and white are supposed to be together
[08/27/2007 04:08:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are all mixed up
[08/27/2007 04:08:39 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i thought u were working on it
[08/27/2007 04:08:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: in dbadmin you didn't tell me i needed to reupload those
[08/27/2007 04:09:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think maybe the database login changed
[08/27/2007 04:10:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: you sent me new login, and i put it in, but since it was overwritten its not able to add members to database
[08/27/2007 04:12:03 PM] Robert Douglas: db login is same
[08/27/2007 04:12:08 PM] Robert Douglas: dk1227
[08/27/2007 04:12:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think login info has changed
[08/27/2007 04:12:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: k well i am not getting any error reporting from yahoo
[08/27/2007 04:12:30 PM] Robert Douglas: if it did, it wouldnt be able to connect to the db at all
[08/27/2007 04:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: furthermore, looking over the code you made changes to when fixing the descriptions i see a lot of mistakes
[08/27/2007 04:13:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there a reason all the closing <td> tags are missing?
[08/27/2007 04:13:12 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[08/27/2007 04:13:17 PM] Robert Douglas: dont worry about html code
[08/27/2007 04:13:23 PM] Robert Douglas: just try to get the files up to date
[08/27/2007 04:13:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: well my last option is to update all of them because it looks like they are all messed up
[08/27/2007 04:14:18 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as it is the most recent, then do that
[08/27/2007 04:14:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am worried about the HTML, there is no excuse for writing shitty code, and it could cause more problems
[08/27/2007 04:15:46 PM] Robert Douglas: everything i  changed displayed fine
[08/27/2007 04:16:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because it displays ok doesn't mean you are allowed to leave off tags
[08/27/2007 04:16:26 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but right now we gotta get it up and running again
[08/27/2007 04:16:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: work on your indents i think that would help to find missing levels in the tree
[08/27/2007 04:17:25 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont really care if this had valid html output
[08/27/2007 04:17:37 PM] Robert Douglas: this project has been such a pain, that all i care about is getting it fully working
[08/27/2007 04:18:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i'm afraid there is nothing more i can do other then put these pages back
[08/27/2007 04:18:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am abandoning the project
[08/27/2007 04:18:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i had it working entirely
[08/27/2007 04:18:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and someone else if overwritting my files
[08/27/2007 04:18:59 PM] Robert Douglas: this would be the first time that the issue was with the client
[08/27/2007 04:19:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i shouldn't be held liable for that happening, also with lack of error reporting it makes my job impossible
[08/27/2007 04:19:14 PM] Robert Douglas: assuming that is what happened, you're right, there is nothing we can do
[08/27/2007 04:19:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so while i am fixing this, consider giving yahoo another call about error reporting
[08/27/2007 04:19:54 PM] Robert Douglas: yahoo doesnt care
[08/27/2007 04:19:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is not the first time this happened though
[08/27/2007 04:20:18 PM] Robert Douglas: first time we've seen the client do something to mess it up, and first time we've seen our files overwritten by someone else
[08/27/2007 04:21:06 PM] Robert Douglas: i have to head out to class in 5 mins
[08/27/2007 04:21:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: well just so you know, every file that i just uploaded was a completely different size as the one on the server
[08/27/2007 04:22:36 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that sucks
[08/27/2007 04:22:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to call the client on my way to class
[08/27/2007 04:23:40 PM] Robert Douglas: alright, gotta jet
[08/27/2007 04:34:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know man this one really has me stumped

[08/27/2007 10:08:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never replaced those files, ruining the system, i shouldn't have to deal with the consequences
[08/27/2007 10:09:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if everything was organized, it would be a simple upload to fix everything
[08/27/2007 10:09:32 PM] Robert Douglas: but neither of us have all of the current files
[08/27/2007 10:09:37 PM] Robert Douglas: u made minor changes to some
[08/27/2007 10:09:46 PM] Robert Douglas: then i only downloaded th eones i was making minor changes to
[08/27/2007 10:09:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if you think that will help
[08/27/2007 10:10:13 PM] Robert Douglas: it would be incredibly helpful if u had the entire fileset, i should also have it in case something happens
[08/27/2007 10:10:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i should have kept a downlaod of the latest files
[08/27/2007 10:10:39 PM] Robert Douglas: but i never did
[08/27/2007 10:10:48 PM] Robert Douglas: some were on my comp, some were on the ebay comp
[08/27/2007 10:11:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i just overwrote everything so it is gone now
[08/27/2007 10:11:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the problem still exists
[08/27/2007 10:11:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you sure the database is still in tact?
[08/27/2007 10:12:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is interesting
[08/27/2007 10:12:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i am getting a reasonable error
[08/27/2007 10:13:05 PM] Robert Douglas: if ur doing anything that might mess up the db, please make sure u have a backup of the db
[08/27/2007 10:13:51 PM] Robert Douglas: nvm, i just downloaded  abckupo
[08/27/2007 10:13:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope still nothing
[08/27/2007 10:14:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't show any relevant errors
[08/27/2007 10:14:26 PM] Robert Douglas: dont forget that some files included the dbadmin/files
[08/27/2007 10:14:39 PM] Robert Douglas: at one point we had details.php on their twice
[08/27/2007 10:14:45 PM] Robert Douglas: and iterator twice
[08/27/2007 10:14:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[08/27/2007 10:14:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i fixed that
[08/27/2007 10:15:03 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[08/27/2007 10:15:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: got it
[08/27/2007 10:15:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: somehow fax was still in the membership signup
[08/27/2007 10:15:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: which means when you updated the text for it, you didn't download the latest copy
[08/27/2007 10:15:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: could be because i didn't tell you i fixed it
[08/27/2007 10:16:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but now it appears to be working
[08/27/2007 10:16:15 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt remove anything from the mysql->query
[08/27/2007 10:16:21 PM] Robert Douglas: if that was the part that contained the fax
[08/27/2007 10:16:35 PM] Robert Douglas: but i re downlaoded everything each time to make sure it was100%
[08/27/2007 10:16:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm saying we were working with wrong versions
[08/27/2007 10:16:51 PM] Robert Douglas: didnt u upload the member signp tho?
[08/27/2007 10:18:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is plenty of blame to go around but this still doesn't explain how any of the other files got replaced
[08/27/2007 10:19:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i have homework to get done
[08/27/2007 10:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: talk to you tomorrow
[08/27/2007 10:19:37 PM] Robert Douglas: goodnight
[08/27/2007 10:19:44 PM] Robert Douglas: thx for fixing it, i'm redownloading everything

[09/25/2007 10:22:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought it was only 5
[09/25/2007 10:22:48 PM] Robert Douglas: what was 5?
[09/25/2007 10:22:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: a domain
[09/25/2007 10:23:08 PM] Robert Douglas: normally $15/yr
[09/25/2007 10:23:21 PM] Robert Douglas: but i can give u $5 off coupon
[09/25/2007 10:23:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: can i have it forwarded to any IP?
[09/25/2007 10:24:09 PM] Robert Douglas: ya
[09/25/2007 10:24:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: k 15 is fine i don't mind
[09/25/2007 10:32:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to bed, if u gunna order domain now, i'll stay up for a min to process it all

[09/26/2007 07:25:13 PM] Robert Douglas: the server specifies the directory
[09/26/2007 07:25:17 PM] Robert Douglas: inty he virtual hosts i believe
[09/26/2007 07:25:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i saw a domain service that you could enter an http address
[09/26/2007 07:26:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tried to explain the virtual hosts to my professor but i don't think he really got it
[09/26/2007 07:26:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i might just host the website myself
[09/26/2007 07:27:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could use a proxy pass
[09/26/2007 07:27:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will buy the domain tomorrow, and probably just need you to forward it to my server
[09/26/2007 07:27:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: does rp-s make money off of my purchase?
[09/26/2007 07:27:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah like $5 perdomain
[09/26/2007 07:28:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool, thats fine, i will have the other group members contribute to the domain cost
[09/26/2007 07:28:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it will only cost me 1.25
[09/26/2007 07:28:52 PM] Robert Douglas: normally we dont do domain forwarding, but i'll setit up for free
[09/26/2007 07:29:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[09/26/2007 07:29:03 PM] Robert Douglas: np
[09/26/2007 07:29:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: save me the trouble of signing up with some other service
[09/26/2007 07:29:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty buzzed
[09/26/2007 07:30:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am working out and working at IT tomorrow, no classes, so i thought that no classes was a good reason to get drunk
[09/26/2007 07:31:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is life? i haven't had a decent conversation with you in weeks?
[09/26/2007 07:31:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: any more azrn problems?
[09/26/2007 07:32:14 PM] Robert Douglas: just keeping really busy with school
[09/26/2007 07:32:29 PM] Robert Douglas: client had another expired signup, and it worked
[09/26/2007 07:32:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so whatever the last change was fixed it
[09/26/2007 07:32:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[09/26/2007 07:32:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: we'll see
[09/26/2007 07:32:56 PM] Robert Douglas: thx for fixing it
[09/26/2007 07:34:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: gosh last change was moving InvNum to the original page (despite new member/renewal) and a ridiculous fix, hard to imagine all those problems were caused by when it generated InvNum
[09/26/2007 07:35:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we will see if it works
[09/26/2007 07:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: am i still fired?
[09/26/2007 07:35:52 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, u and me wont ever work well together
[09/26/2007 07:36:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats true
[09/26/2007 07:36:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i start my company, i am going to base it on the philosophy that happy employees make the best workers
[09/26/2007 07:37:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats something that you and Alex never took into consideration
[09/26/2007 07:38:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of like google, every employee means a lot to the company, and has meaningful opinions
[09/26/2007 07:38:26 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what we do
[09/26/2007 07:38:36 PM] Robert Douglas: and why you're not with us, because we weren't happy
[09/26/2007 07:39:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't feel like you guys were treating my opinions as meaningful as they should be
[09/26/2007 07:39:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i certainly wasn't a happy employee, and therefore, you lost me
[09/26/2007 07:40:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you think you can take that risk with every employee, then i guess you aren't doing anything wrong
[09/26/2007 07:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you been able to replace me?
[09/26/2007 07:40:51 PM] Robert Douglas: we have lots of programmers
[09/26/2007 07:41:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but i was more then just a programmer
[09/26/2007 07:41:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am a developer
[09/26/2007 07:41:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't just write websites, i helped develop the company
[09/26/2007 07:42:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: so no matter where you are now, i had an influence on that
[09/26/2007 07:42:11 PM] Robert Douglas: what did u do?
[09/26/2007 07:44:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i helped discover the full potential of sugar workflows, i proposed usage of a versioning system, i contributed to a lot of concepts and designs of websites (including rp-s.com), i implemented reusable code for many future websites
[09/26/2007 07:44:12 PM] Robert Douglas: u updated sugar a bit, i remember that
[09/26/2007 07:44:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's just to name a few
[09/26/2007 07:44:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: the most recent subject i can remember
[09/26/2007 07:45:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what really saddens me is your lack of recognition for my work, i guess my value is not very great to you, and thats the reason we cannot work together
[09/26/2007 07:45:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: you think that my ideas and services are expendable
[09/26/2007 07:45:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and its truly sad because i thought i offered more then expendable services
[09/26/2007 07:46:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i know u worked with sugar a bit,but never had a complete protocol or final working version
[09/26/2007 07:46:14 PM] Robert Douglas: you had the idea of the svn, but couldnt get it to work
[09/26/2007 07:47:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so good luck to you, when i start my own company, i will use your mistakes as an outline of paths NOT to take
[09/26/2007 07:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe someday i will acquire your company
[09/26/2007 07:47:20 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[09/26/2007 07:47:33 PM] Robert Douglas: if you program anything like u did in azrn, it will be years before anything gets done
[09/26/2007 07:48:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you knew how to program like i did with AZRN, your company would be far ahead of where it is now
[09/26/2007 07:48:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's too bad you couldn't keep me around, because i think with my father being an initial investor, i will have the resources to create an unstoppable company
[09/26/2007 07:50:02 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll be ok
[09/26/2007 07:50:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides, i'm only finishing a CS degree, when i finish my business graduate degree things will be different, i still have 40 years to create my dream company
[09/26/2007 07:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what ever you and Alex have now will be entirely irrelevant by then
[09/26/2007 07:51:47 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[09/26/2007 07:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'm glad you are optimistic, shows potential, i just wish you had to foresight to see how good i was for the company
[09/26/2007 07:53:07 PM] Robert Douglas: alex and myself had quite a few talks about u
[09/26/2007 07:53:23 PM] Robert Douglas: we saw u had the ability to have a passion
[09/26/2007 07:53:30 PM] Robert Douglas: which is a good trait that will help u with your company
[09/26/2007 07:53:39 PM] Robert Douglas: because passion is a lot
[09/26/2007 07:56:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i uiploaded some pics of my bike: (Link: www.mym50.com)www.mym50.com
[09/26/2007 07:56:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: well thats good, were any of those talks about how no matter what working environment you are in, there will always be people that you don't get along with? But in the end whether or not you get along with a person doesn't matter because work still needs to get done.  I think that is your biggest flaw, work can't get done with partners, in the end someone has to take a stand and make decisions.  You guys don't have the ability to do that.
[09/26/2007 07:57:30 PM] Robert Douglas: if we couldn't make decisions, we wouldn't be 99% up and running
[09/26/2007 07:57:42 PM] Robert Douglas: we're pretty much done with everything
[09/26/2007 07:58:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: really? so a lot changed in the last 2 weeks?
[09/26/2007 07:59:14 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, accounting fully setup, hosting/domains up and running
[09/26/2007 07:59:16 PM] Robert Douglas: website is online
[09/26/2007 07:59:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i hope someday you can take advantage of my skill and hire me as a specialist.
[09/26/2007 07:59:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that definitely wasn't all the problems the company had, but it's nice to see something got done
[09/26/2007 08:00:03 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, there's a lot more that is all done
[09/26/2007 08:00:59 PM] Robert Douglas: once u get some more php/mysql sites done, feelfree to send me a message
[09/26/2007 08:01:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i'm glad, this might have been the biggest step since i joined the partnership
[09/26/2007 08:01:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand, i have done plenty of php/mysql sites, once you implement some kind of software engineering system, feel free to send me a request
[09/26/2007 08:02:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: *implemented
[09/26/2007 08:02:23 PM] Robert Douglas: what we have now is perfectly fine for other developers
[09/26/2007 08:02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: soi doubt that will change much, but that just goes back to us not being able to work together
[09/26/2007 08:03:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i think you should implement a software engineering system, such as a waterfall or iterative system, it's good for any company and any type of project
[09/26/2007 08:03:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'm not going to bother trying to explain it to you, it would take too much time, and i am way too drunk
[09/26/2007 08:04:24 PM] Robert Douglas: well, maybe u can do one for your company
[09/26/2007 08:05:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah probably, i guess someday we will find out who comes out on top
[09/26/2007 08:05:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it was nice working with you while we got along
[09/26/2007 08:05:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so until i start my own company feel free to contact me for specialist work
[09/26/2007 08:05:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i hope we can remain friends
[09/26/2007 08:05:53 PM] Robert Douglas: yea np
[09/26/2007 08:08:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll call you sometime when i'm in photown we can go to lunch again

[11/18/2007 12:45:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: click drag and resize
[11/18/2007 12:46:00 PM] Robert Douglas: dine
[11/18/2007 12:46:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need the black to cover up the entire area to enable and disable the textbox
[11/18/2007 12:47:00 PM] Robert Douglas: and?
[11/18/2007 12:47:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: see what i am trying to acheive
[11/18/2007 12:47:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't figure out the CSS to make it do that
[11/18/2007 12:49:57 PM] Robert Douglas: so u are trying to make the white area black?
[11/18/2007 12:50:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[11/18/2007 12:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: to cover up everything within the white area
[11/18/2007 12:50:15 PM] Robert Douglas: well u have the .input class assigned to white bg
[11/18/2007 12:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i just need to cover it up
[11/18/2007 12:50:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it appears like the textbox is not editable
[11/18/2007 12:50:57 PM] Robert Douglas: so u cant even see the textbox?
[11/18/2007 12:51:14 PM] Robert Douglas: you can make the textbox not editable
[11/18/2007 12:51:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i will take away the black and it will show through but you still can't click on it
[11/18/2007 12:51:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and these are going to be groups of objects
[11/18/2007 12:51:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: not just 1 textbox
[11/18/2007 12:52:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats why i don't want to have to iterate through every object and set the readonly on them
[11/18/2007 12:52:31 PM] Robert Douglas: you could apply one of those lightbox type scripts
[11/18/2007 12:52:38 PM] Robert Douglas: to overlay above the textboxes
[11/18/2007 12:52:47 PM] Robert Douglas: as opposed to require it on page click,do it on page load
[11/18/2007 12:53:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[11/18/2007 01:08:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/cs386/formdesigner.html)http://209.250.30.30/cs386/formdesigner.html
[11/18/2007 01:08:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the effect i am going for
[11/18/2007 01:08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like u got it
[11/18/2007 01:08:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had to add something to resize the cover box
[11/18/2007 01:09:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it has a fairly low overhead
[11/18/2007 01:09:18 PM] Robert Douglas: what'st he point of it?
[11/18/2007 01:09:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: you dbl click to edit
[11/18/2007 01:10:06 PM] Robert Douglas: u can do that with javascript already
[11/18/2007 01:10:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: how so?
[11/18/2007 01:10:34 PM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt have a nice moving box surrounding it tho
[11/18/2007 01:10:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh the dbl click to edit?
[11/18/2007 01:10:51 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[11/18/2007 01:11:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes but multiple input controls are included in 1 box
[11/18/2007 01:11:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it disables and enables all of them
[11/18/2007 01:11:34 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds good
[11/18/2007 01:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: why doesn't the checkbox check
[11/18/2007 01:13:29 PM] Robert Douglas: no idea
[11/18/2007 01:13:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats weird
[11/18/2007 01:13:56 PM] Robert Douglas: try adding a drop down box
[11/18/2007 01:16:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: that works
[11/18/2007 01:16:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: the disable never really works though

[11/28/2007 03:34:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta format this hard drive without using windows
[11/28/2007 03:34:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: knoppix
[11/28/2007 03:34:38 PM] Robert Douglas: but everything i read with fdisk, only talks about fat16/32 formats
[11/28/2007 03:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: do fat 32
[11/28/2007 03:34:55 PM] Robert Douglas: ntfs is better than fat32
[11/28/2007 03:34:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can convert fat 32 to ntfs
[11/28/2007 03:35:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: with a windows recovery disk
[11/28/2007 03:35:16 PM] Robert Douglas: it is going in my raid, so it needs correct format first
[11/28/2007 03:35:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: use a windows recovery disk
[11/28/2007 03:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: to make it ntfs
[11/28/2007 03:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: or use linux raid
[11/28/2007 03:35:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-P
[11/28/2007 03:35:48 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[11/28/2007 03:35:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's better
[11/28/2007 03:36:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: except they haven't even released a stable version
[11/28/2007 03:36:38 PM] Robert Douglas: my onboard nvidia raid seems to be oretty good
[11/28/2007 03:36:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i just had a hard drive die on me
[11/28/2007 03:37:16 PM] Robert Douglas: so i need to format the new drive using ntfs first, then i'll put it back into the array and rebuild it
[11/28/2007 03:37:46 PM] Robert Douglas: WD was out of the 74gb raptors, so they were going to send out an 80gb instead
[11/28/2007 03:38:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: use a recovery disk to format the new drive using fdisk, then use the fat32 to ntfs converter
[11/28/2007 03:39:02 PM] Robert Douglas: u should be able to do it without having to use a converter
[11/28/2007 03:39:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/OS/Windows/Tools/Recovery%20Console.iso)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/OS/Windows/Tools/Recovery%20Console.iso
[11/28/2007 03:39:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: fdisk only supports fat 16 and fat 32
[11/28/2007 03:39:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: its because of microsofts fuckin legacy code
[11/28/2007 03:39:50 PM] Robert Douglas: but i think u can use the FORMAT command from msdos
[11/28/2007 03:40:11 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.computerhope.com/formathl.htm)http://www.computerhope.com/formathl.htm
[11/28/2007 03:40:23 PM] Robert Douglas: FORMAT C: /FS:NTFS
[11/28/2007 03:41:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: if the drive isn't in use you can do it in windows
[11/28/2007 03:41:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: use the volume manager
[11/28/2007 03:41:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: in control panel
[11/28/2007 03:41:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant boot since array is down
[11/28/2007 03:42:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: then use the link i sent you
[11/28/2007 03:42:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't that solve your problem?
[11/28/2007 03:43:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand what the problem is
[11/28/2007 03:43:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, but it takes a lot more steps
[11/28/2007 03:44:06 PM] Robert Douglas: i can just use FORMAT C: /NS:NTFS
[11/28/2007 03:44:13 PM] Robert Douglas: via a boot disk
[11/28/2007 03:44:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok if you think that will work then do that

[12/10/2007 01:50:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it's kind of an amusing idea, we are going to take a picture of salt and pepper and napkins and put it on the monitor normally
[12/10/2007 01:50:49 PM] Robert Douglas: going to be around the 19th/20th, for a 3 day trip
[12/10/2007 01:51:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we are going to take a picture of just the table and put like a thanksgiving feast on the picture
[12/10/2007 01:51:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i looks like a mirror into an alternate dimension with better food
[12/10/2007 01:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool, i am leaving for ohio the 19th

[12/11/2007 04:57:40 PM] Robert Douglas: u need the floppy in order to dodrivers

[12/11/2007 04:58:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i like it
[12/11/2007 04:58:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho my excellent idea
[12/11/2007 04:58:34 PM] Robert Douglas: it worked great when one of my drives failed
[12/11/2007 04:58:36 PM] Robert Douglas: yea, whats the idea
[12/11/2007 04:58:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: your post just made me think of it
[12/11/2007 04:58:48 PM] Robert Douglas: great, i take 50% credit then
[12/11/2007 04:58:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: rendering the color and pages in different formats
[12/11/2007 04:59:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know there is a php -> pdf format
[12/11/2007 04:59:09 PM] Robert Douglas: for code paster?
[12/11/2007 04:59:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we could use image magic to make images
[12/11/2007 04:59:26 PM] Robert Douglas: why would u make anything into images?
[12/11/2007 04:59:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: for people to link directly to code rendered in a specified format
[12/11/2007 04:59:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know when people show their computer stats in their signature
[12/11/2007 04:59:56 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah..
[12/11/2007 05:00:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i like the idea of a color coded page
[12/11/2007 05:00:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would just be a nice feature for putting code on other pages
[12/11/2007 05:00:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: to have it in an image
[12/11/2007 05:00:30 PM] Robert Douglas: ohhh
[12/11/2007 05:00:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i get u now
[12/11/2007 05:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would still use all the color rendering engine
[12/11/2007 05:00:43 PM] Robert Douglas: so if u wanted to paste code on a forum or something
[12/11/2007 05:00:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i just use code paster
[12/11/2007 05:00:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it would be accessible in different formats
[12/11/2007 05:00:54 PM] Robert Douglas: it draws up an image
[12/11/2007 05:00:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: for like printing out PDFs
[12/11/2007 05:01:01 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[12/11/2007 05:01:04 PM] Robert Douglas: that's hot
[12/11/2007 05:01:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but they would be able to access offline
[12/11/2007 05:01:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the important thing
[12/11/2007 05:01:20 PM] Robert Douglas: u can have a "save code pasteas"
[12/11/2007 05:01:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[12/11/2007 05:01:43 PM] Robert Douglas: certain types, like "text" can be saved into a word doc file, .txt file, image file, or pdf file
[12/11/2007 05:01:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is plenty of room for a save link next to the font size
[12/11/2007 05:02:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: like how we have printable now
[12/11/2007 05:02:10 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[12/11/2007 05:02:13 PM] Robert Douglas: oh, i found a bug
[12/11/2007 05:02:20 PM] Robert Douglas: "Collapse" should not display, unless it needs to
[12/11/2007 05:02:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we could add extra things to the PDF files like a Code Paster logo
[12/11/2007 05:02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: see what happens when u hit "collapse" (Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4739)http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4739
[12/11/2007 05:02:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not a bug
[12/11/2007 05:02:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: its actually a mode
[12/11/2007 05:03:09 PM] Robert Douglas: scroll down
[12/11/2007 05:03:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should be changed to "Show Scroll Bars" or something
[12/11/2007 05:03:12 PM] Robert Douglas: you'll see the bug
[12/11/2007 05:03:30 PM] Robert Douglas: hit "colaplse" then scroll
[12/11/2007 05:03:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i realize that
[12/11/2007 05:03:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i know u can add images to PDF files, but dunno if there is support to do it for word docs
[12/11/2007 05:03:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will work on it over winter break
[12/11/2007 05:04:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: forward that domain to my ip address?
[12/11/2007 05:04:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: that might actually get pushed off to summer project, because code paster has so much more potential

[12/19/2007 08:22:30 PM] Robert Douglas: u can do an output of pure html only, no css
[12/19/2007 08:22:35 PM] Robert Douglas: so someone can copy/paste everything
[12/19/2007 08:22:44 PM] Robert Douglas: and it will apply a color style to every letter
[12/19/2007 08:27:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is the point of applying a color to every letter?
[12/19/2007 08:28:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i see
[12/19/2007 08:28:09 PM] Robert Douglas: so people can more easily insert html output into their web page
[12/19/2007 08:28:17 PM] Robert Douglas: without having to worry about applying a css style

[01/14/2008 10:59:01 PM] Robert Douglas: y0
[01/14/2008 10:59:10 PM] Robert Douglas: got a php question
[01/14/2008 10:59:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: was up?
[01/14/2008 10:59:26 PM] Robert Douglas: actually more like mysql
[01/14/2008 10:59:43 PM] Robert Douglas: is there a word
[01/14/2008 10:59:45 PM] Robert Douglas: for mysql
[01/14/2008 10:59:51 PM] Robert Douglas: that i can put after the limit
[01/14/2008 10:59:57 PM] Robert Douglas: that says there is no limit?
[01/14/2008 11:00:07 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, equal to the affect of NOT including the syntax with the word limit
[01/14/2008 11:00:13 PM] Robert Douglas: for example
[01/14/2008 11:00:14 PM] Robert Douglas: $result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tblannouncements WHERE published='on' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT ".$limit);
[01/14/2008 11:00:21 PM] Robert Douglas: user defines $limit
[01/14/2008 11:00:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but if they want it to be unlimited results, they should be able to say nolimit
[01/14/2008 11:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[01/14/2008 11:00:47 PM] Robert Douglas: like
[01/14/2008 11:00:49 PM] Robert Douglas: LIMIT no
[01/14/2008 11:00:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you need to set a case for no limit
[01/14/2008 11:01:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: to exclude it
[01/14/2008 11:01:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: limit only takes to starts position and length parameters
[01/14/2008 11:01:42 PM] Robert Douglas: well there is no case for no limit really
[01/14/2008 11:01:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if there is no limit then exclude limit from the statement
[01/14/2008 11:01:49 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[01/14/2008 11:03:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what is the problem then?
[01/14/2008 11:04:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: make a new if statment
[01/14/2008 11:04:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: php is efficient
[01/14/2008 11:04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: just an extra statement
[01/14/2008 11:04:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[01/14/2008 11:05:45 PM] Robert Douglas: u ever get php4 to work with RSS feeds?
[01/14/2008 11:06:06 PM] Robert Douglas: php5 has some sexy syntax for RSS/XML
[01/14/2008 11:06:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm? RSS is just standardized XML, piece of cakes to do with a template system
[01/14/2008 11:06:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i can't find any decent php4 tutorials
[01/14/2008 11:06:40 PM] Robert Douglas: php5 have a simplexml function
[01/14/2008 11:06:45 PM] Robert Douglas: makes it supereasy
[01/14/2008 11:07:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i learned RSS back when the PSP came out because it supported RSS music
[01/14/2008 11:10:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: RSS is just a type of XML, i shouldn't even be related to PHP
[01/14/2008 11:10:21 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but you can use PHP as a parser to display an RSS feed
[01/14/2008 11:10:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm i haven't looked into that at all
[01/14/2008 11:10:48 PM] Robert Douglas: it's pretty complex
[01/14/2008 11:11:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess if you were doing php4 just look at the xml libraries from PEAR
[01/14/2008 11:11:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: RSS isn't THAT complex
[01/14/2008 11:11:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are only maybe a few dozen elements to parse
[01/14/2008 11:12:03 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i looked at it
[01/14/2008 11:12:06 PM] Robert Douglas: didnt find anything decent
[01/14/2008 11:12:14 PM] Robert Douglas: every place i looked said to use PEAR too
[01/14/2008 11:12:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[01/14/2008 11:12:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: pwnt
[01/14/2008 11:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: pear is awesome
[01/14/2008 11:12:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure they have a RSS library compatible with php4
[01/14/2008 11:13:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RSS)http://pear.php.net/package/XML_RSS

[01/18/2008 10:00:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need another domain name + forwarding
[01/18/2008 10:00:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i guess i owe you some money
[01/18/2008 10:01:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: $26 dollars for 2?
[01/18/2008 10:02:14 AM] Robert Douglas: $15 each
[01/18/2008 10:02:20 AM] Robert Douglas: pricing just went up like 4 months ago
[01/18/2008 10:02:27 AM] Robert Douglas: but i think we're going to keep our same pricing
[01/18/2008 10:02:32 AM] Robert Douglas: we just make less money
[01/18/2008 10:02:50 AM] Robert Douglas: $26 is fine
[01/18/2008 10:03:23 AM] Robert Douglas: did alex send u that check?
[01/18/2008 10:04:11 AM] Robert Douglas: what's the domain name u need
[01/18/2008 10:07:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would really like iicon.com but it looks like it is owned by some domain sales company so i don't know if that would make it harder to acquire
[01/18/2008 10:08:14 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, usually you have to pay a premium fee to get those kind of domains
[01/18/2008 10:08:39 AM] Robert Douglas: iicon.com is probably worth quite a bit of money too
[01/18/2008 10:09:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i was thinking eyeicon or eyecon
[01/18/2008 10:09:28 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: https://www.domainsystems.com/bidform.php?domain=IICON.COM)https://www.domainsystems.com/bidform.php?domain=IICON.COM
[01/18/2008 10:09:47 AM] Robert Douglas: with things like that, people are going to wonder if you mean iicon or eyecon
[01/18/2008 10:09:58 AM] Robert Douglas: eyeicon*
[01/18/2008 10:10:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: which would you suggest?
[01/18/2008 10:10:54 AM] Robert Douglas: not sure, kind of hard to say with this one
[01/18/2008 10:10:58 AM] Robert Douglas: some would think eye icon
[01/18/2008 10:11:02 AM] Robert Douglas: others would think i icon
[01/18/2008 10:11:18 AM] Robert Douglas: everytime you say your domain,you have to take the time to tell them how to type it in
[01/18/2008 10:11:54 AM] Robert Douglas: eyeicon is taken too
[01/18/2008 10:12:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: well maybe something, what the site does is it's a tool for the iphone/ipod to specify the icon for a website bookmark on their desktop
[01/18/2008 10:12:02 AM] Robert Douglas: same with eyecon
[01/18/2008 10:12:50 AM] Robert Douglas: applecon and appleicon taken
[01/18/2008 10:14:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[01/18/2008 10:14:02 AM] Robert Douglas: imarks.com is good
[01/18/2008 10:14:04 AM] Robert Douglas: but that's taken too
[01/18/2008 10:14:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: shit
[01/18/2008 10:14:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: like 90% of any letter combination under 5 letters is taken
[01/18/2008 10:14:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: what about adding dashes somewhere?
[01/18/2008 10:14:54 AM] Robert Douglas: i-marks.com avail
[01/18/2008 10:14:58 AM] Robert Douglas: eait
[01/18/2008 10:14:59 AM] Robert Douglas: npoe
[01/18/2008 10:15:00 AM] Robert Douglas: haha
[01/18/2008 10:15:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[01/18/2008 10:16:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i have another site idea
[01/18/2008 10:16:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: a remote renderer
[01/18/2008 10:16:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: for websites
[01/18/2008 10:16:49 AM] Robert Douglas: like (Link: www.browsercam.com)www.browsercam.com ?
[01/18/2008 10:16:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: so browsers that suck like our treos can proxy to this site and all the pages will be rendered on my server, then sent via google maps style images to the phone
[01/18/2008 10:17:19 AM] Robert Douglas: u ever try to go to google maps on ur treo?
[01/18/2008 10:17:27 AM] Robert Douglas: it is SUPER slow
[01/18/2008 10:17:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's not too bad
[01/18/2008 10:17:38 AM] Robert Douglas: what about flash?
[01/18/2008 10:17:41 AM] Robert Douglas: what about links?
[01/18/2008 10:17:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: our phones can't support flash anyways
[01/18/2008 10:18:12 AM] Robert Douglas: what happens when MS finally releases a browser that works more like the one on the iphone?
[01/18/2008 10:18:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: and for links it will ajax where the mouse is clicked and the server will handle it
[01/18/2008 10:18:41 AM] Robert Douglas: is ajax supported in windows mobile browsers?
[01/18/2008 10:18:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: they might release a better browser but IE still sucks, plus that's not a reason enough to get a new phone
[01/18/2008 10:19:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: and furthermore it's unlikely that it will compete with the iphone's browser because there is not enough internal memory to store an entire engine
[01/18/2008 10:19:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes there is minimum java and ajax support
[01/18/2008 10:20:02 AM] Robert Douglas: sounds like u got a lot of that covered
[01/18/2008 10:20:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i might want a domain for that site, i already have a webbrowser running on command line and spitting out a screen shot
[01/18/2008 10:20:59 AM] Robert Douglas: that's pretty sweet
[01/18/2008 10:21:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: firefox to be exact
[01/18/2008 10:21:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: running on Xvfb (virtual frame buffer)
[01/18/2008 10:21:45 AM] Robert Douglas: i've never messed with any of that stuff before
[01/18/2008 10:21:50 AM] Robert Douglas: it sounds like this could work
[01/18/2008 10:21:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't even need an X server to work
[01/18/2008 10:22:08 AM] Robert Douglas: the biggest problem will be making it eassy for users to know about it, and knowhow to use it
[01/18/2008 10:22:15 AM] Robert Douglas: how would it be implemented on someone's treo?
[01/18/2008 10:22:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i figure if we tone down the image quality a tad, and tranfer the entire image, then we can make the javascript do some really cool stuff
[01/18/2008 10:22:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: like make multiple pages load in the same browser screen and add some fancy effects client side
[01/18/2008 10:23:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: like stuff the iphone does with the pages shifting
[01/18/2008 10:23:16 AM] Robert Douglas: so u would need to install software on someone's treo?
[01/18/2008 10:23:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think it can be as easy as either setting up a proxy, which would make sense because you wouldn't want to load the page through any other server
[01/18/2008 10:24:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: or simple making an initial query for the page, through an address field on my website
[01/18/2008 10:24:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: no custom software needed
[01/18/2008 10:24:40 AM] Robert Douglas: are u planning to sell this service?
[01/18/2008 10:25:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think eventually, but it will be cheap, just enough for me to afford the bandwidth it needs
[01/18/2008 10:25:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: and maybe commercial source?
[01/18/2008 10:25:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: you pay like 20 bucks for the source code you can run it on your own server and get better bandwidth
[01/18/2008 10:25:35 AM] Robert Douglas: well if u plan to restrict user access based on a subscription, user will need to install software
[01/18/2008 10:25:43 AM] Robert Douglas: u should just accept donations instead
[01/18/2008 10:25:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/18/2008 10:25:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: donations and commercial source
[01/18/2008 10:25:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: that would be fine
[01/18/2008 10:26:05 AM] Robert Douglas: i wouldnt show the source
[01/18/2008 10:26:12 AM] Robert Douglas: this is the kind of idea that could sell for big
[01/18/2008 10:26:27 AM] Robert Douglas: implement the idea, wait until u get people who are using it
[01/18/2008 10:26:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: then i guess i should keep working
[01/18/2008 10:26:39 AM] Robert Douglas: then take it to Verizon
[01/18/2008 10:26:43 AM] Robert Douglas: or sprint
[01/18/2008 10:26:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be sweet
[01/18/2008 10:27:09 AM] Robert Douglas: but verizon may just come out with their own browser that does it
[01/18/2008 10:27:17 AM] Robert Douglas: so you have a great idea
[01/18/2008 10:27:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: my main concern is how to manage the sessions on the server side, because i need to keep the pages open in firefox so people can click on them
[01/18/2008 10:27:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: so how do i support multiple pages
[01/18/2008 10:27:51 AM] Robert Douglas: not sure, i dont think u could base it on IP
[01/18/2008 10:28:07 AM] Robert Douglas: i think more than 1 person gets the same IP address
[01/18/2008 10:28:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have already determined that i will have to write a plugin to control the clicking in firefox
[01/18/2008 10:29:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it could also control tabs, so i am thinking of starting a new firefox session for each php session
[01/18/2008 10:29:34 AM] Robert Douglas: that might use up quite a few resources
[01/18/2008 10:29:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that is what i was thinking
[01/18/2008 10:29:53 AM] Robert Douglas: but what happens when FF releases update?
[01/18/2008 10:30:03 AM] Robert Douglas: or when a FF session crashes?
[01/18/2008 10:30:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/18/2008 10:30:28 AM] Robert Douglas: i like the idea, but i think there are better things u could develop that have less risk involved
[01/18/2008 10:30:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: like?
[01/18/2008 10:31:16 AM] Robert Douglas: well if you were familiar with ModernBill
[01/18/2008 10:31:20 AM] Robert Douglas: they could use a shitload of help
[01/18/2008 10:31:34 AM] Robert Douglas: i cant really think of anything right now
[01/18/2008 10:31:52 AM] Robert Douglas: i know the guy doing the (Link: www.phpcalendar.com)www.phpcalendar.com
[01/18/2008 10:32:01 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.easyphpcalendar.com/)http://www.easyphpcalendar.com/
[01/18/2008 10:32:23 AM] Robert Douglas: is making quite a bit
[01/18/2008 10:32:34 AM] Robert Douglas: stuff like that is useful
[01/18/2008 10:32:40 AM] Robert Douglas: but takes a lot of time/energy for development
[01/18/2008 10:33:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol every heard of google calendar?
[01/18/2008 10:33:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: my idea is original and never been done before
[01/18/2008 10:33:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: sure there are a few bugs and risks but i think they can be worked through with a little bit of thought
[01/18/2008 10:35:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: for example, it wouldn't be that hard for me to just create a link map on the image for every mousedown event then actually fire that event on client side when it is clicked on the images
[01/18/2008 10:36:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: so there are a few tradeoffs like the mousedown event would change the appearance of anything when fired, but the browser isn't really even useable now anyways
[01/18/2008 10:36:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: so everything i do, is an improvement
[01/18/2008 10:36:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is an idea worth pursuing 
[01/18/2008 10:42:42 AM] Robert Douglas: well the idea does make sense
[01/18/2008 10:42:45 AM] Robert Douglas: and it would solvea problem

[02/05/2008 10:32:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the relationship between php and a template system
[02/05/2008 10:32:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's pretty easy
[02/05/2008 10:32:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm trying to do the equivalent of: 
<? $some_var_that_file_needs = "hello"; include("file.php"); ?>
[02/05/2008 10:33:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: no idea
[02/05/2008 10:33:17 PM] Robert Douglas: file.php uses $some_var 
[02/05/2008 10:33:17 PM] Robert Douglas: but from what I have seen, is ASP includes the files beftore it would set the variable $some_var_that_file_needs

[02/06/2008 12:42:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean this summer
[02/06/2008 12:42:27 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe this summer we could do something like that
[02/06/2008 12:42:29 AM] Robert Douglas: would be interesting
[02/06/2008 12:42:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: palm OS and open office would be fuckin easy too

[02/06/2008 12:43:16 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[02/06/2008 12:43:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but this whole thing uses standardized XML
[02/06/2008 12:43:25 AM] Robert Douglas: maybe in th esummer if i have time i can do something like that
[02/06/2008 12:43:33 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, XML is the way to go for sure
[02/06/2008 12:43:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the ODF is freely available

[02/06/2008 12:44:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably why their software acts kind of gay
[02/06/2008 12:44:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: the outlook plugin sucks
[02/06/2008 12:45:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is object based instead of content based
[02/06/2008 12:45:47 AM] Robert Douglas: still need to learn the code behind it
[02/06/2008 12:46:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: for example if you have a contact, and you delete it, then it deletes it from the server, all dandy, but say you add a phone number to your phone, and the contact already exists on your desktop, then instead of merging the information, it creates a new contact with exactly the same name but different information
[02/06/2008 12:46:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: when outlook already has dialogs for handling that stuff
[02/06/2008 12:46:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's pretty gay
[02/06/2008 12:47:50 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[02/06/2008 12:47:52 AM] Robert Douglas: i HATE that shit

[02/06/2008 12:48:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: sync software does it all the fucking time
[02/06/2008 12:48:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: when will these people learn that it is the 21st century, and the extra overhead for content syncing as opposed to object syncing is entirely worth it
[02/06/2008 12:50:47 AM] Robert Douglas: i agree that more thought should be put into it
[02/06/2008 12:50:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: syncML has the potential to be the basis of GTD yet it is so underused
[02/06/2008 12:50:51 AM] Robert Douglas: it is like they had a monkey program it lol
[02/06/2008 12:58:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: fuck it i am writing my own syncml shit for XML class
[02/06/2008 12:58:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: funambol has like 10 broken links on their site
[02/06/2008 12:58:44 AM] Robert Douglas: u shoulod just go start one of those projects
[02/06/2008 12:58:49 AM] Robert Douglas: lmao
[02/06/2008 12:58:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: which means it's not being maintained

[02/17/2008 03:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses a post function of curl
[02/17/2008 03:02:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: should get your started
[02/17/2008 03:02:31 PM] Robert Douglas: but does it display the contents of the page, or does it actually redirect to that page?
[02/17/2008 03:02:38 PM] Robert Douglas: <?php 
$url = "http://" . $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] . ":" . $port . "/login/";

curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL,$url);

curl_exe
[02/17/2008 03:02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what I already have, but it doesn't redirect to the new page, it keeps u on the curl page
[02/17/2008 03:03:46 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt look like the code u posted will actually redirect to the page, i think it stays on the curl page

[03/13/2008 11:32:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i thought this might be a great opportunity to research a system for hosting the same content on multiple servers, and communicating between the two
[03/13/2008 11:33:14 PM] Robert Douglas: like rsync?
[03/13/2008 11:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i had this idea, just for testing purposes we could set up a script to sync our servers, just 1 website, actually a blog, and play with some DNS options to make it forward to different servers
[03/13/2008 11:35:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: one thing to work out in particular is how to transfer sessions between the servers, because if 1 server gives out a page, the other servers have to know that
[03/13/2008 11:35:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: just thought it would be cool to try out
[03/13/2008 11:35:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to go get drunk now

[04/23/2008 11:10:32 PM] Robert Douglas: can a MB with 1333 FSB work with CPU with 1066 FSB?
[04/23/2008 11:46:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would say no
[04/23/2008 11:46:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would have to assume the fsb can go down, but it can't clock up
[04/23/2008 11:47:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wait
[04/23/2008 11:47:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that doesn't make sense
[04/23/2008 11:47:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should be able to clock the mb down to 1066
[04/23/2008 11:47:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but they may be too far apart
[04/23/2008 11:52:18 PM] Robert Douglas: cpu is 1333
[04/23/2008 11:52:20 PM] Robert Douglas: mb is 1066
[04/23/2008 11:52:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah not sure the mb can convert up
[04/23/2008 11:52:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and you can't make the cpu clock down
[04/23/2008 11:53:19 PM] Robert Douglas: some ppl saying u can sometimes flash bios to do 1333
[04/23/2008 11:53:25 PM] Robert Douglas: just reallly gay lol
[04/23/2008 11:53:31 PM] Robert Douglas: MB says it supports the cpu

[04/27/2008 01:46:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i think the biggest part was the video junk

[04/27/2008 02:18:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: will you register wiseserver.com
[04/27/2008 02:18:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am copying you

[04/27/2008 02:22:55 PM] Robert Douglas: why dont u use that
[04/27/2008 02:22:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the cmstacker is more intuitive with the slots for drives
[04/27/2008 02:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is a little harder to get around because the drive chassis rotates instead of sliding out the front
[04/27/2008 02:23:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have a girl on my bed
[04/27/2008 02:23:56 PM] Robert Douglas: lol

[05/04/2008 06:13:16 PM] Robert Douglas: ur ISP allows that?
[05/04/2008 06:13:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: with virtual aliases, so that i can make a new e-mail address for each website i sign up for, and if i decide i hate them, then i can just remove it and it will block all the e-mails
[05/04/2008 06:14:56 PM] Robert Douglas: very nice
[05/04/2008 06:14:58 PM] Robert Douglas: i do that often

[05/04/2008 07:02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: and see if they want to sell it off
[05/04/2008 07:02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it wilol probably cost a couple hundred
[05/04/2008 07:02:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might do that for tack.com
[05/04/2008 07:03:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i want an e-mail brian@tack.com

[05/09/2008 08:14:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know if it has been cracked to the point of it being useful
[05/09/2008 08:16:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i got a free license
[05/09/2008 08:16:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: then it should be good

[05/10/2008 02:20:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to make wise@bjcullinan.com my primary account
[05/10/2008 02:34:03 PM] Robert Douglas: no
[05/10/2008 02:34:11 PM] Robert Douglas: u could tho setup bjcul to use dynamic dns
[05/10/2008 02:34:18 PM] Robert Douglas: so when yours goes down, it goes to mine
[05/10/2008 02:34:21 PM] Robert Douglas: but that is 3rd party
[05/10/2008 02:34:24 PM] Robert Douglas: and costs  abit
[05/10/2008 02:38:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know there is a way for it to use different servers using dns

[05/12/2008 11:20:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i have been thinking a lot about abstraction
[05/12/2008 11:20:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i finally found a level that i like

[05/12/2008 11:22:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: and moving the type selector
[05/12/2008 11:24:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so basically i am going to have 10 levels of displaying detail, 10 being the most detailed it will have a bunch of ajax stuff and kind of look like a cross between windows media player and itunes, and 1 being the very simply list, something that will work in a text based browser

[05/13/2008 12:03:20 AM] Robert Douglas: ms paint
[05/13/2008 12:03:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not really looking for sexy
[05/13/2008 12:03:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: just functional for now
[05/13/2008 12:03:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you could help me with sexy later
[05/13/2008 12:03:44 AM] Robert Douglas: well think about what the suer wants to do
[05/13/2008 12:03:46 AM] Robert Douglas: know what i mean?
[05/13/2008 12:03:49 AM] Robert Douglas: then go for that
[05/13/2008 12:04:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i am doing mainly back end stuff
[05/13/2008 12:04:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but main features will be useability, and downloading media in multiple formats
[05/13/2008 12:09:58 AM] Robert Douglas: that media server tho is super sexy
[05/13/2008 12:11:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have really been concentrating on the abstraction, figuring out how i can make it functional and expandable
[05/13/2008 12:11:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: trying to make it as modular as possible
[05/13/2008 12:11:34 AM] Robert Douglas: yea that is smart
[05/13/2008 12:11:36 AM] Robert Douglas: good coding
[05/13/2008 12:12:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have come to the conclusion that data should be absolutely separate from how it is viewed
[05/13/2008 12:12:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: so the main loading functionality takes place in the cron job to read the filesystem into a database
[05/13/2008 12:12:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: then the viewing connects the databases and spits it out
[05/13/2008 12:12:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am going to break it now and make a big change
[05/13/2008 12:13:59 AM] Robert Douglas: yup
[05/13/2008 12:14:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i set up this sweet if for the template system

[05/16/2008 05:12:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you select 2, you can see how the template changes

[05/30/2008 03:21:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure i am doing the includes correctly
[05/30/2008 03:21:52 PM] Robert Douglas: for smarty?
[05/30/2008 03:21:55 PM] Robert Douglas: post ur code
[05/30/2008 03:21:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah

[05/30/2008 03:25:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i use line 6 and 19 on every php page
[05/30/2008 03:25:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess my concern is that is will be hard to keep track of assignments made my previous pages
[05/30/2008 03:26:04 PM] Robert Douglas: you can use {debug}
[05/30/2008 03:26:07 PM] Robert Douglas: to see what all the vars are
[05/30/2008 03:26:25 PM] Robert Douglas: so you want to do the title then?
[05/30/2008 03:26:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it has to check all the variables ahead of time because there is some $_request processing that redirects the page
[05/30/2008 03:26:47 PM] Robert Douglas: {include file ='title.tpl' title='Media Server'}
[05/30/2008 03:26:53 PM] Robert Douglas: then uur title.tpl file:
[05/30/2008 03:27:07 PM] Robert Douglas: <title>{$title}</title>
[05/30/2008 03:28:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean do the other includes i use make sense?
[05/30/2008 03:30:16 PM] Robert Douglas: it depends on how you are using them
[05/30/2008 03:30:22 PM] Robert Douglas: you should have your title in an include
[05/30/2008 03:31:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am including all the php pages to make the assignments, then using the template to include the other html pieces
[05/30/2008 03:32:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd have to see what it looks like when you include the content, and then when u just use the smarty include
[05/30/2008 03:32:25 PM] Robert Douglas: without that, i cant really tell u if it is the best implementation or not
[05/30/2008 03:33:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: the problem is the processing of post variables and doing page redirects
[05/30/2008 03:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i guess i could make a plugin to handle all the functionality

[05/30/2008 03:59:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but select detail 2

[05/30/2008 04:00:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i normally just use {debug} i think
[05/30/2008 04:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you try it?

[06/04/2008 06:14:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i have lots of whitespace around my smarty logic stuff in the page, and when it is parsed it shows all the whitespace in the code, is there a way for me to mark it so it doesn't include the whitespace
[06/04/2008 06:14:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[06/04/2008 06:15:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it is messing up the way it displays
[06/04/2008 06:15:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i view the page in firefox
[06/04/2008 06:15:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it inserts like lines and spaces
[06/04/2008 06:15:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though html is suppose to remove it
[06/04/2008 06:47:02 PM] Robert Douglas: hummm

[06/04/2008 06:49:57 PM] Robert Douglas: best thing to do is group everything together, and then make some shitty pohotoshop thing
[06/04/2008 06:50:00 PM] Robert Douglas: then send it to me
[06/04/2008 06:50:05 PM] Robert Douglas: and i'll remake it using your layout

[06/05/2008 01:12:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: it loads pretty quick for me
[06/05/2008 01:14:02 AM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[06/05/2008 01:14:04 AM] Robert Douglas: it looks hot though
[06/05/2008 01:14:14 AM] Robert Douglas: you should break up your media server
[06/05/2008 01:14:17 AM] Robert Douglas: into multiple programs
[06/05/2008 01:14:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i plan to

[06/05/2008 01:15:03 AM] Robert Douglas: sweet
[06/05/2008 01:15:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i think i will start with the file view just like windows explorer
[06/05/2008 01:15:57 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[06/05/2008 01:16:04 AM] Robert Douglas: and then add a checkbox
[06/05/2008 01:16:07 AM] Robert Douglas: so u can add it to playlist
[06/05/2008 01:16:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that will contain the search functionality
[06/05/2008 01:16:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will just make a "Music Options" like when you select songs in explorer
[06/05/2008 01:16:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it will send it to the playlist manage
[06/05/2008 01:16:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: r

[06/05/2008 01:19:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: implementing all the functionality that i have in the current ugly format is top priority
[06/05/2008 01:20:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: then polishing the file viewer
[06/05/2008 01:20:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i can't call it Explorer
[06/05/2008 01:20:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: or Finder
[06/05/2008 01:21:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: or Kwhatever
[06/05/2008 01:21:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: how about Portal
[06/05/2008 01:21:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is a portal into the files
[06/05/2008 01:22:22 AM] Robert Douglas: keep it as a windows based desktop

[06/22/2008 07:43:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i can read ur htaccess files
[06/22/2008 07:45:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats ok, nothing important
[06/22/2008 07:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will go through and delete them from the database
[06/22/2008 07:45:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and add some code to skip all of those when loading files
[06/22/2008 07:45:51 PM] Robert Douglas: u have to store all of the file names/locations in a db?
[06/22/2008 07:46:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/22/2008 07:46:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: and filesize and some other info
[06/22/2008 07:46:23 PM] Robert Douglas: how come it cant read the file system?
[06/22/2008 07:46:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it cant read the mp3 tags?
[06/22/2008 07:46:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: the db is a like a cache
[06/22/2008 07:46:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it doesn;t have to read it from the disk every time
[06/22/2008 07:47:00 PM] Robert Douglas: humm
[06/22/2008 07:47:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: stuff like the mp3 tags are costly
[06/22/2008 07:47:03 PM] Robert Douglas: that's prolly smart then
[06/22/2008 07:47:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: it still reads it from the firle
[06/22/2008 07:47:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: *file
[06/22/2008 07:47:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it only does it ones
[06/22/2008 07:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: *once
[06/22/2008 07:47:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it makes it really quick to do searches!!!1
[06/22/2008 07:47:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: trying to search a file system every time is also really costly
[06/22/2008 07:47:55 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, u did smart job
[06/22/2008 07:48:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can literally just delete any part of the DB and it will rebuild it
[06/22/2008 07:48:08 PM] Robert Douglas: very sexy
[06/22/2008 07:48:11 PM] Robert Douglas: mysql?
[06/22/2008 07:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/22/2008 07:48:28 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant wait for u to implement an mp3 plauyer
[06/22/2008 07:48:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could go through and delete all the artists that start with A, and it will rebuild it the next time cron is run
[06/22/2008 07:48:31 PM] Robert Douglas: like a windows media playuer
[06/22/2008 07:48:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it will be hot
[06/22/2008 07:48:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will have all the capabilities of vlc!
[06/22/2008 07:49:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but a windows media player like interface
[06/22/2008 07:49:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is next
[06/22/2008 07:49:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: need to implement list and detail view, then i am done with portal
[06/22/2008 07:49:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: can vlc transcode flv?
[06/22/2008 07:49:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be amazing
[06/22/2008 07:50:03 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno about vlc
[06/22/2008 07:50:21 PM] Robert Douglas: u should try to set it up so you can see the cd cover
[06/22/2008 07:50:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i could give them a choice to render in wmp, quicktime, or flash plugin
[06/22/2008 07:50:32 PM] Robert Douglas: remember looking at that
[06/22/2008 07:50:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally

[06/22/2008 07:51:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: or just a flash player that can only stream 1 content type like mpg, then i can just transcode everything to mpg
[06/22/2008 08:06:39 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure the best way to handle it
[06/22/2008 08:06:57 PM] Robert Douglas: at the bottom of the Portal window
[06/22/2008 08:06:59 PM] Robert Douglas: u should say
[06/22/2008 08:07:18 PM] Robert Douglas: "Video: 4 Songs: 23 Folders: 2"
[06/22/2008 08:07:33 PM] Robert Douglas: Video: 4. Songs: 23. Folders: 2.
[06/22/2008 10:04:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you mean just list the totals?

[08/12/2008 04:48:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they ruined the site completely
[08/12/2008 04:48:19 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as ur building it for a select audience
[08/12/2008 04:48:24 PM] Robert Douglas: then that is ok
[08/12/2008 04:48:28 PM] Robert Douglas: but i think u want to make it for everyone
[08/12/2008 04:48:30 PM] Robert Douglas: so it isnt limited

[08/12/2008 04:50:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will make an option for selecting the player
[08/12/2008 04:50:52 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/12/2008 04:50:59 PM] Robert Douglas: and say "for best experience please install vlc"
[08/12/2008 04:51:07 PM] Robert Douglas: u can have it auto detect
[08/12/2008 04:51:09 PM] Robert Douglas: if vlc installed
[08/12/2008 04:51:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you will only get to play dvd images with the vlc plugin
[08/12/2008 04:51:12 PM] Robert Douglas: then play using that
[08/12/2008 04:51:24 PM] Robert Douglas: if not installed, then prompt (and remember answer), and do non vlc playback

[08/12/2008 07:30:40 PM] Robert Douglas: it*
[08/12/2008 07:30:48 PM] Robert Douglas: ur javascript is much much better than mine
[08/12/2008 07:35:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: well for one when you define window.onload= initializefooter(); that should be window.onload= initializefooter;
[08/12/2008 07:36:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: because initializefooter becomes a variable that is set to a functional object
[08/12/2008 07:36:21 PM] Robert Douglas: but initialize footer is a function
[08/12/2008 07:36:22 PM] Robert Douglas: thus ()
[08/12/2008 07:36:23 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[08/12/2008 07:36:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when you add () you are basically calling initializefooter() and setting the onload even to the return of that function
[08/12/2008 07:36:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is why it is called before it is finished loading
[08/12/2008 07:37:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and at that point mbfooter object doesn't exist
[08/12/2008 07:37:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so remove the ()
[08/12/2008 07:37:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you should be golden
[08/12/2008 07:37:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes you are setting it to the function without the ()
[08/12/2008 07:37:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you include the () then it is calling the function and setting the onload event to the return of the function
[08/12/2008 07:38:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: peace out
[08/12/2008 07:38:37 PM] Robert Douglas: thx man ill try that

[08/13/2008 06:21:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: now the folder view allows you to select columns based on maximum available information, so folders that only have data files will only have the standard columns available, and folders that have mp3s will have the extra mp3 information available
[08/13/2008 06:22:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: in Details view of course

[09/23/2008 12:17:39 AM] Robert Douglas: 8-)
[09/23/2008 12:17:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it was really recursive, that is where the overflow is coming from
[09/23/2008 12:17:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is why it isn't posting anything
[09/23/2008 12:17:55 AM] Robert Douglas: do u know anyone with a boxed art membership
[09/23/2008 12:17:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: clear the users table?
[09/23/2008 12:18:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: could be users table
[09/23/2008 12:18:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this time we will rewrite it and base it entirely off a forum
[09/23/2008 12:18:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and add the code coloring and javascript effects to forum posts
[09/23/2008 12:18:57 AM] Robert Douglas: lol
[09/23/2008 12:19:02 AM] Robert Douglas: definitely wasnt the user table

[09/23/2008 12:19:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well somewhere it is overflowing that would cause the no info
[09/23/2008 12:19:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hahaha
[09/23/2008 12:20:58 AM] Robert Douglas: do u know what needs to display in the users table

[09/23/2008 12:02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my girlfriend asked me why i used Dreamweaver, instead of a more professional IDE like Visual Studio
[09/23/2008 12:02:41 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[09/23/2008 12:02:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Is there a better IDE?
[09/23/2008 12:02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: after u smacked her what happened next
[09/23/2008 12:02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: no

[09/23/2008 12:03:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean the file management is great, i've tried developing php in eclipse and it was miserable.
[09/23/2008 12:03:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and there is some IDE that is specifically for PHP development
[09/23/2008 12:03:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i never liked it
[09/23/2008 12:04:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I do love visual studio, but all the php extensions are costly
[09/23/2008 12:04:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I am thinking about getting another 24" monitor
[09/23/2008 12:05:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i would have 2 24" kind of centered on my desk, a 20" with same vertical res
[09/23/2008 12:05:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I would need 2 more arm stands too
[09/23/2008 12:06:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that thing is amazingly strong, and it takes up so much less space it makes my desk incredibly easy to clean
[09/23/2008 12:06:12 PM] Robert Douglas: the 20 and 22 are best price for value right now
[09/23/2008 12:06:16 PM] Robert Douglas: 24s are just too expensive
[09/23/2008 12:06:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: agreed
[09/23/2008 12:06:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i already have a 24, and i want the 1920x1200 res

[09/23/2008 12:08:28 PM] Robert Douglas: not a high quality monitor tho
[09/23/2008 12:08:47 PM] Robert Douglas: for another $50 you can get 2 22" monitors lol
[09/23/2008 12:08:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it's acer like my other one
[09/23/2008 12:08:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that are nice monitors
[09/23/2008 12:09:04 PM] Robert Douglas: would u rather have 1 24" or 2 22"?

[09/23/2008 12:12:24 PM] Robert Douglas: and it lines up nicely
[09/23/2008 12:14:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm, but maybe 2 24 inch widescreens would be nicer
[09/23/2008 12:15:05 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno man
[09/23/2008 12:15:31 PM] Robert Douglas: do u want 48" or do u want 68"

[10/07/2008 11:55:55 AM] Robert Douglas: how doews a proxy remove something on a phone
[10/07/2008 11:56:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need a domain to rewrite every path into a get var and get that page
[10/07/2008 11:56:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i direct my cell phone to a page, enter an address, and from then on it goes through my site
[10/07/2008 11:57:17 AM] Robert Douglas: what's the point
[10/07/2008 11:57:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it can remove banner adds and images and css formatting
[10/07/2008 11:58:09 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am also going to use in my media server site, to provide a general proxy to get around throttling and websense
[10/07/2008 11:59:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i use curl to download everything, then parse some stuff to make it only go through my site, then output
[10/07/2008 11:59:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i need a domain to simplify the rewrites

[10/07/2008 12:05:10 PM] Robert Douglas: if u need something to remove banners, why not install an ad blocker or something like that instead?
[10/07/2008 12:05:18 PM] Robert Douglas: seems like a ton of time being spent on something that is already taken care of
[10/07/2008 12:07:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: on my cell phone?  it's actually a pretty simple curl script.  i just have to submit all the post and get variables that were sent through the globals and put them into curl, it is really just copying and pasting everything from the browser, but then fancy stuff can be done with the parser on the return information
[10/07/2008 12:09:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i actually need it for a 3rd project, that is what brought it up
[10/07/2008 12:10:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am trying to write a script that will download nzb files
[10/07/2008 12:10:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and search newzbin also
[10/07/2008 12:10:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so start the downloads automatically
[10/07/2008 12:10:53 PM] Robert Douglas: never dealt with nzb before
[10/07/2008 12:10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: curl does rock
[10/07/2008 12:11:02 PM] Robert Douglas: it is hard to figure out what is an ad and what isnt
[10/07/2008 12:11:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i would chekc out the source code for some of those adblocker scripts and see if u can figur eout some of their logic
[10/07/2008 12:11:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah but you know ad block plus uses a repository?
[10/07/2008 12:11:29 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what i figured
[10/07/2008 12:11:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so people submit links to ads
[10/07/2008 12:11:33 PM] Robert Douglas: it has a list of bad ads
[10/07/2008 12:11:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yea ad domains
[10/07/2008 12:11:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i figure i can just download the repo, and read in that
[10/07/2008 12:11:52 PM] Robert Douglas: uses that, and i think it also uses regex too
[10/07/2008 12:12:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i gtg finish this hw assisgnment
[10/07/2008 12:12:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i need a domain
[10/07/2008 12:13:59 PM] Robert Douglas: u can just use a sub domain of ur bjcul one
[10/07/2008 12:14:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i can make a dns entry so it points that to ur server
[10/07/2008 12:14:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: awesome, would you do just proxy.bjcullinan.com?
[10/07/2008 12:14:44 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[10/07/2008 12:14:46 PM] Robert Douglas: we could do that
[10/07/2008 12:15:06 PM] Robert Douglas: can it wait a couple hours

[10/18/2008 07:41:37 PM] Robert Douglas: all raptor speed
[10/18/2008 07:41:42 PM] Robert Douglas: now THAT is fucking sexy
[10/18/2008 07:41:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[10/18/2008 07:41:54 PM] Robert Douglas: expensive though
[10/18/2008 07:41:59 PM] Robert Douglas: about $1k for the 4 drives
[10/18/2008 07:42:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am just looking for cheap storage though
[10/18/2008 07:42:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want to just do a raid 1 for my important files
[10/18/2008 07:42:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i will have 4x250 free
[10/18/2008 07:42:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably just put downloaded junk in raid 0 on them
[10/18/2008 07:43:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: raid 0 can do 4 drives right?
[10/18/2008 07:43:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i think so
[10/18/2008 07:43:37 PM] Robert Douglas: but raid 0, means all your data is lost, if just 1 drive dies
[10/18/2008 07:43:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah so i would have a 1TB download directory
[10/18/2008 07:43:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would move the important stuff over later
[10/18/2008 07:44:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just need something for tv shows and un organized music and shitty pre release movies
[10/18/2008 07:44:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or new versions of software and operating systems before i replace their previous images in my software archive
[10/18/2008 07:45:09 PM] Robert Douglas: well if u are just doing a bunch of big files that u wont access all the time, raid 0 isnt worth it
[10/18/2008 07:45:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have 2x500 gb dvd drives that i can wipe and add new stuff to, and a 500 gb porn drive that i am thinking about wiping
[10/18/2008 07:45:16 PM] Robert Douglas: raid 0 is best for your OS drive
[10/18/2008 07:45:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will be changing a lot
[10/18/2008 07:45:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will download stuff and delete it and download new stuff
[10/18/2008 07:46:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or i could put it in a raid 5 and make it my media server drive for dvr stuff
[10/18/2008 07:46:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way i want mirrored 1TB drives for my important files
[10/18/2008 07:46:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like music/pictures/documents
[10/18/2008 07:46:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: game images
[10/18/2008 07:46:56 PM] Robert Douglas: raid 0 wont mirror it
[10/18/2008 07:47:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know
[10/18/2008 07:47:04 PM] Robert Douglas: raid 5 is best
[10/18/2008 07:47:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: neg
[10/18/2008 07:47:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: raid 1 is the best
[10/18/2008 07:47:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: raid 5 fails while rebuilding
[10/18/2008 07:47:58 PM] Robert Douglas: raid 1 can fail when rebuilding too
[10/18/2008 07:48:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[10/18/2008 07:48:22 PM] Robert Douglas: raid 5 is just better because it allows yout o stay running while it rebuilds the last drive
[10/18/2008 07:48:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anyways, i already have more storage then you so w/e
[10/18/2008 07:48:28 PM] Robert Douglas: lol bastard
[10/18/2008 07:48:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's whats important
[10/18/2008 07:48:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got a server rack
[10/18/2008 07:49:06 PM] Robert Douglas: do you stil have that case and video card i sent u
[10/18/2008 07:49:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to order 4U cases and convert my server and desktop and media server and ubuntu box all to rack mounted stuff
[10/18/2008 07:49:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: still have the case
[10/18/2008 07:49:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: want it back?
[10/18/2008 07:49:33 PM] Robert Douglas: if u arent really using it, yes
[10/18/2008 07:49:48 PM] Robert Douglas: lkikewise with the video card
[10/18/2008 07:49:53 PM] Robert Douglas: but if u need it, keep it
[10/18/2008 07:50:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think i am using the video card
[10/18/2008 07:50:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[10/18/2008 07:50:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i may have sold it to someone
[10/18/2008 07:50:20 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[10/18/2008 07:50:25 PM] Robert Douglas: it is a solid video card
[10/18/2008 07:50:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i used it for a while
[10/18/2008 07:50:36 PM] Robert Douglas: wasnt it like an x1800xt or something like that?
[10/18/2008 07:50:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i got a sapphire x1800
[10/18/2008 07:50:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nah it was a geforce
[10/18/2008 07:50:52 PM] Robert Douglas: it was around $400 when i bought it
[10/18/2008 07:50:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 7800gt
[10/18/2008 07:51:04 PM] Robert Douglas: i sent u the sapphire
[10/18/2008 07:51:09 PM] Robert Douglas: the x1800
[10/18/2008 07:51:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really?
[10/18/2008 07:51:11 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[10/18/2008 07:51:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[10/18/2008 07:51:14 PM] Robert Douglas: the big red one
[10/18/2008 07:51:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well i am still using it
[10/18/2008 07:51:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i sold the geforce
[10/18/2008 07:51:28 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that sapphire is a badass card
[10/18/2008 07:51:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that i don't know where it came from
[10/18/2008 07:51:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the sapphire is fucking awesome
[10/18/2008 07:51:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: still doesn't play crysis on full settings though
[10/18/2008 07:52:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it breezes through doom 4 and quake 4 and et-qw
[10/18/2008 07:52:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *doom 3
[10/18/2008 07:52:32 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as u using it, keep it
[10/18/2008 07:52:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can bring the case to you, i might be coming down next weekend
[10/18/2008 07:53:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you could always come up and visit
[10/18/2008 07:53:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did i tell you i got usenets?
[10/18/2008 07:53:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got an account with giganewz
[10/18/2008 07:53:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it's like max bandwidth download of anything i could possibly imagine
[10/18/2008 07:54:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't even use it enough though because i don't know what to download
[10/18/2008 07:58:14 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[10/18/2008 07:58:15 PM] Robert Douglas: what is usenets
[10/18/2008 07:58:26 PM] Robert Douglas: if i come up to flag, it will be on my bike

[10/18/2008 08:00:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: usenets are amazing
[10/18/2008 08:01:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: basically they are used for news, and completely legal, like googe news, or cox has one too
[10/18/2008 08:01:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but people upload binary files
[10/18/2008 08:01:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and giganewz keeps the articles up for like 270 days now

[10/18/2008 08:04:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and uses port 80
[10/18/2008 08:04:56 PM] Robert Douglas: is it over ssl?
[10/18/2008 08:05:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can get it over ssl for an extra price
[10/18/2008 08:05:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and you get 5 additional connections
[10/18/2008 08:05:57 PM] Robert Douglas: nice

[10/22/2008 04:56:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's what i get when i try to change the name server on rp-s site
[10/22/2008 04:57:02 PM] Robert Douglas: one sec
[10/22/2008 04:57:02 PM] Robert Douglas: on phone
[10/22/2008 05:04:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: weird
[10/22/2008 05:04:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have to have a subdomain for the name server
[10/22/2008 05:04:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[10/22/2008 05:04:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can't i just set my name server to bjcullinan.com
[10/22/2008 05:04:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[10/22/2008 05:04:34 PM] Robert Douglas: dont think so
[10/22/2008 05:04:42 PM] Robert Douglas: i think is is nsX.domain.com
[10/22/2008 05:04:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then what do i set my bjcullinan.com name server to?
[10/22/2008 05:05:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never setup a dns server before
[10/22/2008 05:05:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: don't i need special dns settings for the ns1 part?
[10/22/2008 05:05:29 PM] Robert Douglas: i think it just goes off of the IP address
[10/22/2008 05:05:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: weird
[10/22/2008 05:06:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so the registry says it changed already
[10/22/2008 05:06:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: since i can still get to my server does that mean it worked?
[10/22/2008 05:10:33 PM] Robert Douglas: no, it can take a couple hours for the change to go in effect
[10/22/2008 05:10:47 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.mob.net/~ted/tools/dns.php3)http://www.mob.net/~ted/tools/dns.php3
[10/22/2008 05:10:50 PM] Robert Douglas: use that
[10/22/2008 05:10:53 PM] Robert Douglas: to see
[10/22/2008 05:10:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the registry already says it changed
[10/22/2008 05:15:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Lookup failed. This does not resolve at this nameserver.
[10/22/2008 05:15:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: every dns server says that
[10/22/2008 05:15:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm not sure, cna u verify your dns server is good?
[10/22/2008 05:16:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know how
[10/22/2008 05:16:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is running
[10/22/2008 05:16:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i don't understand the settings
[10/22/2008 05:16:39 PM] Robert Douglas: i jhave no idea how to configure a dns server
[10/22/2008 05:16:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will ask other cs people around
[10/22/2008 05:17:39 PM] Robert Douglas: might want to look more into networking majors
[10/22/2008 05:17:41 PM] Robert Douglas: rather than cs
[10/22/2008 05:21:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think we have a networking major
[10/22/2008 05:21:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean i know people that have specialized in sysadmin
[10/22/2008 05:22:21 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[10/22/2008 05:22:27 PM] Robert Douglas: probably want to ask them
[10/22/2008 05:59:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if nslookup fails does that mean the name server hasn't propagated yet or something is wrong?
[10/22/2008 06:00:01 PM] Robert Douglas: could be that propagation hasnt taken place
[10/22/2008 06:00:04 PM] Robert Douglas: give it about 2 hours
[10/22/2008 06:00:08 PM] Robert Douglas: then there will be a problem
[10/22/2008 06:00:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: man this takes a while
[10/22/2008 06:00:54 PM] Robert Douglas: normally it is quick
[10/22/2008 06:01:02 PM] Robert Douglas: but u have to lower the TTL value
[10/22/2008 06:01:04 PM] Robert Douglas: to speed it up
[10/22/2008 06:01:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: on my dns server?
[10/22/2008 06:01:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or on your server?
[10/22/2008 06:01:45 PM] Robert Douglas: on my dns server
[10/22/2008 06:02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is register name server?
[10/22/2008 06:02:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: under management tools?
[10/22/2008 06:02:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is that just setting up a subdomain?
[10/22/2008 06:02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, u need to create your own name servers
[10/22/2008 06:02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: for the domain
[10/22/2008 06:02:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am confused
[10/22/2008 06:03:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have my server set up
[10/22/2008 06:03:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what does that have to do with your server?
[10/22/2008 06:03:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i gotta get this shit done, can i msg u in like 1 hour?

[10/23/2008 03:37:34 PM] Robert Douglas: TTL actually tells the dns servers when to check back again for updated DNS information

[11/05/2008 01:24:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what does your mod security configuration look like?
[11/05/2008 01:25:14 PM] Robert Douglas: i think cpanel/whm install automatically takes care of it
[11/05/2008 01:25:20 PM] Robert Douglas: are you looking for a more secure config?
[11/05/2008 01:41:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it keeps giving me an error
[11/05/2008 01:43:13 PM] Robert Douglas: have you tried enabling it with no options?
[11/05/2008 02:15:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got it working
[11/05/2008 02:15:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i installed the wrong version
[11/05/2008 02:16:26 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[11/05/2008 02:16:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so all my directives weren't working because they were new
[11/05/2008 02:16:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: kinda silly
[11/05/2008 02:16:53 PM] Robert Douglas: when is that media server going to be finished
[11/05/2008 02:16:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: some mirror was disorganized
[11/05/2008 02:17:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably never
[11/05/2008 02:17:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am too busy to work on it
[11/05/2008 02:17:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i could work on the zipping part
[11/05/2008 02:17:14 PM] Robert Douglas: a friend of mine is putting together a HUGE 10 TB array w/ multiple redundancies
[11/05/2008 02:17:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i hit a roadblock with the vlc thing
[11/05/2008 02:17:34 PM] Robert Douglas: and a dedicated line to the server
[11/05/2008 02:17:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to make him just a basic file server based website
[11/05/2008 02:17:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i was hoping that something sexy could be made out of your media server
[11/05/2008 02:18:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i know
[11/05/2008 02:19:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to fix up the install too, so maybe after this winter? it would be great if you want to try it out, i have never tried it on something that large before
[11/05/2008 02:19:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you are welcome to the code, but the install process needs a lot of work so it would probably be more of a pain then it is worth
[11/05/2008 02:20:20 PM] Robert Douglas: well, even if it can easily be installed, there are still a ton of neccesssary featyres that would be needed in order for it to be fully productive
[11/05/2008 02:20:26 PM] Robert Douglas: he wants to setup a billing system
[11/05/2008 02:20:29 PM] Robert Douglas: access controls
[11/05/2008 02:20:30 PM] Robert Douglas: etc..
[11/05/2008 02:21:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, a billing system would be pretty simple to add on, as well as access controls
[11/05/2008 02:21:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is probably the most modular site i have evar made
[11/05/2008 02:21:34 PM] Robert Douglas: you could actually sell that script once it is done
[11/05/2008 02:21:47 PM] Robert Douglas: encode it via ioncube or something
[11/05/2008 02:21:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/05/2008 02:21:55 PM] Robert Douglas: and sell it via a monthly license system
[11/05/2008 02:22:01 PM] Robert Douglas: so people can setup their own file sharing network
[11/05/2008 02:22:08 PM] Robert Douglas: you need to figure out a way to encrypt the transfer
[11/05/2008 02:22:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have a set of modules that load the different types of files, i want to add zip files
[11/05/2008 02:22:15 PM] Robert Douglas: so something sniffing packets cant tell what data is sent
[11/05/2008 02:22:40 PM] Robert Douglas: maybe even make it to the point where you send a password protected zip files
[11/05/2008 02:22:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and a set of plugins, so the billing thing would go in the plugins section which is basically just a standalone page
[11/05/2008 02:23:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be cool
[11/05/2008 02:23:16 PM] Robert Douglas: the encryption thing is a must
[11/05/2008 02:23:25 PM] Robert Douglas: because nobody wants to use it with the potential ability to get caught
[11/05/2008 02:23:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/05/2008 02:23:59 PM] Robert Douglas: actually, the more i think about it, i dont think we could zip the file, just because of the massive processing time required from the CPU
[11/05/2008 02:24:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/05/2008 02:24:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i wonder how https looks for file downloads
[11/05/2008 02:24:26 PM] Robert Douglas: if everything was done over https, it may be good enough
[11/05/2008 02:24:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[11/05/2008 02:24:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: torrents
[11/05/2008 02:24:38 PM] Robert Douglas: torrents arent secure tho
[11/05/2008 02:24:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe even encrypted torrents
[11/05/2008 02:24:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: some clients support it
[11/05/2008 02:24:57 PM] Robert Douglas: we wouldnt want the client to install anything additional
[11/05/2008 02:25:43 PM] Robert Douglas: we would need to find a way to handle it all via a network
[11/05/2008 02:25:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll talk to one of the server guys and see if there is a way we can encrypt it all via https
[11/05/2008 02:25:55 PM] Robert Douglas: unless we do some kind of zip compression that compresses it 0% and add a password
[11/05/2008 02:26:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i know the overhead for that isn't too bad
[11/05/2008 02:26:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/05/2008 02:27:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but then they could just remove the header to the zip file and get access to it without the password
[11/05/2008 02:27:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anyways there is a lot of stuff i would like to add, but i don't have the time
[11/05/2008 02:27:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it does use smarty for the basic output though
[11/05/2008 02:27:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is only 2 modes, basic and ajax
[11/05/2008 02:27:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wanted like 6
[11/05/2008 02:28:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the basic mode isn't fully functional
[11/05/2008 02:28:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it works
[11/05/2008 02:28:20 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[11/05/2008 02:28:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it doesn't have all the features available
[11/05/2008 02:28:47 PM] Robert Douglas: well it is a shame you dont have time for it, it is a very promising project
[11/05/2008 02:29:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i do have both extremes though, basic is like text only and some forms, and the ajax is ridiculously graphical
[11/05/2008 02:29:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to add another subdomain
[11/05/2008 02:36:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lawl

[11/05/2008 02:38:40 PM] Robert Douglas: how's flag waether?
[11/05/2008 02:48:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cold
[11/05/2008 02:49:12 PM] Robert Douglas: i rode my bike here this morning
[11/05/2008 02:49:17 PM] Robert Douglas: at like 730am
[11/05/2008 02:49:22 PM] Robert Douglas: it was pretty cold
[11/05/2008 02:49:32 PM] Robert Douglas: nothing that requires me to wear a jacket yet though
[11/05/2008 02:49:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to do a nice ride to flag
[11/05/2008 02:49:45 PM] Robert Douglas: before the snow/rain comes
[11/05/2008 02:50:00 PM] Robert Douglas: put on some under armor and i'll be fine

[11/14/2008 12:57:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i could find a way to get ffmpeg to work
[11/14/2008 12:57:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i seem to recall ffmpeg working ok with audio, and vlc uses ffmpeg but something was wrong with tying them together so streaming wouldn't work
[11/14/2008 12:58:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will try to finish those few things up this winter
[11/14/2008 12:59:04 PM] Robert Douglas: would be badass to get that server up and running
[11/14/2008 12:59:17 PM] Robert Douglas: even better if you can setup permissions/user control
[11/14/2008 01:00:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, i was planning on doing users and permissions, just a simple modification to my modules to add levels, i wanted to set up profiles for users.  more importantly though is getting the admin section working

[11/19/2008 11:50:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: try that, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[11/19/2008 11:51:05 AM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://cse441.rp-s.com/customer/)http://cse441.rp-s.com/customer/
[11/19/2008 11:51:22 AM] Robert Douglas: trying to display the debug values at the top of the page, but display the values of the arrays AFTER the page fully executes
[11/19/2008 11:51:42 AM] Robert Douglas: i was thinking about putting it in a div tag and just updating the contents of the div after the page loads
[11/19/2008 11:51:46 AM] Robert Douglas: via javascript or something
[11/19/2008 11:52:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i used to do that with the jambonie site
[11/19/2008 11:52:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is easy to do if you use templates
[11/19/2008 11:52:34 AM] Robert Douglas: o really, ill have to check out the code u used
[11/19/2008 11:52:39 AM] Robert Douglas: i have a header/footer template
[11/19/2008 11:53:15 AM] Robert Douglas: ur print_r arrays get printed after the page fully executes?
[11/19/2008 11:53:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/19/2008 11:53:46 AM] Robert Douglas: sexy
[11/19/2008 11:53:50 AM] Robert Douglas: i still have the jambonie code
[11/19/2008 11:53:53 AM] Robert Douglas: so ill have to check it out
[11/19/2008 11:54:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i would execute every part of the pages, and then at the bottom of the php, i can insert it at the top, so as long as there is nothing wrong with the insertion part, everything works
[11/19/2008 11:54:51 AM] Robert Douglas: at the bottom of the php, u just sen the ob_flush command
[11/19/2008 11:54:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also if you want to use a output buffer
[11/19/2008 11:55:04 AM] Robert Douglas: and then it updates the stuff after u do ob_start
[11/19/2008 11:55:06 AM] Robert Douglas: right?
[11/19/2008 11:55:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[11/19/2008 11:55:56 AM] Robert Douglas: ill check out jambonie and see if i can get it implemented
[11/19/2008 11:56:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you use ob_start(), do all the php stuff, then use $page = ob_get_contents() then tack on your debug info to the beginning of it
[11/19/2008 11:57:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and then ob_end_clean()
[11/19/2008 11:57:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: use the get_contents() at the bottom of the scrip
[11/19/2008 11:57:34 AM] Robert Douglas: right now every page looks like this: 
php include for the header 
page html/php content 
php include for the footer
[11/19/2008 11:57:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *script
[11/19/2008 11:57:43 AM] Robert Douglas: so is it possible with that?
[11/19/2008 11:57:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[11/19/2008 11:57:52 AM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[11/19/2008 11:58:07 AM] Robert Douglas: i'll try it out
[11/19/2008 11:58:14 AM] Robert Douglas: heading home
[11/19/2008 11:58:17 AM] Robert Douglas: gtg
[11/19/2008 11:58:21 AM] Robert Douglas: ill msg u in a bit
[11/19/2008 11:59:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so use 
 ob_start()
 php include header
 page html php/content
 php include footer
 $page = ob_get_contents()
 $page = $debug . $page;
 ob_clean_end();
 print $page;

[11/19/2008 12:19:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm thinking it may be easier just to update a div id with some javascript
[11/19/2008 12:25:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you could always put it at the bottom then use css to make it go to the top
[11/19/2008 12:26:01 PM] Robert Douglas: i think i found a pretty ez way

[11/19/2008 12:27:00 PM] Robert Douglas: just gotta store print_r inside the variable
[11/19/2008 12:34:43 PM] Robert Douglas: u see that?
[11/19/2008 12:38:25 PM] Robert Douglas: damn
[11/19/2008 12:38:39 PM] Robert Douglas: stupid javascript and it's gay line escapes!
[11/19/2008 12:52:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[11/19/2008 12:53:20 PM] Robert Douglas: <?php echo str_replace("\n", "\\n", $debug); ?>
[11/19/2008 12:53:30 PM] Robert Douglas: just replaced the new line with one javascript will like
[11/19/2008 12:55:12 PM] Robert Douglas: can u send $_POST information without using a form?
[11/19/2008 12:55:22 PM] Robert Douglas: without storing it in a session?
[11/19/2008 12:55:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not sure
[11/19/2008 12:55:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think so, if you use a library, i don't know how though
[11/19/2008 12:57:18 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think there is one
[11/19/2008 12:57:22 PM] Robert Douglas: looked online
[11/19/2008 12:57:24 PM] Robert Douglas: nothing
[11/19/2008 12:57:41 PM] Robert Douglas: what happens is that when u login, it posts to one page, and then changes the header to take u to another pag
[11/19/2008 12:57:59 PM] Robert Douglas: so u lose the posted data that you sent
[11/19/2008 01:10:36 PM] Robert Douglas: is there a way to save all info that is sent to the mysql_query function?
[11/19/2008 01:10:47 PM] Robert Douglas: without sending the info as a variable
[11/19/2008 01:53:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you don't want to use a session?
[11/19/2008 01:54:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: seems like a session would be the best solution
[11/19/2008 02:07:33 PM] Robert Douglas: because I want to store the session variables separately

[11/23/2008 11:05:19 AM] Robert Douglas: with javascript, is there a way to open a popup, write to it, and basically refresh the window every time you write
[11/23/2008 11:42:52 AM] Robert Douglas: nevermind, got it
[11/23/2008 11:43:05 AM] Robert Douglas: just had to add window.close to the page that created the javascript popup
[11/23/2008 12:12:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the answer is yes
[11/23/2008 12:12:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can return with a window object and from that you can get .document
[11/23/2008 12:12:39 PM] Robert Douglas: yea, i got it
[11/23/2008 12:12:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: window.document.write
[11/23/2008 12:12:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and you can do a lot of fancy stuff with frames
[11/23/2008 12:12:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i didnt add the document.close() 
[11/23/2008 12:13:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did i ever show you that Ext JS made an Open File button?
[11/23/2008 12:13:12 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://sce412.rp-s.com)http://sce412.rp-s.com
[11/23/2008 12:13:18 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://cse412.rp-s.com)http://cse412.rp-s.com
[11/23/2008 12:13:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i think so
[11/23/2008 12:13:27 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont remember it
[11/23/2008 12:14:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it basically creates this little domain that the real browse button moves around in, but then it draws a custom button on top of the domain, so when you click you are always clicking on the browse button that comes with file fields
[11/23/2008 12:14:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that's very sexy
[11/23/2008 12:14:58 PM] Robert Douglas: have a link?

[11/23/2008 12:16:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i always ssee people trying to style the browse button lol
[11/23/2008 12:16:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yup
[11/23/2008 12:16:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think i will ever use a different styling library on a site
[11/23/2008 12:17:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ext js has every capability i would ever need and the API is so easy to use
[11/23/2008 12:17:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i love that select photo button
[11/23/2008 12:17:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i should make an extjs vBulletin template, then replace codepaster with that
[11/23/2008 12:17:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be hot
[11/23/2008 12:17:42 PM] Robert Douglas: hell yeah
[11/23/2008 12:17:45 PM] Robert Douglas: would take a lot of time tho man
[11/23/2008 12:19:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wouldn't be that much, vBulletin only uses maybe 10 different types of pages
[11/23/2008 12:19:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wouldn't bother with admin stuff probably
[11/23/2008 12:19:47 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, dont messw ith vb admin
[11/23/2008 12:19:52 PM] Robert Douglas: vb is very powerful
[11/23/2008 12:20:08 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be awesome if u converted it into a template lol
[11/23/2008 12:20:19 PM] Robert Douglas: for vb that is
[11/23/2008 12:20:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: vb uses templates though
[11/23/2008 12:20:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: doesn't it?
[11/23/2008 12:20:48 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[11/23/2008 12:20:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i thought vb used smarty
[11/23/2008 12:21:01 PM] Robert Douglas: but the code for the forms and stuff are partly in tempaltes, and partly in php
[11/23/2008 12:21:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm teh suck
[11/23/2008 12:21:22 PM] Robert Douglas: remember xcart?

[12/12/2008 04:07:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wonder what kind of speed losses that includes

[12/16/2008 01:15:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so apparently my media server had a bug and wasn't adding new files, i fixed it today
[12/16/2008 01:15:25 PM] Robert Douglas: media server r0x
[12/16/2008 01:15:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yup
[12/16/2008 01:16:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my cron script wasn't starting off in the same place every time, it would restart with the next watched directory, so i was only searching like the first 100 folders
[12/16/2008 01:17:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i hacked into a counter stgrike server
[12/16/2008 01:17:15 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[12/16/2008 01:17:19 PM] Robert Douglas: bastards banned me
[12/16/2008 01:17:20 PM] Robert Douglas: so i got in
[12/16/2008 01:17:22 PM] Robert Douglas: unban ftw
[12/16/2008 01:17:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[12/16/2008 01:17:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how did you hack in?
[12/16/2008 01:17:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: default password?
[12/16/2008 01:18:14 PM] Robert Douglas: there was an ftp account that ppl use to upload hacker's demos
[12/16/2008 01:18:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[12/16/2008 01:18:22 PM] Robert Douglas: it was restricted to a directory
[12/16/2008 01:18:25 PM] Robert Douglas: but using a flaw with php
[12/16/2008 01:18:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i was able to get access to everything else
[12/16/2008 01:18:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what was the php flaw
[12/16/2008 01:18:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[12/16/2008 01:19:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you upload a php script and run it?
[12/16/2008 01:19:07 PM] Robert Douglas: open base dir
[12/16/2008 01:19:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow
[12/16/2008 01:19:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think it is a flaw
[12/16/2008 01:19:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think the flaw was you could upload php scripts to the ftp site
[12/16/2008 01:20:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they should have filtering turned on so only allow media types
[12/16/2008 01:20:18 PM] Robert Douglas: that wouldnt matter
[12/16/2008 01:20:23 PM] Robert Douglas: because i uploaded the php as a demo file
[12/16/2008 01:20:26 PM] Robert Douglas: then renamed the file
[12/16/2008 01:20:29 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[12/16/2008 01:20:32 PM] Robert Douglas: so they have no trace
[12/16/2008 01:20:40 PM] Robert Douglas: and actually, i named it to an already existing demo file
[12/16/2008 01:20:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or have page execution disabled for the ftp directory
[12/16/2008 01:20:58 PM] Robert Douglas: then i dropped in a logger that keeps track of all forum login attempts based ont he post value
[12/16/2008 01:21:17 PM] Robert Douglas: then every time someone tries to login
[12/16/2008 01:21:20 PM] Robert Douglas: it updates the log file
[12/16/2008 01:21:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should stop monitoring and start destroying
[12/16/2008 01:21:30 PM] Robert Douglas: then i access the log file using the w3 validator
[12/16/2008 01:21:40 PM] Robert Douglas: so it shows that IP as the referrer for the view
[12/16/2008 01:21:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: put like millions on entries in their forum that just say pwnd
[12/16/2008 01:21:48 PM] Robert Douglas: so they cant even tell when i view the fucking log
[12/16/2008 01:22:05 PM] Robert Douglas: nah
[12/16/2008 01:22:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i have a solid plan
[12/16/2008 01:22:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: man we are so 1337

[12/16/2008 01:22:52 PM] Robert Douglas: i found out what the backup scheedule is for their hosting account
[12/16/2008 01:22:52 PM] Robert Douglas: they keep 1 week backups only
[12/16/2008 01:22:56 PM] Robert Douglas: so i am going to delete everything right before the backup starts
[12/16/2008 01:23:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so when it backs up the account
[12/16/2008 01:23:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[12/16/2008 01:23:17 PM] Robert Douglas: it will have no info
[12/16/2008 01:23:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats awesome!
[12/16/2008 01:23:20 PM] Robert Douglas: overwrite old info
[12/16/2008 01:23:21 PM] Robert Douglas: then
[12/16/2008 01:23:31 PM] Robert Douglas: i toss in htaccess
[12/16/2008 01:23:36 PM] Robert Douglas: to ip deny their major IPs
[12/16/2008 01:23:37 PM] Robert Douglas: then i edit DNS
[12/16/2008 01:23:44 PM] Robert Douglas: to fake dns records
[12/16/2008 01:24:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol

[12/16/2008 01:28:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: zip files are done now, i am not sure what else to work on, i guess preferences and logins would be good, access privileges.
[12/16/2008 01:28:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: still can't get video streaming to work with windows media player
[12/16/2008 01:28:49 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have an alternative to vmware?
[12/16/2008 01:28:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i cant get that shit instaleld for some reason
[12/16/2008 01:29:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you need ai32libs
[12/16/2008 01:29:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *ia32libs
[12/16/2008 01:29:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or some shit like that
[12/16/2008 01:29:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll bet that is your problem
[12/16/2008 01:29:38 PM] Robert Douglas: exokaiunb
[12/16/2008 01:29:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not sure what that means

[12/16/2008 01:30:08 PM] Robert Douglas: srry, i was looking on laptop screen while trying to type
[12/16/2008 01:30:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you are trying to install vmware on linux, you have to have the intel architecture 32 libraries installed, otherwise it won't compile
[12/16/2008 01:30:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i want it on XP
[12/16/2008 01:31:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: vmware won't install on windows?
[12/16/2008 01:31:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that doesn't make sense
[12/16/2008 01:31:27 PM] Robert Douglas: it installed, but doesnt allow me to create/open any VMs
[12/16/2008 01:31:33 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://communities.vmware.com/message/1099447#1099447)http://communities.vmware.com/message/1099447#1099447

[12/16/2008 01:32:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so there is the microsoft one
[12/16/2008 01:32:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Virtual PC
[12/16/2008 01:32:21 PM] Robert Douglas: dfoesnt run linux :(
[12/16/2008 01:32:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and Xen
[12/16/2008 01:32:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but those are the only ones i've heard of/used
[12/16/2008 01:33:11 PM] Robert Douglas: is Xen any good?
[12/16/2008 01:33:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have heard really good things about it
[12/16/2008 01:33:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: apparently it can pass pci devices to a VM
[12/16/2008 01:33:39 PM] Robert Douglas: oooo
[12/16/2008 01:33:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: which is a major benefit over vmware
[12/16/2008 01:33:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to get wireless card for my desktop
[12/16/2008 01:33:54 PM] Robert Douglas: and have one machine ont he VM
[12/16/2008 01:34:00 PM] Robert Douglas: one regular
[12/16/2008 01:34:02 PM] Robert Douglas: one wireless
[12/16/2008 01:34:03 PM] Robert Douglas: one wired
[12/16/2008 01:34:12 PM] Robert Douglas: dual internet ftw
[12/16/2008 01:34:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you try it out, let me know how it goes
[12/16/2008 01:34:29 PM] Robert Douglas: will do
[12/16/2008 01:34:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: brb

[12/16/2008 01:36:41 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[12/16/2008 01:37:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: stupid furnace uses all the hot water

[12/16/2008 01:38:01 PM] Robert Douglas: good comparison between the 3
[12/16/2008 01:38:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nice
[12/16/2008 01:39:16 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.xen.org/)http://www.xen.org/

[12/16/2008 01:39:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol xen runs on bare metal
[12/16/2008 01:39:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah wtf
[12/16/2008 01:39:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah citrix is the other one i was going to mention
[12/16/2008 01:40:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but citrix is more focused enormous terminal arrays
[12/16/2008 01:40:16 PM] Robert Douglas: seems like citrix uses Xen
[12/16/2008 01:40:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so Xen and Infrastructure 3 come with their own OS
[12/16/2008 01:41:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you don't have to install Linux and then install vmware
[12/16/2008 01:41:14 PM] Robert Douglas: well i already have xp
[12/16/2008 01:41:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they come with their own hacked down version of linux
[12/16/2008 01:41:21 PM] Robert Douglas: i want to install it on xp
[12/16/2008 01:41:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably built for different architectures even
[12/16/2008 01:50:43 PM] Robert Douglas: u still using synergy?
[12/16/2008 01:51:01 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea if there is a way to use it over 2 networks?
[12/16/2008 01:54:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you just have to have the ports forwarded
[12/16/2008 01:54:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then you can use what ever IP addresses you want
[12/16/2008 01:54:23 PM] Robert Douglas: can u forward ports to an external ip?
[12/16/2008 01:54:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't have to do it in synergy
[12/16/2008 01:54:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just in whatever routers
[12/16/2008 01:55:04 PM] Robert Douglas: didnt think my router allowed for that
[12/16/2008 01:56:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all routers have port forwarding, that is the point of a router
[12/16/2008 01:56:27 PM] Robert Douglas: port forwards to internal IPs
[12/16/2008 01:56:30 PM] Robert Douglas: not external ips
[12/16/2008 01:56:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if they are internal then you don't have to forward them
[12/16/2008 01:57:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so explain how your 2 networks are set up
[12/16/2008 01:57:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that you want to use synergy across
[12/16/2008 01:57:28 PM] Robert Douglas: pretend that my laptop is in ur house
[12/16/2008 01:57:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[12/16/2008 01:57:37 PM] Robert Douglas: and i wantt o use synergy to connect to it through my house
[12/16/2008 01:58:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, so on your router you have to forward the synergy port to your desktop
[12/16/2008 01:58:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and on my router i have to forward the synergy port to your laptop
[12/16/2008 01:58:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then you just connect using my routers IP address
[12/16/2008 02:00:15 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm
[12/16/2008 02:00:32 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, thius new back track program is really sexy
[12/16/2008 02:00:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so if you have a router, and then 2 seperate routers underneath that, you connect using their IP addresses, and leave the top level router alone
[12/16/2008 02:00:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i used it back when it was auditor
[12/16/2008 02:00:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is it?
[12/16/2008 02:00:54 PM] Robert Douglas: security tools
[12/16/2008 02:02:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it's called back track?
[12/16/2008 02:02:29 PM] Robert Douglas: backtrack

[03/01/2009 07:20:17 PM] Robert Douglas: any suggestions on good iptables tutorials?
[03/01/2009 07:21:24 PM] Robert Douglas: we have to do things like enable http, ping, ftp  from private network to public
[03/01/2009 07:21:29 PM] Robert Douglas: disable http from public to private
[03/01/2009 07:21:32 PM] Robert Douglas: stuff like that
[03/01/2009 07:39:21 PM] Robert Douglas: so no suggestions?
[03/01/2009 08:19:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you shouldn't allow ping
[03/01/2009 08:19:33 PM] Robert Douglas: it's part of the project

[03/10/2009 03:52:12 PM] Robert Douglas: there is something wrong with the nameservers i think
[03/10/2009 03:52:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: whos name server? yours or mine?
[03/10/2009 03:52:58 PM] Robert Douglas: monolithicmedia.org is pointed to ns1.bjcullinan.com
[03/10/2009 03:53:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ya
[03/10/2009 03:53:16 PM] Robert Douglas: so dns is right
[03/10/2009 03:53:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and ns1.bjcullinan.com resolves just fine
[03/10/2009 03:55:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think there is anything else we can do other than changing the nameserver address
[03/10/2009 03:55:19 PM] Robert Douglas: very weird

[03/10/2009 03:56:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll see if i can run some tests to fiugre it out
[03/10/2009 03:59:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: must just not have resolved on our ISPs DNS
[03/10/2009 03:59:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should give it another day
[03/10/2009 03:59:40 PM] Robert Douglas: mind if i switch the DNS to my server to test it?
[03/10/2009 03:59:43 PM] Robert Douglas: or should we wait?
[03/10/2009 03:59:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lets wait a little longer
[03/10/2009 03:59:55 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, sounds good

[03/21/2009 01:13:21 PM] Robert Douglas: you should get on the server and do a tracert to rp-s.com

[03/21/2009 01:14:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[03/21/2009 01:14:44 PM] Robert Douglas: something wrong with the server
[03/21/2009 01:14:48 PM] Robert Douglas: have u restarted it?
[03/21/2009 01:15:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but if i am tracing to rp-s it isn't my server
[03/21/2009 01:15:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it stops at their gateway
[03/21/2009 01:15:31 PM] Robert Douglas: but if your server cant talk to anyone on the outside
[03/21/2009 01:15:36 PM] Robert Douglas: then something is wrong
[03/21/2009 01:16:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: k i'll reboot the webserver
[03/21/2009 01:16:31 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont think it is a webserver problem
[03/21/2009 01:16:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah me neither
[03/21/2009 01:17:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i've rebooted our modem too
[03/21/2009 01:17:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe it is the default gateway is wrong
[03/21/2009 01:17:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nah then i shouldn't get any connection
[03/21/2009 01:19:55 PM] Robert Douglas: could it be NAT?
[03/21/2009 01:20:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am running it under NAT
[03/21/2009 01:20:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i have the modem which sucks, running my router in DMZ and i set NAT to be enabled, then i assigned my router the static IP
[03/21/2009 01:21:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: does that make sense?
[03/21/2009 01:22:29 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[03/21/2009 01:22:59 PM] Robert Douglas: did u verify that the static IP is within the range?
[03/21/2009 01:23:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: our ISP provides us a static IP
[03/21/2009 01:23:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so yes
[03/21/2009 01:23:36 PM] Robert Douglas: ah, ur router is the static IP
[03/21/2009 01:23:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[03/21/2009 01:23:47 PM] Robert Douglas: how is the IP of ur server assigned?
[03/21/2009 01:23:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: DHCP through my router
[03/21/2009 01:24:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: static
[03/21/2009 01:24:26 PM] Robert Douglas: humm
[03/21/2009 01:24:31 PM] Robert Douglas: something is wrong with NAT
[03/21/2009 01:24:41 PM] Robert Douglas: because if NAT was working, ui would be able to see outside ur router

[03/21/2009 01:29:34 PM] Robert Douglas: if that's the case, you need to run some packet sniffer like wireshark or cain
[03/21/2009 01:29:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: trace works, so i can see outside world
[03/21/2009 01:29:40 PM] Robert Douglas: and see where the packets are dropping
[03/21/2009 01:29:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but can't get in

[03/25/2009 12:26:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you know you can use pretty dirs without mod_rewrite
[03/25/2009 12:27:08 AM] Robert Douglas: in IIS?
[03/25/2009 12:27:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe not in IIS
[03/25/2009 12:27:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but in apache
[03/25/2009 12:27:26 AM] Robert Douglas: got it working, had to stop and start the website in IIS, and it worked
[03/25/2009 12:27:30 AM] Robert Douglas: didnt know that
[03/25/2009 12:27:33 AM] Robert Douglas: how?
[03/25/2009 12:28:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you have a link for example (Link: www.website.com/index.php/Something/Somethinelse/text.php)www.website.com/index.php/Something/Somethinelse/text.php
[03/25/2009 12:28:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the first script is the one that is executed
[03/25/2009 12:29:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so everything after that is detectable using the request_uri variable
[03/25/2009 12:29:44 AM] Robert Douglas: so how does it know?
[03/25/2009 12:29:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is just something stupid that apache does
[03/25/2009 12:30:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it runs the first valid script that is found in the path
[03/25/2009 12:31:11 AM] Robert Douglas: wow
[03/25/2009 12:31:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[03/25/2009 12:32:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it can make things really vulnerable if you don't handle it properly
[03/25/2009 12:32:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like if you use script_path variable, it can be spoofed by adding slashes and stuff
[03/25/2009 12:32:52 AM] Robert Douglas: i've never used script_path before
[03/25/2009 12:33:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, php_path is the one to use
[03/25/2009 12:33:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or php_script or whatever
[03/25/2009 12:33:30 AM] Robert Douglas: where do u set script_path?
[03/25/2009 12:33:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is under the $_server vars
[03/25/2009 12:33:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is also script_filepath which is also vulnerable
[03/25/2009 12:34:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i got my media site downloading amazon product ids for albums and downloading album art into the database
[03/25/2009 12:35:05 AM] Robert Douglas: that';s cool, have u written a tutorial on how to do it?
[03/25/2009 12:35:13 AM] Robert Douglas: with the script_path settings?
[03/25/2009 12:35:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you mean?
[03/25/2009 12:35:33 AM] Robert Douglas: you should write a quick tutorial
[03/25/2009 12:35:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how to exploit it?
[03/25/2009 12:35:34 AM] Robert Douglas: with examples
[03/25/2009 12:35:36 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[03/25/2009 12:35:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah maybe
[03/25/2009 12:35:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: too busy with the site

[04/01/2009 10:44:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because it has to be higher then it was before
[04/01/2009 10:44:20 PM] Robert Douglas: you're talking about the TTL values?
[04/01/2009 10:44:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yea
[04/01/2009 10:44:35 PM] Robert Douglas: i think those are changed to the receiving server's end
[04/01/2009 10:45:42 PM] Robert Douglas: when we change DNS, we usually lower the TTL value
[04/01/2009 10:45:46 PM] Robert Douglas: then change it
[04/01/2009 10:45:50 PM] Robert Douglas: and raise it again
[04/01/2009 10:46:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[04/01/2009 10:47:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my other domains were immediate but maybe thats because they weren't previously registered
[04/01/2009 10:47:20 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that's usually the case
[04/01/2009 10:47:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well everything is set up on my end
[04/01/2009 10:47:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dig works at my IP

[04/01/2009 10:54:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the windows like one is a little slow, and not finished
[04/01/2009 10:55:00 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, i really thought that one looked cool
[04/01/2009 10:55:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this one i made rapid progress on because i copied it from microsoft live
[04/01/2009 10:55:05 PM] Robert Douglas: this one u have up now is fast
[04/01/2009 10:55:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fastish, i made some speed improvements today
[04/01/2009 10:57:08 PM] Robert Douglas: runs quick
[04/01/2009 10:57:20 PM] Robert Douglas: Use remote access to browse and download files.

[04/01/2009 10:57:34 PM] Robert Douglas: empty dir should say no files
[04/01/2009 10:57:37 PM] Robert Douglas: or folder is empty or something
[04/01/2009 10:58:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm that is a feature for the template, i can do that after i study
[04/01/2009 10:59:55 PM] Robert Douglas: do u have all my mp3s?
[04/01/2009 11:00:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: unlikely
[04/01/2009 11:00:26 PM] Robert Douglas: when u coming down here again? u should hook up a drive and copy them
[04/01/2009 11:00:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i am going to write a sync script that syncs 2 libraries
[04/01/2009 11:00:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just bought a server case

[04/01/2009 11:04:05 PM] Robert Douglas: hahaha
[04/01/2009 11:04:17 PM] Robert Douglas: u should just call ur place a datacenter
[04/01/2009 11:07:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, it is smaller then i had hoped
[04/01/2009 11:07:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but big ones are expensive
[04/01/2009 11:10:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you still not have your stuff in raid?
[04/01/2009 11:10:47 PM] Robert Douglas: my main drives are in a raid 0+1
[04/01/2009 11:10:49 PM] Robert Douglas: the raptors
[04/01/2009 11:10:53 PM] Robert Douglas: but my other drives are not
[04/01/2009 11:11:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did i tell you i am working on a reports plugin that shows files that have weird names, and checks for errors in the logs, and shows speed stats
[04/01/2009 11:11:14 PM] Robert Douglas: nah man
[04/01/2009 11:11:17 PM] Robert Douglas: that's cool
[04/01/2009 11:11:22 PM] Robert Douglas: plugin for what?
[04/01/2009 11:11:23 PM] Robert Douglas: windows?
[04/01/2009 11:11:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for the site
[04/01/2009 11:11:46 PM] Robert Douglas: ah.. does it automatically rename the files too?
[04/01/2009 11:12:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is divided into templates, modules that control data I/O, and plugins that control user input
[04/01/2009 11:12:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will auto rename them
[04/01/2009 11:12:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like detecting multiple _-_ will rename to space-space
[04/01/2009 11:13:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is pure model/view/controller architecture
[04/01/2009 11:13:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the data model being the database where all queries go through the modules, the templates being the view which is interchangable, and the controller being the plugins that accept user input
[04/01/2009 11:13:46 PM] Robert Douglas: thats cool
[04/01/2009 11:16:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i am going to add users soon
[04/01/2009 11:16:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i learned a ton about security from my friend too
[04/01/2009 11:16:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i am going to hack your site now
[04/01/2009 11:16:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: j/k j/k
[04/01/2009 11:17:00 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[04/01/2009 11:17:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i've seen a couple good tutorials on how to do a MITM attack on HTTPS websites
[04/01/2009 11:18:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean like shitty hacks, like session highjacking
[04/01/2009 11:19:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: any time you do like print PHP_SELF
[04/01/2009 11:19:18 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah

[04/01/2009 11:30:11 PM] Robert Douglas: that program is badass man
[04/01/2009 11:30:20 PM] Robert Douglas: it lets u register for an email account
[04/01/2009 11:30:34 PM] Robert Douglas: then it checks the email account and clicks on the link inside it!!
[04/01/2009 11:30:57 PM] Robert Douglas: it gets around captcha stuff too
[04/01/2009 11:31:02 PM] Robert Douglas: made by a bunch of russian hackers
[04/01/2009 11:31:09 PM] Robert Douglas: they only accept western union type payments

[04/04/2009 12:11:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because my server still returns everything is ok

[04/04/2009 12:40:14 PM] Robert Douglas: it's definitely a DNS problem
[04/04/2009 12:40:25 PM] Robert Douglas: my friend suggests that you setup a 2nd nameserver
[04/04/2009 12:40:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and?
[04/04/2009 12:41:04 PM] Robert Douglas: the DNS for the domain should be ns1 and ns2
[04/04/2009 12:41:08 PM] Robert Douglas: two nameservers
[04/04/2009 12:41:10 PM] Robert Douglas: and two IPs
[04/04/2009 12:41:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: want to put your NS on it?
[04/04/2009 12:41:59 PM] Robert Douglas: i could, but you really need 2 nameservers for DNS to work properly
[04/04/2009 12:42:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my other domains work fine
[04/04/2009 12:43:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anyways, do you have space i can rsync everything to and when my server goes down i can pay you hourly?
[04/04/2009 12:43:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need email too
[04/04/2009 12:43:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think my router supports this thing where i can enter an outside IP address for a port forward
[04/04/2009 12:44:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i can just send it somewhere else immediately
[04/04/2009 12:44:08 PM] Robert Douglas: how much space would u need?
[04/04/2009 12:44:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe a gig
[04/04/2009 12:44:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: probably not even that much
[04/04/2009 12:44:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for just my blog it's probably under 100MB
[04/04/2009 12:44:57 PM] Robert Douglas: do you have a business account with your ISP?
[04/04/2009 12:45:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no
[04/04/2009 12:45:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i think you need that in order to get DNS to work, since you need 2 IPs to have a proper DNS server
[04/04/2009 12:47:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you add yours, that makes 2
[04/04/2009 12:47:58 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure if that would work, but if you want, i can add it
[04/04/2009 12:48:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am sure that if you add your DNS the org will work, but i guess we should try it
[04/04/2009 12:49:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe it's my ISP
[04/04/2009 12:49:22 PM] Robert Douglas: it
[04/04/2009 12:49:34 PM] Robert Douglas: it isnt your ISP, it is the fact your DNS server only has 1 NS
[04/04/2009 12:49:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but why do my other domains work, but .orgs dont?

[05/08/2009 03:00:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to try to make it non-database dependent, so basically it would to the same stuff as db power amp just by running a script on a directory

[05/10/2009 06:44:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm, is there any cheap option that you guys could still make a couple bucks off?
[05/10/2009 06:44:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just for printing
[05/10/2009 06:46:13 PM] Robert Douglas: we would just give it to u for cost
[05/10/2009 06:46:26 PM] Robert Douglas: ur best bet is to go through VP and get the biz cards with their logo on the back
[05/10/2009 06:46:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i think they run specials alll the time with free cards with their logo stuff on the back
[05/10/2009 06:47:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm, ok
[05/10/2009 06:47:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe when i get some extra cash i will ask for the pro design
[05/10/2009 06:48:08 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah no worries man

1. You cannot touch all your teeth with your tongue.  
 
2. All idiots, after reading the first truth, will try it.  
 
3. And discover that The first truth is a lie.  
 
4. You're smiling now because you're an idiot.  
 
5. You soon will forward this to another idiot.  
 
6. There's still a stupid smile on your face.
