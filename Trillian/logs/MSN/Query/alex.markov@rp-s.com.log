[06/21/2007 02:22:42 PM] Alex Markov: hey bro
[06/21/2007 02:22:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey
[06/21/2007 02:23:26 PM] Alex Markov: in a car on the treo :-#
[06/21/2007 02:23:33 PM] Alex Markov: 5 hour car ride
[06/21/2007 02:23:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: suck
[06/21/2007 02:25:54 PM] Alex Markov: whatcha doin
[06/21/2007 02:26:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: working on jambonie
[06/21/2007 02:28:21 PM] Alex Markov: anything interesting? let me get some details. I'm just curious what's going on with jam
[06/21/2007 02:28:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am making big changes to the way bands, songs, events, and users are displayed
[06/21/2007 02:29:07 PM] Alex Markov: how
[06/21/2007 02:29:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of writing custom code to display certain songs that a band has uploaded, it uses the search engine to output the edit fields
[06/21/2007 02:30:13 PM] Alex Markov: interesting
[06/21/2007 02:30:50 PM] Alex Markov: the media player area doesn't look as fresh as it can I think. and it sucks that its in a separate page
[06/21/2007 02:30:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: since its always putting out the same information just in different ways, i can completely customize the output in only 1 line of code, and that is processed by the search engine
[06/21/2007 02:32:16 PM] Alex Markov: very nice changes. good stuff

[08/02/2007 09:58:52 AM] Alex Markov: in excel
[08/02/2007 09:59:03 AM] Alex Markov: but each property is layed out all differently
[08/02/2007 09:59:09 AM] Alex Markov: no standardized layout
[08/02/2007 09:59:12 AM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "PROPERTY OVERVIEW.xlt"
[08/02/2007 09:59:19 AM] Alex Markov: so i am proposing this layout
[08/02/2007 09:59:42 AM] Alex Markov: should i like make a template for them?
[08/02/2007 10:00:17 AM] Alex Markov: is there anythings u can suggest to make it easier for them to input into this?
[08/02/2007 10:00:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: for once you are not sending me some stupid image
[08/02/2007 10:02:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: looks kind of simple does it cover all their information needs?
[08/02/2007 10:06:49 AM] Alex Markov: yes.its like a brief overview that everyone can print
[08/02/2007 10:07:00 AM] Alex Markov: its gonna be on server
[08/02/2007 10:07:12 AM] Alex Markov: so there will be 1 central overview of the property
[08/02/2007 10:07:33 AM] Alex Markov: should i make it into a tempalte file? or no reason for it
[08/02/2007 10:07:39 AM] Alex Markov: any features u think i should use?
[08/02/2007 10:10:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: looks good
[08/02/2007 10:17:24 AM] Alex Markov: k thanks
