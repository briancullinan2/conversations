[10/14/2007 02:23:56 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: heard you had a falling out with jo and keifer
[10/14/2007 02:27:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: they piss me off, so i am not hanging out with them anymore
[10/14/2007 02:27:28 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I see
[10/14/2007 02:28:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i actually don't remember the last time i enjoyed their company
[10/14/2007 02:29:07 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: hmmm
[10/14/2007 02:29:24 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: well you could have gone about dissasociating yourself with them in a different way
[10/14/2007 02:29:32 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: you were a little harsh
[10/14/2007 02:29:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah good, please tell me what i did wrong
[10/14/2007 02:32:13 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: well if it was me i would have just avoided hanging with them, not called them not invited them to things
[10/14/2007 02:32:25 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: hehe, you kinda exploded on them :P
[10/14/2007 02:34:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i asked them to go to a serious movie with me, that was my only mistake, i told keifer that we avoided inviting him to movies in order to defend my argument that people don't enjoy his habits; that is wasn't just me being irrational, but other people agree with me
[10/14/2007 02:37:15 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: yeah, i dunno why jo stays with him, poor girl, he treats her so badly
[10/14/2007 02:51:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: because she has no common sense
[10/14/2007 02:51:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she has a reserved personality
[10/14/2007 02:52:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it makes it easy for him to manipulate her
[10/14/2007 02:56:47 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: yup

[10/14/2007 03:29:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could use the company, it's a positive influence on me
[10/14/2007 03:29:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are generally a positive influence, as much as i hate it you tend to point out all of my faults
[10/14/2007 03:30:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would like to meet more people, intelligent people like you of course
[10/14/2007 03:30:29 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: haha, yes well usually when I come around  I don't want to be bringing female friends with me

[10/14/2007 03:36:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if you ever feel like being spontaneous again like when we ate delicious tacos, don't hesitate to ask, next time i promise not to leave you alone
[10/14/2007 03:37:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love doing things outside the usual routine
[10/14/2007 03:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: which includes never having a conversation with dave

[11/01/2007 07:11:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would just be horrible
[11/01/2007 07:11:33 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I'm sick of hearing you make fun of her like you have so many other options
[11/01/2007 07:11:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would have no one else to talk to
[11/01/2007 07:11:42 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: men are such pigs sometimes
[11/01/2007 07:11:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have other options
[11/01/2007 07:11:46 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and so superfical
[11/01/2007 07:12:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just don't pursue the other options because i'm looking for something real
[11/01/2007 07:12:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: something solid
[11/01/2007 07:12:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: women can be the exact same way

[11/01/2007 07:12:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you've never met a superficial woman?
[11/01/2007 07:12:45 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i'm not being elitist but i dont' go around guy bashing 
[11/01/2007 07:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you do plenty of bashing in your own way
[11/01/2007 07:13:12 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: maybe I wouldn't get with someone i find ugly but I don't insult them every chance I get cause i know there is someone out there for them who will thing they are gorgeous
[11/01/2007 07:13:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because i am blunt about it doesn't make it any worse then things you say
[11/01/2007 07:13:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and stop acting like you know me
[11/01/2007 07:13:46 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: oh i'm blunt when I want to be mean and bash don't worry
[11/01/2007 07:13:53 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: you just take everything too personally
[11/01/2007 07:14:05 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I don't act like i know you
[11/01/2007 07:14:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahaha you too
[11/01/2007 07:14:17 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I was just saying I really don't want to hear you bash her anymore
[11/01/2007 07:14:25 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: it's getting annoying
[11/01/2007 07:14:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'll be sure to let you know when you get annoying
[11/01/2007 07:14:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and threaten to block you
[11/01/2007 07:14:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i'm sure it means so much to you
[11/01/2007 07:15:22 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: if i'm annoying let me know, i'm not stopping you
[11/01/2007 07:15:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't assume i don't have other options, as if beggers can't be choosers, i am not a begger
[11/01/2007 07:15:42 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: if I bother you there is no point in letting me continue and keeping it to yourself wont' solve the problem
[11/01/2007 07:16:06 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I never said you were but the way you talk about her is like there is nothing else to talk about
[11/01/2007 07:16:12 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: she comes up every time I'm around you
[11/01/2007 07:16:39 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and I know it's your way of joking but i'm just letting you know it's getting old
[11/01/2007 07:16:40 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: is that ok?
[11/01/2007 07:16:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe because you started bring her up, then when we were making fun of her, you stopped
[11/01/2007 07:16:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine
[11/01/2007 07:16:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're not a very good conversationalist

[11/01/2007 07:20:54 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: just cause I asked you to stop making fun of jenna?
[11/01/2007 07:21:17 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: haha, so be it
[11/01/2007 07:22:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: no because it's given me the opportunity to get to know you without being blinded by attraction
[11/01/2007 07:23:27 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: we still bearly know each other though
[11/01/2007 07:23:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know you socially
[11/01/2007 07:23:55 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: we never REALLY get to talk, and our senses of humor are different enough that it makes it hard to communicate
[11/01/2007 07:23:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've seen how you act around me and other people
[11/01/2007 07:24:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the most important thing
[11/01/2007 07:24:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know your favorite color
[11/01/2007 07:25:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of strange that i have a dark sense of humor and generally end up pissing people off, i never imagined there would be someone harder to understand then myself
[11/01/2007 07:26:31 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: well most of the time i'm fine with it, I'm sorry i was stupid and jokingly threatned to block you but like I said the jenna thing is just getting old and I would tell david the same thing if I hear him do it again
[11/01/2007 07:26:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahah ok
[11/01/2007 07:27:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you block me i'll just as well assume you de-aged back to highschool
[11/01/2007 07:28:05 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: hahaha
[11/01/2007 07:28:19 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I prob would have done it for fun
[11/01/2007 07:28:23 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and then undone it
[11/01/2007 07:28:27 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: but oh well
[11/01/2007 07:29:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: was blades of glory and good?
[11/01/2007 07:29:46 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: never saw it
[11/01/2007 07:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's probably going to suck
[11/01/2007 07:30:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you ever know Ryan?
[11/01/2007 07:30:28 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: no
[11/01/2007 07:30:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you missed out
[11/01/2007 07:30:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: he had a dark sense of humor too
[11/01/2007 07:31:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: we used to split the assholery between us

[11/08/2007 09:31:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: the hose has to be long enough to extend outside
[11/08/2007 09:32:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: because we don't have one outside
[11/08/2007 09:32:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no faucet outside

[12/31/2007 04:22:13 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: :P
[12/31/2007 04:22:26 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: it's a guy thing, don't worry
[12/31/2007 04:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i'll completely admit that i didn't treat jenna well, but we both understood the terms from the start of the relationship
[12/31/2007 04:23:53 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: lol we established terms as well
[12/31/2007 04:24:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides i was not physically attracted to her face at all
[12/31/2007 04:24:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are a lot prettier
[12/31/2007 04:25:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but dave is such a square
[12/31/2007 04:25:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am surprised he didn't completely milk the benefits of the relationship for everything
[12/31/2007 04:25:55 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: everything?
[12/31/2007 04:25:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not like he can just go and get another girl
[12/31/2007 04:26:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: very strange
[12/31/2007 04:26:12 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: what do you mean by everything?
[12/31/2007 04:27:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i meant try to continue to the relationship for at least the sex
[12/31/2007 04:27:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe put forth a little effort
[12/31/2007 04:28:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is just a strange guy, i am surprised he cared so little about your relationship to just allow it to dissolve into a friendship
[12/31/2007 04:28:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is all i am saying
[12/31/2007 04:28:23 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: haha, he's not that kind of guy, he doesn't want a romantic relationship he doesn't really want to be in
[12/31/2007 04:28:42 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: well it was always a friendship brian, it was never really a relationship
[12/31/2007 04:28:56 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: we decided we would only be friends with benifits from the start, no attachment
[12/31/2007 04:29:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah
[12/31/2007 04:29:37 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i just happened to eventually start feeling a little more and I brought it up to him telling him we had to stop the physical if we were going to be friends
[12/31/2007 04:30:10 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and I think at times he does want a romantic relationship with me and at others he doesn't, he just can't make up his mind
[12/31/2007 04:30:35 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and if he doesn't truly like me and i'm not what he is looking for then there is no point in getting into a relationship if both parties arn't going to put there all into it
[12/31/2007 04:31:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm, well he never talks to me, i hope you find someone that can give you the kind of relationship you want
[12/31/2007 04:32:05 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: meh i dunno if i really am to keen on getting stuck into another relationship either...i have commitment issues (not like not being able to be faithful I would never cheat on someone), like i hate the feeling of being trapped
[12/31/2007 04:33:03 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: but we have developed a pretty good freindship spending all this time together and we do have a lot in common so neither of us want to lose our friendship :)
[12/31/2007 04:33:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: seems to be an increasingly common mentality towards relationships these days
[12/31/2007 04:33:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you ever think back on events in your life and try to understand how they affected who you are today?
[12/31/2007 04:33:44 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: meh, i think it's just our age group.  None of us are really ready to get TOO serious yet and start thinking about marriage
[12/31/2007 04:34:23 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i'm sure I'll get to a point and find a person that I will be happy to be trapped with, and won't have  the fear of commitment caus ei'm ready to get married
[12/31/2007 04:34:36 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i'm not ready to start thinking about marriage right now,  I enjoy my freedom to much
[12/31/2007 04:34:41 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i will be someday though
[12/31/2007 04:35:05 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and yes to your question
[12/31/2007 04:36:01 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: mainly about being a military brat and how it has broadened my horizons, and opened my eyes to the rest of the world
[12/31/2007 04:36:08 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and hardened me having to move around all the time
[12/31/2007 04:36:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol watching rachel ray with some youngins getting married
[12/31/2007 04:37:11 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: haha

[12/31/2007 04:41:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know where Dave bought his Wii?
[12/31/2007 04:41:32 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: umm no idea he didn't buy it, it was a present from his parents
[12/31/2007 04:41:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah

[12/31/2007 04:44:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: they made a mistake and i had to pay for it
[12/31/2007 04:46:12 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: but if there is nothing wrong with it then you should be able to return it if you have the receipt
[12/31/2007 04:46:31 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: usually every store has a so many day return policy

[03/02/2008 04:09:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so your going to use the "i'm very protective of my friends" bullshit excuse?
[03/02/2008 04:10:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: Because i that is the case, then i am absolutely not your friend.
[03/02/2008 04:10:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can't be protective of one friend while hurting another
[03/02/2008 04:10:24 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: good point
[03/02/2008 04:10:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if we are not friends i don't want to hang out with you
[03/02/2008 04:10:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: or talk to you
[03/02/2008 04:10:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: or see you
[03/02/2008 04:10:39 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I dunno, I was drunk when I left that message
[03/02/2008 04:10:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: or have you show up at our place unannounced
[03/02/2008 04:10:56 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: but it bothered me you calling her stupid
[03/02/2008 04:11:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i guess drunkenness is an acceptable excuse
[03/02/2008 04:11:13 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: not really
[03/02/2008 04:11:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: she wasn't hurt by it, and i knew that, she knows i love her
[03/02/2008 04:11:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but didn't you learn to not hit people in like 1st grade?
[03/02/2008 04:11:46 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: yeah she was a little bothered by it 
[03/02/2008 04:11:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it wasn't so much the slap as it was the principle of it
[03/02/2008 04:12:02 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: just cause she doesn't let you guys see it doesn't mean it doesnt hurt her
[03/02/2008 04:12:32 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: cause if it was keifer you wouldn't have said it
[03/02/2008 04:12:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well then it should be worked out between her and I, not you
[03/02/2008 04:12:40 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and I doubt you would have said i tto me either
[03/02/2008 04:12:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would have said it if it was keifer
[03/02/2008 04:12:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i definitely would have said it to you
[03/02/2008 04:13:00 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: yeah well if you hadn't noticed she kinda avoids conflict and doesn't really bring those things up
[03/02/2008 04:13:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that's no excuse to react the way you did
[03/02/2008 04:13:39 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: well I said I was sorry for my overreaction but I'm not going to sit here and grovel for your forgiveness
[03/02/2008 04:13:52 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I realize what I did wrong and it would be nice if you did too
[03/02/2008 04:13:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't expect you to
[03/02/2008 04:13:53 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: but whatever
[03/02/2008 04:13:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's why i said we aren't friends
[03/02/2008 04:14:06 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: cause I wont' grovel?
[03/02/2008 04:14:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, because of the way you act
[03/02/2008 04:14:45 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: ok
[03/02/2008 04:15:26 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I don't really like the way you act either a lot of the time so if that is ample reason to not be friends so be it
[03/02/2008 04:15:40 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and I havn't showed up at your place unannounced since like the beg of this semester
[03/02/2008 04:16:13 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: I'm sorry you feel this way

[01/14/2009 09:10:25 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i would say abe to, but then we would have to make something specifically vegetarian
[01/14/2009 09:10:34 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and then that would lead to ryan being invited
[01/14/2009 09:10:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[01/14/2009 09:10:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't like ryan?

[01/14/2009 09:13:55 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: it was kinda sad, I didn't let it ruin my fun but there was quite a few people there, so it was easy for him to avoid me
[01/14/2009 09:14:33 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: and having to cook specific to one persons vege needs...
[01/14/2009 09:14:47 PM] Katrina Blackwelder: i love abe to death but when he is the only vegetarian it's a pain
[01/14/2009 09:15:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
