[01/04/2008 03:05:08 PM] Zach MItchell: moldy cheese is good for infection
[01/04/2008 03:05:25 PM] Zach MItchell: i think that should be the first thing you do when you get to flag
[01/04/2008 03:05:36 PM] Zach MItchell: just slam both pieces of moldy cheese in your mouth
[01/04/2008 03:06:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
