[06/23/2007 09:14:53 PM] Keifer Street: I guess its a bit that too, but I think its just because she's a woman and she's weak willed
[06/23/2007 09:15:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: she wakes up at 3 PM and sits around watching TV, then makes noise after Dave and I have gone to bed until about 2 AM

[06/23/2007 09:19:58 PM] Keifer Street: Nice
[06/23/2007 09:20:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: each set is contained in a zip file and the script extracts it as you view it, each zip file is about 200 to 400 MB in size
[06/23/2007 09:20:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are like 10 thousand sets, including videos

[08/20/2007 01:48:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am trying to create a 4 TB sparse file to share on dc++

[08/20/2007 01:54:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: got it
[08/20/2007 02:03:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol this is awesome
[08/20/2007 02:03:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to share 8 TB on the hub
[08/20/2007 02:03:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: so funny
[08/20/2007 02:03:33 AM] Keifer Street: Well... not precicely, but it is funny
[08/20/2007 02:03:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the admin knows me, so hes not going to ban me for it
[08/20/2007 02:04:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: not precisely?
[08/20/2007 02:04:49 AM] Keifer Street: Well, you are sharing 8TB, but you don't have 8TB worth of data
[08/20/2007 02:05:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah thats the point
[08/20/2007 02:05:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol when people look at stuff to download from me they are going to see foo, foo2, foo3, foo4, foo4, foo6, foo7, foo8
[08/20/2007 02:05:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: ahahahaha
[08/20/2007 02:05:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: 1  TB each
[08/20/2007 02:06:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: dc++ sux
[08/20/2007 02:06:19 AM] Keifer Street: Are larger drives slower in performance?  
[08/20/2007 02:06:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: it should hash the files until you request them
[08/20/2007 02:06:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: *shouldn't has them until you request them
[08/20/2007 02:06:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: fucking dc
[08/20/2007 02:06:48 AM] Keifer Street: I was thinking of getting an iMac with either a 500GB or 1TB worth of storage space
[08/20/2007 02:06:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: my program is better
[08/20/2007 02:07:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: it depends on the drive stats
[08/20/2007 02:07:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: size doesn't matter
[08/20/2007 02:07:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: filesystem does
[08/20/2007 02:07:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: and drive stats
[08/20/2007 02:07:46 AM] Keifer Street: Yeah I figured, but Mac isn't exactly the best place to find drive stats on their hardware
[08/20/2007 02:07:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: if it says like .04ms seek rate and sata II then it will be fast
[08/20/2007 02:08:50 AM] Keifer Street: Do they even have 1TB drives out?
[08/20/2007 02:09:33 AM] Keifer Street: On the Mac Website it says you can order an iMac with a 1TB Serial ATA drive, but I thought the largest was 750GB
[08/20/2007 02:11:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: nope
[08/20/2007 02:11:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: might be raided too
[08/20/2007 02:11:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: apple sux like that
[08/20/2007 02:16:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: so uh fuck dc++ 
 server crashed last year because of too much fucking hashing 
 if you want kool appz talk to me online 
 server admin (HeWasAJumperBoy) can get in touch with me or PM me 
  
 actual share size probably around 1.5TB (and growing) 
  
 here's some stats (estimated): 
  
 Music = 80GB 
 DVDs = 600GB (100 on HDs, 340 shrunk and burned) 
 Videos = 100GB (ASSorted tv shows) 
 Pr0n = 500+GB (Met-Art.com, etc., looking for 500GB hard drives to download entire websites) 
 Appz = 200GB (Almost everything you can imagine, Adobe CS 3 too!)

[08/29/2007 12:29:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: at first i thought she was a bad person for messing around with that guy like you suggested
[08/29/2007 12:30:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i agreed with you, but now i've come to realize shes not just a bad person, she is incredibly immature
[08/29/2007 12:32:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: it really is sad to see

[09/17/2007 06:05:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: just wondering
[09/17/2007 06:05:50 PM] Keifer Street: uh huh...
[09/17/2007 06:05:53 PM] Keifer Street: Okay
[09/17/2007 06:05:55 PM] Keifer Street: well
[09/17/2007 06:06:27 PM] Keifer Street: I get along with her extremely well; most of our interactions have been scholastic, but even under those gruel circumstances she is great to be around
[09/17/2007 06:07:12 PM] Keifer Street: We have common interests like video games, a similar taste in movies (except maybe Mrs. Doubtfire) and she has the best taste in music (in comparison to me) out of anyone I have ever met
[09/17/2007 06:07:16 PM] Keifer Street: Also
[09/17/2007 06:07:42 PM] Keifer Street: She is an Accounting major and is knowledgeable in CIS like me, which leads to great future career interests/potential for a relationship
[09/17/2007 06:08:12 PM] Keifer Street: oh
[09/17/2007 06:08:17 PM] Keifer Street: and I also find her very attractive
[09/17/2007 06:08:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you suck at CIS
[09/17/2007 06:08:23 PM] Keifer Street: (but that's the least important)
[09/17/2007 06:08:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie
[09/17/2007 06:08:37 PM] Keifer Street: Compared to you, but CIS isn't all about programming
[09/17/2007 06:08:47 PM] Keifer Street: You have to know AIS to be able to do CIS
[09/17/2007 06:08:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not all about programming
[09/17/2007 06:09:36 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah, I thought that movie was ok, but definately not the greatest movie I've ever seen by a long shot
[09/17/2007 06:09:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol probably not
[09/17/2007 06:11:07 PM] Keifer Street: I still think 300/Bravehart/Lord of the Rings/Matrix series and quite a few others hold that spot
[09/17/2007 06:11:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/17/2007 06:11:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and armegeddon
[09/17/2007 06:12:56 PM] Keifer Street: idk, Jenna used to be a lot more, well... quite last year and after she duped that one guy she seems to have grown a lot
[09/17/2007 06:13:18 PM] Keifer Street: and I have to say, I am very impressed
[09/17/2007 06:13:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i've noticed a pretty big difference
[09/17/2007 06:44:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have a party playlist now
[09/17/2007 06:44:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like steve
[09/17/2007 06:46:06 PM] Keifer Street: Did you include, "Ice Icy Baby"
[09/17/2007 06:46:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[09/17/2007 06:46:16 PM] Keifer Street: or "Safety Dance"
[09/17/2007 06:46:34 PM] Keifer Street: or "Come on Eileen"
[09/17/2007 06:46:42 PM] Keifer Street: lol
[09/17/2007 06:51:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: any more suggestions?
[09/17/2007 06:52:02 PM] Keifer Street: Well, da black music is always popular at parties
[09/17/2007 06:52:32 PM] Keifer Street: you should google that shit to find out the top party songs to put them in your playlist

[09/17/2007 11:10:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you smoked weed before?
[09/17/2007 11:10:32 PM] Keifer Street: too expensive, boring, and I wanna keep up my track record

[09/17/2007 11:11:26 PM] Keifer Street: what made you wanna get high?
[09/17/2007 11:11:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know its addictive but if we do it together we can help each other not make it a habit

[09/17/2007 11:12:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think my dad does it a lot

[09/17/2007 11:13:44 PM] Keifer Street: I know what you mean, Its not that bad drug wise, I just don't see the point
[09/17/2007 11:13:56 PM] Keifer Street: dude I have a lot of homework to do
[09/17/2007 11:14:04 PM] Keifer Street: I would talk about it more, but I really need to get this done
[09/17/2007 11:14:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just want to try it sometime before college is up, just like most college kids, i don't think i know anyone who hasn't tried it
[09/17/2007 11:15:18 PM] Keifer Street: well just because everybody tries it doesn't mean its great, or that you have to try
[09/17/2007 11:15:36 PM] Keifer Street: you can stand out as a rebel by NOT doing it
[09/17/2007 11:15:42 PM] Keifer Street: like me
[09/17/2007 11:15:52 PM] Keifer Street: I mean drinking is enough to get me by

[10/09/2007 11:47:14 PM] Keifer Street: I just finished
[10/09/2007 11:48:48 PM] Keifer Street: Brian, I sent the e-mail telling you that I forgave you.  Look, I dont care about the movie, and even if I was talking in an annoying frequency, I just didn't like the way you asked us to be quiet - "Gosh you guys are so annoying shut the fuck up"... I don't like my friends to talk to me that way
[10/09/2007 11:54:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok that isn't what i said so you don't need to put it in quotes
[10/09/2007 11:54:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: but where did you ever get the idea that it was ok to talk during movies?
[10/09/2007 11:55:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: did people just never say "shhh" to you when you were a child?
[10/09/2007 11:55:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you were growing and watching movies with your dad and sister, did they ever tell you to be quite?
[10/09/2007 11:55:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i have never met someone that talks as much as you do during movies
[10/09/2007 11:55:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: never
[10/09/2007 11:55:56 PM] Keifer Street: Dude, I was talking to Jenna yesterday and she told me you were talking up a storm with her during "Good Luck Chuck"

[10/10/2007 12:01:43 AM] Keifer Street: Also, it really hurt my feelings when you told me that you constantly purposefully not included me in some of the things you did last year
[10/10/2007 12:02:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i felt like you deserved to know
[10/10/2007 12:02:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was mostly movie events
[10/10/2007 12:02:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: just because of your habits
[10/10/2007 12:03:08 AM] Keifer Street: Ok, well I don't want to be that guy in the group that everyone has around just to make fun of and hate... like fandy, I will not be a fandy
[10/10/2007 12:03:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: we don't make fun of you or hate you
[10/10/2007 12:03:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are just not fun to watch movies with
[10/10/2007 12:03:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: because you take everyone else's experience into your own hands
[10/10/2007 12:04:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you narrate and state your opinions about the movie every chance you get
[10/10/2007 12:04:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i remember that time we watched what dreams may come, you could stop saying how sacrilegious it was
[10/10/2007 12:04:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: and because of your pre-judgments about the story, i think you missed the point of it
[10/10/2007 12:06:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think joanna is the only one that will defend your stance on movies being entirely social, and it's just because she's your girlfriend
[10/10/2007 12:06:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, i've never met someone with that point of view before
[10/10/2007 12:06:30 AM] Keifer Street: Here's my point Brian... I sent you that e-mail... all I said was an apology and that I was in the wrong, submitting to your argument and making an inadvertent agreement that I may talk to much during movies, but the e-mail I got back wasn't apologetic at all, it sounded more scornful and mean
[10/10/2007 12:07:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i am not sorry for being angry with you
[10/10/2007 12:07:40 AM] Keifer Street: Nor the way you talked to us
[10/10/2007 12:07:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe the most important thing you need to learn from this experience is just because you appologize doesn't make what you did OK, especially not ok to repeat
[10/10/2007 12:08:20 AM] Keifer Street: Maybe what you need to realize Brian is that you can't talk to people anyway you want and not expect to hurt them or have negative consequences... think before you speak
[10/10/2007 12:08:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: and we have had this argument before, and there was yelling involved, and you continue to bother people
[10/10/2007 12:09:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: you're right, i support your idea that taking a well though out approach to every disagreement is the right way to do things
[10/10/2007 12:09:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i would have been more then happy to discuss it with you more calmly if this was the first occurrence 
[10/10/2007 12:10:09 AM] Keifer Street: I can aknowledge that some of the things I said, especially after the film, were in anger and my conscience felt bad, but here you're saying that you're still not sorry for anything
[10/10/2007 12:10:47 AM] Keifer Street: How do you think that makes me feel... even if I was in the wrong Brian people have to humble themselves for the sake of friendship sometiems, which is what I tried to do by apologizing
[10/10/2007 12:11:01 AM] Keifer Street: I really don't care about the whole talking during a movie argument at this moment
[10/10/2007 12:11:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: I have no problem admitting when i am wrong.  but the fact is, sometimes people yell, i don't think the volume level and tone of my voice should determine the quality of what is said
[10/10/2007 12:12:18 AM] Keifer Street: It wasn't the tone of what you said, it was the content that was hurtful
[10/10/2007 12:12:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if you have a problem with yelling then maybe you don't have a very thick skin, but i will stand by what i said the other night, i thought you were being selfish and condescending towards me, and at the time you were being an asshole
[10/10/2007 12:13:05 AM] Keifer Street: Look, Joanna was hurt too, its not just me being a sensitive pussy
[10/10/2007 12:13:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe that makes me an asshole too, but i still have a valid point, people don't want to listen to you talk during a movie
[10/10/2007 12:13:25 AM] Keifer Street: and we both know that Joanna and I are not the first one's you've hurt by saying something brash
[10/10/2007 12:14:03 AM] Keifer Street: Even if I did disagree with you, after the film, I still didn't talk to you the way you talked to me... especially that nasty text message you sent
[10/10/2007 12:14:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: she was hurt because i yelled at her too, because i think you were both trying to defend an absolutely ridiculous ideal, and i made my opinions known to you
[10/10/2007 12:15:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if i am brash, then what is "your loss"
[10/10/2007 12:15:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: pompous?
[10/10/2007 12:15:26 AM] Keifer Street: What am I supposed to say when my friend tells me that he never wants to see a movie with me... "oh sweet, that's awesome"?
[10/10/2007 12:15:59 AM] Keifer Street: I said "your loss"... you said... and I quote... "My loss that you annoy the fuck out of me"
[10/10/2007 12:16:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should say something constructive like you'll consider my point of view, maybe take a survey of people that agree with me or you
[10/10/2007 12:16:21 AM] Keifer Street: Does that sound constructive to you?
[10/10/2007 12:16:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was quite annoyed, i can't apologize for that
[10/10/2007 12:18:04 AM] Keifer Street: Listen Brian, if you won't give in and apologize from anything, the way you talked, the way you hurt us, the fact that you may have been angry and didn't mean to say things in a certain way... then our friendship is much thinner than I thought
[10/10/2007 12:18:35 AM] Keifer Street: Even if your point wins...
[10/10/2007 12:18:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like if i give you an apology you will be free to make these same mistakes again
[10/10/2007 12:18:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: and everything i said will go right out the other ear like it usually does
[10/10/2007 12:19:35 AM] Keifer Street: When two people argue, one person is always usually right, or at least, partially right... but when two people argue, they say things (or mayb say them in a way) that they don't mean and good friends apologize for those things down the road... they forgive eachother...
[10/10/2007 12:20:14 AM] Keifer Street: To me, it seems that you don't want to budge a nonometer in forgiveness or apology about anything
[10/10/2007 12:20:17 AM] Keifer Street: *nano
[10/10/2007 12:21:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't think you care enough about what i had to say to take it to heart
[10/10/2007 12:21:19 AM] Keifer Street: Do you honestly beleive that I'm still going over the argument in my head... trying to get you to see my point??? I could give a shit, I don't really care anymore about that
[10/10/2007 12:21:36 AM] Keifer Street: My disdain has nothing to do with the movie anymore
[10/10/2007 12:22:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: you can't just expect an apology from everyone, you have to deserve it
[10/10/2007 12:22:51 AM] Keifer Street: I agree... and as your friend I believe I deserve an apology for the way you talked to me and my girlfriend
[10/10/2007 12:23:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll apologize for the things i didn't mean when you accept the things that i did mean
[10/10/2007 12:25:17 AM] Keifer Street: I acknowledge the things that you said, if that's what you're referring to.  Brian really dislikes it when people talks during movies, and also beleives that everyone in the world (or most of the people) agree with him -- noted.  But can't two people still get along even though they can 'agree to disagree'?
[10/10/2007 12:25:45 AM] Keifer Street: If everyone agreed on everything friendship and love would be really boring
[10/10/2007 12:25:58 AM] Keifer Street: That's what creates a unique individual
[10/10/2007 12:26:15 AM] Keifer Street: Also important to note here is the difference between a beleif and a behavior
[10/10/2007 12:26:38 AM] Keifer Street: I can still beleive that its ok to talk during movies, but that doesn't mean that I can't control my behavior of doing so in the future
[10/10/2007 12:31:13 AM] Keifer Street: To me, it seems a waste that anybody would let a disgagreement about something so nominal destroy the foundations of a relationship -- once you get to a certain point, if the two parties can't agree on an issue its best just to acknowledge the other's beleif and behave accordingly when you're with them... like disagreements in religion
[10/10/2007 12:31:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's deeper then that
[10/10/2007 12:32:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: the point is i asked you not to do it before and you continue to
[10/10/2007 12:34:12 AM] Keifer Street: Look, all you had to say was something along the lines of (either in the movie or after)... I have talked to you many times about this and it really annoys me that you haven't followed through, but I really dislike it when people talk during movies and I beleive the people around me do as well... 
[10/10/2007 12:34:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't like how you talk down to me
[10/10/2007 12:36:05 AM] Keifer Street: I'm sorry if it seems that way, I don't mean to patronize you or talk to you as if you were less intelligent, that wasn't my aim... it was to try to convey to you how I feel
[10/10/2007 12:48:26 AM] Keifer Street: Alright... well, if you respond later, its not that i'm ignoring you, but that I started playing WoW for my overnight... if you wanna talk about this more, we can talk about it tomorrow

[03/30/2008 05:17:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[03/30/2008 05:18:32 PM] Keifer Street: I was going to reformat my computer to put 64 bit vista on... I needed somewhere to backup my documents/pictures/and WoW folder... my DVD burner isn't working atm and I was wondering if there was a way I could put the folders on your server for an hour or so
[03/30/2008 05:19:08 PM] Keifer Street: Shouldn't be more than about 8 or 9 Gigs
[03/30/2008 05:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah no problem
[03/30/2008 05:21:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can backup everything i have plenty of space
[03/30/2008 05:21:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: is this your laptop?
[03/30/2008 05:21:39 PM] Keifer Street: yeah
[03/30/2008 05:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you want to bring the hard drive over we can hook it up to my desktop
[03/30/2008 05:22:59 PM] Keifer Street: Well... I really only need to backup my media and WoW folder... everything else can be installed... 
[03/30/2008 05:24:04 PM] Keifer Street: So... do I need to bring my laptop over or can we do it over the network?
[03/30/2008 05:24:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: we can try over the network
[03/30/2008 05:24:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will take a long time though
[03/30/2008 05:25:34 PM] Keifer Street: Ok, I'll give it a shot, I'll try and transfer the smaller folders first... my pictures, music, and video... shouldn't be more than 1GB
[03/30/2008 05:25:46 PM] Keifer Street: my WoW folder takes up most of the sace... about 8GB
[03/30/2008 05:27:45 PM] Keifer Street: How do I connect?  What info do I need to know?
[03/30/2008 05:28:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will give you ftp info
[03/30/2008 05:28:15 PM] Keifer Street: kk
[03/30/2008 05:37:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: so in windows explorer open (Link: ftp://guest@209.250.30.30/)ftp://guest@209.250.30.30/ in the address bar
[03/30/2008 05:37:45 PM] Keifer Street: ok
[03/30/2008 05:38:15 PM] Keifer Street: any password?
[03/30/2008 05:38:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: guestpass
[03/30/2008 05:40:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: working ok?
[03/30/2008 05:40:19 PM] Keifer Street: so far so good
[03/30/2008 05:41:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can use up to 83 gigs
[03/30/2008 05:41:48 PM] Keifer Street: Ok, but that won't be necessary; all of the content on my hardrive doesn't top 77 GB; I'll only need to copy over about 10
[03/30/2008 05:48:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: how fast is it going?
[03/30/2008 05:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: has it errored out yet?
[03/30/2008 05:49:04 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah, once, but I just recopied the folder it errored on
[03/30/2008 05:49:09 PM] Keifer Street: No connection info though
[03/30/2008 05:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[03/30/2008 05:53:03 PM] Keifer Street: "An error occured copying a file to the FTP Server.  Make sure you have permission to put files on the server.  Details:  The connection with the server was reset"
[03/30/2008 05:54:40 PM] Keifer Street: Should I just bring my laptop over then?
[03/30/2008 05:54:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless you want to keep recopying
[03/30/2008 05:55:06 PM] Keifer Street: I've been trying to backup 8G's worth of data for the past 4 hours with no success...
[03/30/2008 05:55:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you know if you can get the hard drive out of it?
[03/30/2008 05:55:51 PM] Keifer Street: No, but I could probably figure it out... or at the very least, bring it over and take it out
[03/30/2008 05:56:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah just bring it over
[03/30/2008 05:56:26 PM] Keifer Street: be there in a bout 10 min

[04/23/2008 08:41:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what did she say?
[04/23/2008 08:41:29 PM] Keifer Street: Well that's it, we sit together as partners in class and she didn't really say much... in fact, she started crying for no reason
[04/23/2008 08:41:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wtf
[04/23/2008 08:41:44 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah idk

[04/23/2008 08:43:01 PM] Keifer Street: Speaking of women, I'm sorry for that whole Crystal thing... that was a bid off on my part
[04/23/2008 08:43:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats maybe a third of what i wanted to talk to you about
[04/23/2008 08:43:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: read my blog and you'll get another third
[04/23/2008 08:43:47 PM] Keifer Street: Not to mention my gf, the fact the she also had a boyfriend made it very douchebagish to flirt with her
[04/23/2008 08:44:20 PM] Keifer Street: What's the first third?
[04/23/2008 08:44:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nvm
[04/23/2008 08:44:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we will get there

[04/23/2008 08:46:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: she's so weird
[04/23/2008 08:47:06 PM] Keifer Street: Well, to be honest, I was afraid to ask because I felt that I was somehow involved
[04/23/2008 08:47:21 PM] Keifer Street: I didn't wanna make things worse, so I just walked back with her to her car from class
[04/23/2008 08:47:33 PM] Keifer Street: In absolute silence
[04/23/2008 08:48:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol

[04/23/2008 08:48:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe she has herpes
[04/23/2008 08:48:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: have you ever had sex with her?
[04/23/2008 08:48:51 PM] Keifer Street: No
[04/23/2008 08:49:03 PM] Keifer Street: The most I've ever done with her was the time when you were also present
[04/23/2008 08:50:57 PM] Keifer Street: I still find it weird that your first was with her
[04/23/2008 08:51:21 PM] Keifer Street: Esp. after Sophomore year when she liked me... heh
[04/23/2008 08:51:34 PM] Keifer Street: Life is weird sometimes, I guess
[04/23/2008 08:52:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, and my last with her was with her

[04/24/2008 12:32:16 AM] Keifer Street: I saw some chalk writing near Allen the other day on the sidewalk, "Jesus loves her but I think she's a fucking cunt"... in reference to the peace writings further down the road... I thought it might have been you when you guys did your "Rick Rolling"  I found it ot be hilarious
[04/24/2008 12:35:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that was absolutely not us, and that is totally immature to put on a sidewalk
[04/24/2008 12:35:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is something i would have erased
[04/24/2008 12:35:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and probably the jesus thing too
[04/24/2008 12:36:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and the mccain thing

Don't get me wrong, I no longer have any feelings for cyrstal, but it was very unchivalrous of you to do

[04/26/2008 06:30:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so you totally missed the point of the discussion because you are too dense.  i didn't talk with you because of crystal, i talked to you for joanna's sake.
[04/26/2008 06:30:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you don't know the half of it.
[04/26/2008 06:31:13 PM] Keifer Street: that still doesnt make what you did right

[04/26/2008 06:34:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it was going both ways
[04/26/2008 06:34:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: you still should not have hit on anyone since you have a girlfriend

[04/26/2008 06:35:24 PM] Keifer Street: yeah that was why i stopped, i didnt even talk to her at all last night
[04/26/2008 06:35:55 PM] Keifer Street: unlike some
[04/26/2008 06:36:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: ha, stopped hitting on her, i can't wait for the next iteration of your irresponsibility, i will be sure to call you on it
[04/26/2008 06:37:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you really that dense?  you should have stopped because you have a girlfriend, not because she has a boyfriend
[04/26/2008 06:38:21 PM] Keifer Street: that was my reason for stopping, the fact that you didnt stop pissed me off
[04/26/2008 06:38:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like she should have pulled away because she has a boyfriend, i am not saying that what i did was right, but at least it was for the right reasons
[04/26/2008 06:38:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't give a fuck if i pissed you off
[04/26/2008 06:38:53 PM] Keifer Street: what right reason?
[04/26/2008 06:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: she needs me

[04/26/2008 06:40:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are jealous because you made her uncomfortable and she may be attracted to me

[10/01/2008 09:23:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i always liked the approach there companies would create a network of malicious computers just like the malware people, except they would attack the malware servers in order to shut down their control
