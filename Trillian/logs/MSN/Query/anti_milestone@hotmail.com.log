[06/15/2007 02:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm just saying with about 10 thousand dollars of electronics and increasing, it would be a worth investment to have some sort of security system, maybe video surveillance is overkill but there are those crash alarms for when windows break

[08/03/2007 10:52:07 AM] David McArthur: but just to kingman
[08/03/2007 10:52:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: ah, i can't wait to show you my new phone
[08/03/2007 10:52:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: that i can write programs for
[08/03/2007 10:52:41 AM] David McArthur: nice
[08/03/2007 10:52:47 AM] David McArthur: although i hate cell phones
[08/03/2007 10:52:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but you won't hate this one
[08/03/2007 10:53:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are very few things i hate about this one
[08/03/2007 10:53:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i've noticed maybe 1 or 2 bugs, but otherwise, its amazing, it does everything i need it to, and the internet browser on it is pretty decent
[08/03/2007 10:55:24 AM] David McArthur: which phone did you get
[08/03/2007 10:59:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: treo
[08/03/2007 10:59:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: verizon treo with windows mobile 5
[08/03/2007 11:00:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i learned windows mobile 6 and the treo 800 comes out in like six months
[08/03/2007 11:00:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am going to sell this one on ebay and get a new phone or possibly trade it back in
[08/03/2007 11:00:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: which reminds me, i have a 100 dollar rebate
[08/03/2007 11:02:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to sound like a hypocrite because i called keifer a dumbass over getting a new phone, my dad has never bought me a phone when my sister has had one since she was 6 as well as a laptop, so after years of waiting he finally contributes to that, and once again i found a way around paying for my own luxuries
[08/03/2007 11:04:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: good things come to those who wait
[08/03/2007 11:04:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think you will find an amazing girlfriend, because you've waiting so long

[08/07/2007 02:09:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: they said the reason they skip roadwarrior is because a local store doesn't have it, so they check for the stores a little further away if they have it, and if they don't then they go on to movies from closer stores
[08/07/2007 02:10:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: its so that we can get the movies in a day or two, and they don't have to pay a lot for shipping
[08/07/2007 02:10:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they use their local stores as suppliers

[08/14/2007 05:04:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could use web_dav through apache, then you could still authenticate without encryption

[08/15/2007 10:09:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i just had the most amazing idea
[08/15/2007 10:10:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know what would be better then just covering the counter in beer bottles?
[08/15/2007 10:10:38 PM] David McArthur: throwing them away?
[08/15/2007 10:10:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol booooorrrriiiiinnnnggg
[08/15/2007 10:10:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: setting up a camera in slow record, so it speeds it up when you play it back, and recording the entire time it takes us to fill the counter
[08/15/2007 10:11:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be the most popular video on you tube
[08/15/2007 10:11:14 PM] David McArthur: hmmm
[08/15/2007 10:11:21 PM] David McArthur: that might be pretty cool
[08/15/2007 10:11:27 PM] David McArthur: actually
[08/15/2007 10:11:34 PM] David McArthur: we'll need a bigger table though
[08/15/2007 10:11:40 PM] David McArthur: i dont actually want them on the counter
[08/15/2007 10:11:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: we lol why?
[08/15/2007 10:11:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't matter
[08/15/2007 10:11:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: we aren't even using that space
[08/15/2007 10:12:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: we make samiches
[08/15/2007 10:12:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: w/e
[08/15/2007 10:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: my point is, when we have lots more beer, we can set up the camera, we will same a few boxes, and just make it look like we are taking them out of the fridge and drinking them, then come back and put them on the counter
[08/15/2007 10:12:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: just to make the video

[08/16/2007 05:33:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have something to weigh the monitor/
[08/16/2007 05:33:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/16/2007 05:34:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: like a scale?

[08/16/2007 05:34:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to call technical support
[08/16/2007 05:34:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: this acer monitor is only 20 lbs and it says it supports 25 lbs
[08/16/2007 05:35:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the 20 inch is only about 15 lbs
[08/16/2007 05:35:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and both of them are too heavy for it
[08/16/2007 05:35:29 PM] David McArthur: what do you mean too heavy?
[08/16/2007 05:35:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses a hydrolic pump to support the weight
[08/16/2007 05:36:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it can't support that much weight
[08/16/2007 05:36:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: the weight of my monitors that both weight less then what it says it can handle
[08/16/2007 05:37:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it looks pretty cool aside from its failures

[10/02/2007 03:07:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe we should be selective about who to invite to the projector party
[10/02/2007 03:08:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you going to help me construct the screen and shelves?
[10/02/2007 03:08:50 PM] David McArthur: I might have time thursday
[10/02/2007 03:09:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i might go today to find materials
[10/02/2007 03:09:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have to get a hose to clean stuff
[10/02/2007 03:10:23 PM] David McArthur: so i was thinking
[10/02/2007 03:10:57 PM] David McArthur: we'll have to mount it pretty high so we are not in the way of the projector if we want to use teh WII
[10/02/2007 03:11:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but then we risk the fan being in the way
[10/02/2007 03:11:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we might have to wait to build the shelf like friday after we get the projector
[10/02/2007 03:11:39 PM] David McArthur: yeah
[10/02/2007 03:11:42 PM] David McArthur: to see what will work
[10/02/2007 03:11:52 PM] David McArthur: I think we're going to have to do some drilling
[10/02/2007 03:12:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i could look at the lens spec and use some fancy calculus to figure out exactly where it will show on the wall
[10/02/2007 03:12:22 PM] David McArthur: yeah
[10/02/2007 03:12:29 PM] David McArthur: im not sure we'll have enough room either way
[10/02/2007 03:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: to install the shelf we will have to drill
[10/02/2007 03:12:50 PM] David McArthur: might have to move it to shine on the blinds for wii parties
[10/02/2007 03:13:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't remember when zach brought his could people stand infront of it?
[10/02/2007 03:14:52 PM] David McArthur: dont think so
[10/02/2007 03:14:56 PM] David McArthur: we can always angle it somehow
[10/02/2007 03:15:28 PM] David McArthur: do i have a cable jack in my room?
[10/02/2007 03:16:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am at work
[10/02/2007 03:16:20 PM] David McArthur: i thought you might know offhand
[10/02/2007 03:16:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah not sure
[10/02/2007 03:16:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we do the picture frame idea, that will make it a lot more manageable
[10/02/2007 03:16:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we can move the picture frame anywhere
[10/02/2007 03:17:31 PM] David McArthur: you like baseball at all

[10/02/2007 03:33:35 PM] David McArthur: but I would like to keep it that way
[10/02/2007 03:34:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i already have a copy but it requires a crack
[10/02/2007 03:34:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the new windows validation can detect it
[10/02/2007 03:34:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe we should just do sage
[10/02/2007 03:34:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: still have the install CD?
[10/02/2007 03:34:55 PM] David McArthur: no idea

[10/22/2007 05:45:35 PM] David McArthur: why did you get kicked out
[10/22/2007 05:45:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made a slightly aggressive anti-mac joke, a quote from maddox
[10/22/2007 05:46:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: in response to a mac-lover "joke"
[10/22/2007 05:46:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: the "i can't go anywhere without some mac user telling me how great it is" quote
[10/22/2007 05:46:55 PM] David McArthur: and they kicked you out for that?
[10/22/2007 05:46:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was being a "troll"
[10/22/2007 05:47:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was too controversial, and i was too harsh
[10/22/2007 05:48:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the real problem is, i effortlessly managed to piss everyone off because they didn't understand my dark sense of humor
[10/22/2007 05:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i forgot to put smiley emoticons
[10/22/2007 05:48:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i assumed they would understand because they are CS nerds
[10/22/2007 05:50:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it created this whole big argument, and they are incredibly elitist, and despite this internet etiquette that everyone is supposed to follow, they went out of their way to attack me on a more personal level, and i don't want to participate in that double standard, so they banned me from the user group, and i am not going to the meetings anymore
[10/22/2007 05:51:46 PM] David McArthur: lol they actually kicked you out of meetings
[10/22/2007 05:52:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: they kicked me out of the google group that has information on all the meetings, so essentially yes
[10/22/2007 05:52:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean physically i could go and be mis informed on times and locations, but the google group is really essential in participating
[10/22/2007 05:52:58 PM] David McArthur: oh you just saying your not
[10/22/2007 05:54:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: the banned me from the google group, and i don't want to participate in it anymore anyways because they really lashed out at me, instead of disregarded the negative part of my post, they took it to a personal level.  they really are kind of clique-ish
[10/22/2007 05:55:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean Matt has never made any attempt to have a decent conversation with me, despite my attempts.  He was pretty quick to jump the gun when it came to criticizing me, and it was really kind of condescending.
[10/22/2007 05:55:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: It was hurtful
[10/22/2007 05:56:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: Leah asked "Did a Mac like kill your father or something?"  which generally would be funny, but what is someone's father really killed recently, it could have been offensive. But it's OK for them to say offensive things, because they are better then me.
[10/22/2007 05:56:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of a double standard there
[10/22/2007 05:57:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: *what if someone's father was killed recently

[01/23/2008 10:49:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: he does the deving in C# which is almost exactly like Java but with c++ keywords
[01/23/2008 10:49:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's a pretty sweet language and is supported by mono
[01/23/2008 10:50:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you should take a look at it with me and we could make some cool mods to start out
[01/23/2008 10:50:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: then richard will participate
[01/23/2008 10:51:21 AM] David McArthur: hmm
[01/23/2008 10:51:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: he explains how the sensor bar works, the sensor bar doesn't even detect where the wiimote is, the wiimote uses an IR camera to detect where the sensor bar is, then transmits that data back wirelessly
[01/23/2008 10:51:40 AM] David McArthur: yeah
[01/23/2008 10:51:49 AM] David McArthur: i wonder if we could do the wiimote control through java, then use plasmacore to do game stuff with it
[01/23/2008 10:52:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: omg that would be amazing
[01/23/2008 10:52:12 AM] David McArthur: im skeeting myself just thinking of it
[01/23/2008 10:52:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: we could probably port it easily enough, and both johnny lee's stuff and plasma core already use direct x
[01/23/2008 10:52:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: but he lists all the resources right fuckin there
[01/23/2008 10:52:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: for anyone to download

[02/03/2008 04:48:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey if you go to the grocery store sometime before i do, could you check to see if they have carpet deodorant?
[02/03/2008 04:48:54 PM] David McArthur: sure
[02/03/2008 04:49:00 PM] David McArthur: does the carpet smell?
[02/03/2008 04:49:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the vaccuume smells
[02/03/2008 04:49:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think because Steve vacuumed under my sink, and it was probably pretty nasty
[02/03/2008 04:50:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i cleaned the filter once already and the smell went away mostly, but it still doesn't smell fresh and clean, a powdered deodorant would really help
[02/03/2008 04:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i couldn't find any at walmart
[02/03/2008 04:52:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know keifer changed majors?

[02/06/2008 12:19:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: makes pretty sweet syncML software, but there are some major issues
[02/06/2008 12:19:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: like it is object driven instead of content driven
[02/06/2008 12:20:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: for example if i have the same content on my phone and my desktop while i am setting it up, it will actually duplicate all that content in both places, because to the software they are separate objects, but in reality it is the exact same content!
[02/06/2008 12:21:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is very annoying
[02/06/2008 12:21:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: and their bug tracker link is broken

[03/25/2008 09:46:12 PM] David McArthur: yeah?
[03/25/2008 09:46:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have this vairable defined in a let
[03/25/2008 09:46:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i can display the variable with (display xval) just fine
[03/25/2008 09:47:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but when i try to do like (eval 'xval) it doesn't evaluate
[03/25/2008 09:48:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't make sense because eval can evaluate other pairs just fine
[03/25/2008 09:49:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if i define xval globally, the (eval 'xval) works just fine
[03/25/2008 09:49:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so for some stupid reason it can't see it inside the let
[03/25/2008 09:49:35 PM] David McArthur: can you paste the code
[03/25/2008 09:55:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's a little long
[03/25/2008 09:55:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: (define obj1 (let  
                   ((xval 2)

                           (procedure '()) 
                           )  
                       (set! method `(lambda ,(cadr method) ,(caddr method)))

                 ) 
   ) 
 
[03/25/2008 09:56:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it stores the state variables before the lambda so those stay accessible all the time, and it stores the methods after the lambda so that you can't actually make changes to them
[03/25/2008 09:57:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the 3rd let is just my dispatcher function copied into the body
[03/25/2008 09:57:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should come take a look on my screen
[03/25/2008 09:58:10 PM] David McArthur: looks ok to me
[03/25/2008 09:58:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the xval can't be evaluated when it is defined with a let, and i don't understand that

[03/26/2008 10:40:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: on any platform
[03/26/2008 10:40:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: but modify timestamps are functions of the filesystem right? so you could have a filesystem that doesn't support timestamps
[03/26/2008 10:41:25 AM] David McArthur: im sure all or almost all do
[03/26/2008 10:41:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it would be ridiculous to leave that out
[03/26/2008 10:42:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe when my script re-curses through the directories i can have it skip the ones that have the same date as in the database
[03/26/2008 10:43:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: but it goes pretty fast anyways, when it skips over getting the id3 tags it goes through 1000 files every iteration

[04/23/2008 05:31:55 PM] David McArthur: who this time?
[04/23/2008 05:32:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it is also possible that he could be lying about telling joanna what he has done behind her back
[04/23/2008 05:32:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: crystal made it evident to me that they were talking online and he is putting it all on the table
[04/23/2008 05:33:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is making her and undoubtedly steve uncomfortable
[04/23/2008 05:33:34 PM] David McArthur: fuck
[04/23/2008 05:33:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[04/23/2008 05:34:06 PM] David McArthur: it wouldnt really be an intervention
[04/23/2008 05:34:17 PM] David McArthur: just us telling joana hes a douche
[04/23/2008 05:34:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well, you should talk to joanna, and i will talk to keifer
[04/23/2008 05:34:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it needs to be done
[04/23/2008 05:34:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and don't just tell her he's a douche because she won't listen
[04/23/2008 05:35:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i recommend possibly reiterating over some of the major occurences
[04/23/2008 05:36:09 PM] David McArthur: what are you going to tell keifer?
[04/23/2008 05:45:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that he really needs to reevaluate his relationship, and back the fuck off

[04/23/2008 06:18:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: [04/23/2008 06:14:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would certainly be a good party theme, but i am afraid it would make our usual battelstar group uncomfortable
 [04/23/2008 06:14:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but maybe we should do that when we get our hottub, so that everyone ends up naked and wet by the end of it

[06/08/2008 08:53:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so in TV shows that always have "previously on <show>"
[06/08/2008 08:53:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have an algorithm scan the scenes from the first part of the show, and it matches it up with scenes in previous shows
[06/08/2008 08:54:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: then you can assume that the characters in the previous episodes are in the current episode
[06/08/2008 08:54:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: because they always recap so you remember who the characters are
[06/08/2008 08:55:07 AM] David McArthur: hmm

[06/10/2008 05:09:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: true story
[06/10/2008 05:11:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: something about her just irritates me, it's nice to see her sometimes, but when you started bring her around twice a week, the feeling returned
[06/10/2008 05:13:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess it was the same when i was living with keifer, those two are perfect for each other because they both manage to irritate me, i am not usually this irritable, you have to admit that
[06/10/2008 05:15:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know how when you type it shows "<name> is typing a message", then it goes away with no messages, kind of makes you think they don't want to tell you something

[07/28/2008 06:07:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you know the torrent file format?
[07/28/2008 06:08:25 PM] David McArthur: a bit
[07/28/2008 06:09:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: when it comes to multiple files in one torrent, is there a way for a torrent file to request files from other peers even if the total file list is different
[07/28/2008 06:10:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example one person downloads something.mp3 and i download something.mp3, and somethingelse.mp3 can a third person then get something.mp3 from me and the other person?
[07/28/2008 06:11:21 PM] David McArthur: if you both have the same torrent
[07/28/2008 06:12:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there is no way do define like multiple torrents in 1 torrent file?
[07/28/2008 06:13:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: *to
[07/28/2008 06:13:50 PM] David McArthur: pretty sure the answer is no, but im still not quite sure what your asking
[07/28/2008 06:14:27 PM] David McArthur: like you have a torrent for something.mp3, and someone else has a torrent for something_else.mp3 and something.mp3
[07/28/2008 06:14:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/28/2008 06:15:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want a third person to be able to download from both of the others
[07/28/2008 06:15:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though they have different files
[07/28/2008 06:16:27 PM] David McArthur: for your media server i bet, i think i had this same idea everyone could make a torrent of what they want and the files in common would share, the thing is torrent clients will make a SHA hash of the contents of the torrent and use that as an identifier in the bit-torrent protocol, different files in torrents means different hashes, so the clients wouldnt treat them as the same 
[07/28/2008 06:18:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm i guess i could offer the option to create a single torrent file and put (less seeders) next to it, and offer a zip of multiple torrent files for each file and say (more seeders)
[07/28/2008 06:19:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that would encourage people to just download each file separately so that it can be more useful to other people, but they can still download like an entire album with 1 torrent file (semi-useful to others) or make a completely custom list of files to download
[07/28/2008 06:19:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe some of it will automatically select the appropriate method
[07/28/2008 06:21:22 PM] David McArthur: yeh
[07/28/2008 06:21:48 PM] David McArthur: and then when they create it, you create and run a matching torrent on your server so there is at least one seed?
[07/28/2008 06:22:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/28/2008 06:22:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha i am going to make my torrent specification in smarty
[07/28/2008 06:22:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[07/28/2008 06:23:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i am going to make smarty create the torrent files
[07/28/2008 06:23:50 PM] David McArthur: as long has smarty can do md5 hashes of the files
[07/28/2008 06:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can use regular php commands in smarty
[07/28/2008 06:27:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i should also register the torrent with torrentreactor

[07/28/2008 06:30:24 PM] David McArthur: i dont think so, im sure you can find one that you can register torrents with programatically
[07/28/2008 06:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do i need a tracker when i am serving the files off of my website?
[07/28/2008 06:31:49 PM] David McArthur: the tracker tells the peers about each other

[07/29/2008 12:34:06 PM] David McArthur: theres documentation on it
[07/29/2008 12:37:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it only specifies a piece, not pieces, and it must be encoded in binary instead of hex because it looks completely different

[07/29/2008 12:57:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: pieces: string consisting of the concatenation of all 20-byte SHA1 hash values, one per piece (byte string)
[07/29/2008 12:57:45 PM] David McArthur: yeah...
[07/29/2008 12:59:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: so after i define the files, i divide them into piece and sha them together?

[07/29/2008 12:59:40 PM] David McArthur: might vim a torrent and see what sup
[07/29/2008 01:00:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it says just concat them, when i BDecode it the pieces it just one big clusterfuck

[07/29/2008 01:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha yeah i think i got it now
[07/29/2008 01:02:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i divided the pieces count by 20 (the length of the sha) and that is how many pieces bit torrent shows the file having
[07/29/2008 01:04:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: sweet now i just have to figure out how to read in the files, there is a class for BEndcode that accepts an array and encodes it
[07/29/2008 01:07:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the tracker works nice, i added a link to Vuze and it showed up as 1 seeder

[11/20/2008 11:33:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, it's actually really cool, all the header information is at the end of the file
[11/20/2008 11:34:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it must read it in backwards or something
[11/20/2008 11:36:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i didn't want to use OS calls to create zip files and output them because that takes lots of disk space especially if someone wants to download an ISO from my media site, so instead it just uses zip as a container and only streams in a little at a time and outputs it immediately
[11/20/2008 11:37:32 AM] David McArthur: yeah i think you can use a ZipOutputStream to do something similar in java
[11/20/2008 11:39:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, that sounds a lot easier then what i had to do, i had to study the spec and define all the bytes, just like when we were learning the .class specification in CS 200
[11/20/2008 11:39:22 AM] David McArthur: that actually sounds kind of fu
[11/20/2008 11:40:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, CS 200 was really useful in the sense that we as computer scientists can define and decode file specifications.

[12/09/2008 08:14:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i thought of another reason why curly brackets should go on the line after function defs and class defs
[12/09/2008 08:16:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because the code body of the function is like a body of a document, you don't start a paragraph on the same line as the title of it, the function definition is the title that explain what it does.
[12/09/2008 08:16:38 PM] David McArthur: thats true
[12/09/2008 08:16:44 PM] David McArthur: but a curly isnt part of the body of the code
[12/09/2008 08:16:54 PM] David McArthur: its part of the header
[12/09/2008 08:18:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, i would agree that an open curly could be a part of the header just like having <Title>: with a semi colon, but then what is the close curly? the close curly doesn't make any sense, that's like ending your paragraph with a semicolon
 :
[12/09/2008 08:19:21 PM] David McArthur: then are you suggesting that the last curly be on the same line as the body
[12/09/2008 08:19:35 PM] David McArthur: or that the curlys should be indented, i mean if they are part of the body
[12/09/2008 08:20:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm interesting point, it seems as though i am out matched again
[12/09/2008 08:20:53 PM] David McArthur: i feel strongly about curlys 
[12/09/2008 08:21:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, apparently

[12/14/2008 11:51:41 PM] David McArthur: i always had to recreate them with mdadm
[12/14/2008 11:52:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so even if it was set up on another system if you use the --create flag it doesn't ruin it?
[12/14/2008 11:52:55 PM] David McArthur: i dont know which flag it is, but there is one that will --assembly and make the md device without ruining it
[12/14/2008 11:53:00 PM] David McArthur: though its also possible to ruin it
[12/14/2008 11:53:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe putting them back in the wrong order?

[12/14/2008 11:55:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so it won't ruin my raid 1
[12/14/2008 11:55:35 PM] David McArthur: naw

[12/14/2008 11:56:06 PM] David McArthur: every fucking time i redid my server i had to look up the command, never thought to save it
[12/14/2008 11:56:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is an --assemble option that looks like what i want
[12/14/2008 11:57:31 PM] David McArthur: yeah, i think --assemble is right

[12/17/2008 02:24:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: which indicated a capacitor problem, and a power problem
[12/17/2008 02:25:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and not even the power light would come on, if it was the video processor problem the power light would still come on

[12/31/2008 12:03:26 PM] David McArthur: ?
[12/31/2008 12:04:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well some of these movies are remakes and both are available on netflix, generally are they the new movie, or can you think of some that you know the old one is better?
[12/31/2008 12:04:52 PM] David McArthur: not off the top of my head
[12/31/2008 12:10:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wonder if there is some API for netflix that would allow me to add all these movies with a script

[12/31/2008 12:24:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you know if there is a similar command to diff, or an option that makes it show only the things that are in common not the differences?

[01/10/2009 12:05:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it was like 2 bucks
[01/10/2009 12:05:59 PM] David McArthur: what is the retention on your provider
[01/10/2009 12:06:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: giganewz just upgraded to 270
[01/10/2009 12:07:05 PM] David McArthur: days? for binaries?
[01/10/2009 12:07:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: days for binaries yes
[01/10/2009 12:07:16 PM] David McArthur: holy fuck
[01/10/2009 12:07:20 PM] David McArthur: it was like 3 weeks back in the day
[01/10/2009 12:07:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah it was 180 when i signed up
[01/10/2009 12:07:40 PM] David McArthur: theres going to be no bandwidth availabile in our house
[01/10/2009 12:07:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[01/10/2009 12:07:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: please limit it to 200 during the day
[01/10/2009 12:08:01 PM] David McArthur: kk
[01/10/2009 12:08:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or we can set up a box just for downloading
[01/10/2009 12:08:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i can put this on it
[01/10/2009 12:08:12 PM] David McArthur: i might get back into downloading
[01/10/2009 12:08:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need to get gig-e set up everywheres
[01/10/2009 12:09:36 PM] David McArthur: i think so
[01/10/2009 12:10:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 10 connections is more then enough, it runs at full speed on 5, unfortunately, you can log in from 2 different places, but maybe since we are on the same network we will show using the same IP address
[01/10/2009 12:10:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we still would need 2 different connections to get faster then 700KBs
[01/10/2009 12:10:49 PM] David McArthur: lame
[01/10/2009 12:12:33 PM] David McArthur: our connection tops out about there anyway
[01/10/2009 12:12:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[01/10/2009 12:13:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need to set up a bunch of relay servers
[01/10/2009 12:13:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: have different computers on campus download on to externals then we swap them out every day
[01/10/2009 12:13:52 PM] David McArthur: we could do it in the acm room
[01/10/2009 12:13:56 PM] David McArthur: its over ssl
[01/10/2009 12:14:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ya lol
[01/10/2009 12:19:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and they don't throttle port 119 on campus
[01/10/2009 12:19:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was download at 1.5 in the acm room before
[01/10/2009 12:20:18 PM] David McArthur: hmmmmm
[01/10/2009 12:20:53 PM] David McArthur: ill have to start buying harddrives again
[01/10/2009 12:21:13 PM] David McArthur: you downloading any blue ray disks to burn yet?
[01/10/2009 12:30:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not yet, it is essentially just 720p mkvs
[01/10/2009 12:30:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nothing reads the information on them, just the video, so it is useless to download
[01/10/2009 12:31:27 PM] David McArthur: like the ripper doesnt read the info?
[01/10/2009 12:32:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well yeah, everything rips great, but nothing reads menu systems yet
[01/10/2009 12:32:25 PM] David McArthur: the ps3 doesnt?
[01/10/2009 12:32:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or nothing plays it back
[01/10/2009 12:32:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the ps3 does but i would probably have to burn it again, and it might not even play it with the encryption removes
[01/10/2009 12:32:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *removed
[01/10/2009 12:33:20 PM] David McArthur: ah
[01/10/2009 12:33:25 PM] David McArthur: pointless then
[01/10/2009 12:33:44 PM] David McArthur: i wanna hack a 360
[01/10/2009 12:33:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i fully expect it to tell me encryption is removed and that i am a bad person
[01/10/2009 12:34:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ryan has one, are the hard drives replaceable?
[01/10/2009 12:34:22 PM] David McArthur: which ryan
[01/10/2009 12:34:27 PM] David McArthur: dunno
[01/10/2009 12:34:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe just buy a new laptop hard drive and hack it on that
[01/10/2009 12:34:51 PM] David McArthur: the crack the guy i knew had was a firmware update for the dvd drive
[01/10/2009 12:34:57 PM] David McArthur: works on xbox live, etc
[01/10/2009 12:35:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, hardware hacks are so much better, we totally should, my soldering skills are well enough to replace chips
[01/10/2009 12:36:07 PM] David McArthur: no need to do that
[01/10/2009 12:36:14 PM] David McArthur: plug in the harddrive to a computer
[01/10/2009 12:36:20 PM] David McArthur: i mean the DVD drive
[01/10/2009 12:36:23 PM] David McArthur: into the computer 
[01/10/2009 12:36:26 PM] David McArthur: run a firmware update

[01/10/2009 12:37:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: does it allow you to play burned games?
[01/10/2009 12:37:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am sure ryan would let you do that
[01/10/2009 12:37:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ryan woodall

[01/14/2009 03:28:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: zomg i can't sort 100 different albums every day
[01/14/2009 03:28:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this is taking forever!
[01/14/2009 03:33:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: unfortunately now i am less familiar with what i have, since i am adding stuff so fast, i used to be able to tell people yes or no when they asked if i had something, now i am not sure
[01/14/2009 03:38:01 PM] David McArthur: i think we just need an unorganized drop box
[01/14/2009 03:39:42 PM] David McArthur: is dr P the faculty advisor for ACM?
[01/14/2009 03:39:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[01/14/2009 03:39:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes he still is
[01/14/2009 03:39:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but then our drop box will never get organized
[01/14/2009 03:40:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and we will have something just like dave's library
[01/14/2009 03:40:21 PM] David McArthur: well, if we find anything good in it, we copy it over to our stuff
[01/14/2009 03:40:39 PM] David McArthur: thats what ive started doing for music anyway
[01/14/2009 03:40:42 PM] David McArthur: download a lot
[01/14/2009 03:40:49 PM] David McArthur: only import it into itunes if i like it
[01/14/2009 03:41:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nah, the stuff i am doing is really repetitive, i just need some kind of batch processing to happen afterwards
[01/14/2009 03:41:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like fixing fuckin track numbers
[01/14/2009 03:41:39 PM] David McArthur: aah
[01/14/2009 03:41:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wtf, why do people put 1/40 or 2/40 on complete albums!!!1
[01/14/2009 03:42:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: itunes does it i think
[01/14/2009 03:42:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: damnit
[01/14/2009 03:42:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why do you need to know how many songs there are when you have the complete album!
[01/14/2009 03:42:32 PM] David McArthur: i like it that way
[01/14/2009 03:42:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: negative
[01/14/2009 03:42:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: track numbers are supposed to be an integer value! look at the spec for id3
[01/14/2009 03:43:25 PM] David McArthur: oh, i though it was a separate field for the total num
[01/14/2009 03:43:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no, people put it in the track number
[01/14/2009 03:48:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hot
[01/14/2009 03:48:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got it to do the track number reformatting for me!
[01/14/2009 03:48:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this thing supports batch processing too

[01/20/2009 01:26:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for fmt_long did you use bit shifting at all?
[01/20/2009 01:26:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just used divide operations and modulo
[01/20/2009 01:26:32 PM] David McArthur: i dont think so
[01/20/2009 01:26:37 PM] David McArthur: thats how i did it as well
[01/20/2009 01:29:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i might use bit shifting for next one
[01/20/2009 01:29:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fmt_double
[01/20/2009 01:29:46 PM] David McArthur: i definitely did for that one
[01/20/2009 01:50:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how do you deal with the size of double, i keep getting invalid operands to  binary >>
[01/20/2009 01:51:09 PM] David McArthur: used a lot of unsigned long longs
[01/20/2009 01:54:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so did you use uint64_t or is there a pretty name for it?
[01/20/2009 01:55:24 PM] David McArthur: "unsigned long long" is what i used
[01/20/2009 01:55:30 PM] David McArthur: oh yeah, you werent there on friday

[01/21/2009 03:52:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i can automatically update to 2.4

[01/21/2009 03:54:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: about how many albums do you have?  you can find out by getting a total of folders and then subtracting the top level folders which should be artist
[01/21/2009 03:55:28 PM] David McArthur: 3100 ish
[01/21/2009 03:55:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: piece of cake

 40% is music that i will probably never listen to
 30% is filling in artist discography that i already have
 20% is discovering new stuff that i really want to listen to
 10% i throw away because it's too hard to sort

[03/26/2009 12:12:10 PM] David McArthur: Hi folks, 
 
  
 
In case anyone is in need, we have a heads-up from Marketing that they will be sending some server racks to surplus.  The racks will probably be moved out of the State Farm building that they moved to on this coming Monday, so check out Property Surplus in the near future if you’re interested.

[03/26/2009 12:55:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net:  i completely agree
[03/26/2009 12:55:18 PM] David McArthur: we should drill holes and mount them in the closet
[03/26/2009 12:55:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 2 server racks are better then 1
[03/26/2009 12:55:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the racks?
[03/26/2009 12:55:30 PM] David McArthur: yeah

[03/26/2009 12:56:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh right
[03/26/2009 12:56:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah then we could drill holes in that wall and install keystone ethernet ports that go through
[03/26/2009 12:57:10 PM] David McArthur: yep
[03/26/2009 12:57:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be hot
[03/26/2009 12:57:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we wouldn't be able to get around them
[03/26/2009 12:57:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i don't know what we would do about cooling
[03/26/2009 12:58:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we could install an exhaust port on the side
[03/26/2009 12:58:24 PM] David McArthur: we would have to move the shelves and put the rack in the back
[03/26/2009 12:58:32 PM] David McArthur: yeah, you could put a vent/fan on the door
[03/26/2009 12:58:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah how would we get behind it? i don't know if we put the side against the wall would we be able to get around it?
[03/26/2009 12:59:27 PM] David McArthur: good point
[03/26/2009 12:59:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: one other problem though, i wanted to put my desktop on it too, we would have to get VGA/DVI range extenders
[03/26/2009 12:59:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we could have 1 in my room and 1 in the closet

[05/10/2009 11:02:42 PM] David McArthur: n general, hard drive motors work a little like steppers. Your 4-lead motor probably has 3 coils (and "common"), and you get it to spin by applying power to each coil in the correct sequence. A real PITA for anything short of special purpose circuits or a microcontroller.

[07/06/2009 05:45:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well since we all are migrating over to google e-mail are we still going to use CAS to login to the e-mail?
[07/06/2009 05:45:56 PM] David McArthur: yes
[07/06/2009 05:46:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: regardless, can we find a way to tie it into the ACM website
[07/06/2009 05:46:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[07/06/2009 05:46:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can people use CAS to log in to the ACM website, like can CAS return a first and last name along with the successfully logged in ID
[07/06/2009 05:47:46 PM] David McArthur: you get the username from cas, you can then lookup that user through ldap
[07/06/2009 05:47:54 PM] David McArthur: as long as they are not ferpa protected
[07/06/2009 05:49:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm, not sure how to use php with ldap but i am sure it is possible
[07/06/2009 05:49:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also, do you know anything about accessing the listserv with a script?
[07/06/2009 05:49:35 PM] David McArthur: as far as?
[07/06/2009 05:49:52 PM] David McArthur: its all email based isnt it?
[07/06/2009 05:49:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: getting the list of e-mails on it
[07/06/2009 05:49:57 PM] David McArthur: for subscribing and uns
[07/06/2009 05:50:01 PM] David McArthur: oh
[07/06/2009 05:50:03 PM] David McArthur: dunno
[07/06/2009 05:50:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i looked up listserv api and retrieved and enormous manual on it, maybe be as simple as using one of the admins accounts and just grabbing the list of emails, or we might have to do some kind of socket connection
[07/06/2009 05:52:54 PM] David McArthur: there should be a command to send an email to it and it will return the accounts
[07/06/2009 05:58:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, maybe the e-mail has to come from an owner or something
[07/06/2009 05:58:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think it will work
[07/06/2009 05:58:12 PM] David McArthur: yeah yeah
