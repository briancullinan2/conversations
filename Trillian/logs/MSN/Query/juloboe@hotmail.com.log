Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Julie Anderson): Tue Oct 02 22:22:09 2007
[10/02/2007 10:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey, i am glad you came back
[10/02/2007 10:22:29 PM] Julie Anderson: just got home actually
[10/02/2007 10:22:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was just thinking our conversation ended kind of abruptly
[10/02/2007 10:22:50 PM] Julie Anderson: did it?
[10/02/2007 10:23:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just wanted to say a few things
[10/02/2007 10:23:57 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[10/02/2007 10:24:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: you told me you relationship ended with tears
[10/02/2007 10:24:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i can understand you would be cautious about entering another relationship
[10/02/2007 10:24:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i want you to know that i don't expect anything but a friendship
[10/02/2007 10:25:33 PM] Julie Anderson: Good. All I want is friendship.
[10/02/2007 10:25:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really enjoy getting to know you better, you are a fascinating person, and there are so many topics still to explore, but i am grateful that you shared your experience with me, though it was very vague.
[10/02/2007 10:26:28 PM] Julie Anderson: Well, I asked the cry question because I'm curious about people in general, and if they cry.
[10/02/2007 10:26:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is a decent question when getting to know someone
[10/02/2007 10:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i feel like i should return that same courtesy. if there is anything i have learned from relationships it is this.
[10/02/2007 10:27:55 PM] Julie Anderson: it's a decent question? I didn't think so. It was just something I've thought about, something which I imagine most people don't think about
[10/02/2007 10:28:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no guarantee. with my last girlfriend there were times i felt i could spend the rest of my life with her and never grow tired.  but when i realized our interests and passions were pulling us in different directions i knew our relationship would come to an end
[10/02/2007 10:28:20 PM] Julie Anderson: and I like unusual questions. they're more interesting
[10/02/2007 10:29:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree, and it was an unusual question, thats why i think it was entirely appropriate
[10/02/2007 10:29:26 PM] Julie Anderson: ok :D
[10/02/2007 10:29:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's the unusual questions that tell you the most about a person
[10/02/2007 10:30:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but like you, i cried when my last romantic relationship ended
[10/02/2007 10:30:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you can't let that stop you from being open to new relationships
[10/02/2007 10:30:39 PM] Julie Anderson: well actually, I think it officially ended in laughter. But tears preceded and followed the laughter
[10/02/2007 10:31:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, it took me 2 days before it really sunk in
[10/02/2007 10:31:53 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm not closed to new relationships. But I know that I want to move somewhere out of state after I graduate, so I'm definitely uncertain.
[10/02/2007 10:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i too definitely want to move after i graduate
[10/02/2007 10:33:45 PM] Julie Anderson: where do you want to go?
[10/02/2007 10:34:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: not sure, anywhere but where i am now
[10/02/2007 10:34:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think when i do move i will feel the same way
[10/02/2007 10:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mind big cities, but i like the forest too
[10/02/2007 10:34:58 PM] Julie Anderson: why do you want to go somewhere else?
[10/02/2007 10:35:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe LA, maybe NYC, maybe back to ohio, maybe canada
[10/02/2007 10:35:48 PM] Julie Anderson: so many options
[10/02/2007 10:36:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it looks like the projector will be here thursday, you free?
[10/02/2007 10:36:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could get a movie, order a pizza
[10/02/2007 10:37:08 PM] Julie Anderson: I have stuff I need to do before the weekend
[10/02/2007 10:37:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[10/02/2007 10:37:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know one of these days i will stop asking
[10/02/2007 10:38:08 PM] Julie Anderson: are you sure about that?
[10/02/2007 10:38:33 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm a rather busy person, have you noticed?
[10/02/2007 10:38:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you sure you want to take that risk?
[10/02/2007 10:38:52 PM] Julie Anderson: I don't mind risks.
[10/02/2007 10:38:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i noticed, but that's not the point
[10/02/2007 10:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you tell me when you are free
[10/02/2007 10:39:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i will make time for you
[10/02/2007 10:39:59 PM] Julie Anderson: hmmm, let me think about this
[10/02/2007 10:40:24 PM] Julie Anderson: I don't know when I'm free. Things sometimes come up last minute. I'll let you know if I'm bored and want to do something though.
[10/02/2007 10:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to be bored to spend time with a very interested friend
[10/02/2007 10:41:16 PM] Julie Anderson: true
[10/02/2007 10:41:21 PM] Julie Anderson: But it's my choice.
[10/02/2007 10:42:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are difficult
[10/02/2007 10:42:09 PM] Julie Anderson: thank you.
[10/02/2007 10:42:24 PM] Julie Anderson: you are persistent.
[10/02/2007 10:42:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D very ture
[10/02/2007 10:42:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: *true
[10/02/2007 10:42:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are worth all the extra effort
[10/02/2007 10:43:32 PM] Julie Anderson: that certainly makes me feel better after getting a test back today
[10/02/2007 10:43:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: bad grade?
[10/02/2007 10:43:53 PM] Julie Anderson: yes
[10/02/2007 10:44:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's just a test, not the end of the world
[10/02/2007 10:44:46 PM] Julie Anderson: yes, but I wanted to get As this semester, and now it seems that an A is out of reach in 2 of my classes
[10/02/2007 10:45:03 PM] Julie Anderson: but you're right. I don't need straight As.
[10/02/2007 10:45:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: well here is some good motivation...
[10/02/2007 10:45:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you have to retake classes, think of all the extra time i would have to bug you into going on another date with me
[10/02/2007 10:45:57 PM] Julie Anderson: I didn't fail.
[10/02/2007 10:46:14 PM] Julie Anderson: and even if I did fail, I'd still graduate, but without the stats emphasis
[10/02/2007 10:46:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you can still use those grade replacement credits to get more As
[10/02/2007 10:47:06 PM] Julie Anderson: meh. I'd rather just graduate.
[10/02/2007 10:47:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah probably a good idea
[10/02/2007 10:48:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to graduate asap too
[10/02/2007 10:48:30 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm thinking about just getting a job next year. It'd be a nice break from school.
[10/02/2007 10:50:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: in the spring?
[10/02/2007 10:50:16 PM] Julie Anderson: no after I graduate
[10/02/2007 10:50:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, instead of going straight into your masters?
[10/02/2007 10:50:33 PM] Julie Anderson: yeah
[10/02/2007 10:50:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: that could be fun

[10/02/2007 11:08:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are very confusing
[10/02/2007 11:08:20 PM] Julie Anderson: good.
[10/02/2007 11:08:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: earlier you said you would risk me not inviting you over anymore from turning me down all the time, but you won't risk coming to a party that might have drinking to hang out with me?
[10/02/2007 11:09:06 PM] Julie Anderson: correct
[10/02/2007 11:09:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: you said you take risks
[10/02/2007 11:09:40 PM] Julie Anderson: you'll just never understand how my mind works then, eh?
[10/02/2007 11:10:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: given enough time i think i could figure you out, we seem to have a lot in common
[10/02/2007 11:10:40 PM] Julie Anderson: some people are impossible to figure out, no matter what. I don't think I'm that impossible though.
[10/02/2007 11:12:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably not, but it seems pretty impossible to get time to hang out with you
[10/02/2007 11:13:33 PM] Julie Anderson: hmmm, well... I need to get to bed. I'm tired
[10/02/2007 11:13:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright, have a good night

[10/05/2007 02:43:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should swim
[10/05/2007 02:43:51 PM] Julie Anderson: no, I don't actually. But I want to do this triathalon.
[10/05/2007 02:44:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: a triatholon!?
[10/05/2007 02:44:30 PM] Julie Anderson: A mini one
[10/05/2007 02:44:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's awesome
[10/05/2007 02:44:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: biking and running too?
[10/05/2007 02:44:40 PM] Julie Anderson: yep
[10/05/2007 02:45:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are going to be so in shape!
[10/05/2007 02:45:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i had the motivation
[10/05/2007 02:45:40 PM] Julie Anderson: It's not going to be that hard.
[10/05/2007 02:45:44 PM] Julie Anderson: I think.
[10/05/2007 02:45:56 PM] Julie Anderson: And it's in 4 weeks, so I won't be in much better shape than I am now.
[10/05/2007 02:46:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: 4 weeks is enough time to get in shape
[10/05/2007 02:46:40 PM] Julie Anderson: And it's a mini triathlon. 400m swim, 10 mile bike, 3 mile run
[10/05/2007 02:46:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: that will be fun
[10/05/2007 02:48:09 PM] Julie Anderson: Yeah. I was uncertain about it cause I never swim, so I tried swimming today and I think it's do-able
[10/05/2007 02:50:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i hope you have loads of fun
[10/05/2007 02:50:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i will get the motivation to get to the gym more then once a week
[10/05/2007 02:51:15 PM] Julie Anderson: I never go to the gym.
[10/05/2007 02:51:29 PM] Julie Anderson: But now, I'll go to the pool once a week.
[10/05/2007 02:51:41 PM] Julie Anderson: And maybe go for a few saturday morning runs
[10/05/2007 02:52:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would love to join you for a run if you want company
[10/05/2007 02:52:42 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm slow.
[10/05/2007 02:52:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love running, but if i go alone i have to take an MP3 player, and my Zune is heavier then an ipod
[10/05/2007 02:53:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am slow too, but i much rather prefer going with a friend
[10/05/2007 02:53:05 PM] Julie Anderson: So, how was your presentation?
[10/05/2007 02:53:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: boring
[10/05/2007 02:54:31 PM] Julie Anderson: why?
[10/05/2007 02:55:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: people there were higher level then i expected

[10/05/2007 02:58:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, everyone sat in the back and stared at their laptops
[10/05/2007 02:58:36 PM] Julie Anderson: why'd they go just to stare at their laptops?
[10/05/2007 02:58:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what nerds do

[10/12/2007 11:20:01 PM] Julie Anderson: especially when you're the one playing
[10/12/2007 11:20:02 PM] Julie Anderson: :D
[10/12/2007 11:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah when you are playing
[10/12/2007 11:21:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you ever sat through and orchestra concert?
[10/12/2007 11:21:13 PM] Julie Anderson: yep
[10/12/2007 11:21:19 PM] Julie Anderson: I've been to several FSO concerts
[10/12/2007 11:22:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: orchestra is boring, symphony is so much better
[10/12/2007 11:22:29 PM] Julie Anderson: what's the difference?
[10/12/2007 11:25:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: symphony has wind instruments
[10/12/2007 11:25:50 PM] Julie Anderson: well then this was a symphony orchestra concert

[10/12/2007 11:26:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: tell me when it is
[10/12/2007 11:27:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok?
[10/12/2007 11:27:12 PM] Julie Anderson: see, I believe that an orchestra is a group of players including strings and often wind and percussion instruments, while a symphony is a piece composed by someone
[10/12/2007 11:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: does the concert have brass too?
[10/12/2007 11:27:23 PM] Julie Anderson: of course!!!
[10/12/2007 11:27:30 PM] Julie Anderson: the brass had some amazing parts in this concert

[10/12/2007 11:29:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would pay to see you
[10/12/2007 11:30:18 PM] Julie Anderson: I wouldn't. Unless I had someone to go with.
[10/12/2007 11:32:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're in it right?
[10/12/2007 11:32:07 PM] Julie Anderson: because honestly... they are somewhat boring
