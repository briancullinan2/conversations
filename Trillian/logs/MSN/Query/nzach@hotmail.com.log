[06/16/2007 01:55:30 PM] Zach MItchell: blah
[06/16/2007 01:55:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[06/16/2007 01:55:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should use vmware
[06/16/2007 01:57:21 PM] Zach MItchell: i am using vmware
[06/16/2007 01:57:32 PM] Zach MItchell: I've been on vmware since the first beta

[06/16/2007 01:58:03 PM] Zach MItchell: as a present for my feedback on the software
[06/16/2007 01:58:29 PM] Zach MItchell: how are you with linux?
[06/16/2007 01:59:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty good
[06/16/2007 01:59:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can figure stuff out pretty quickly
[06/16/2007 01:59:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took a linux class and got a B like 3 years ago
[06/16/2007 01:59:57 PM] Zach MItchell: lol
[06/16/2007 02:00:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i use it for my own servers
[06/16/2007 02:00:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i've learned enough to not use a GUI at all
[06/16/2007 02:00:34 PM] Zach MItchell: a server should never have a gui
[06/16/2007 02:00:44 PM] Zach MItchell: its just wasted resources
[06/16/2007 02:00:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: even my computer on top of vmware don't have gui
[06/16/2007 02:01:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it would be nice to do a localhost connect to the virtual machines
[06/16/2007 02:01:17 PM] Zach MItchell: yea
[06/16/2007 02:01:24 PM] Zach MItchell: I run my vmware on an xp system
[06/16/2007 02:01:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: the server?
[06/16/2007 02:01:43 PM] Zach MItchell: yea
[06/16/2007 02:01:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i have bigger rocks then you
[06/16/2007 02:01:57 PM] Zach MItchell: because im having it bridge its network with my wireless
[06/16/2007 02:02:08 PM] Zach MItchell: and you definetly don't
[06/16/2007 02:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the linux server is so much better
[06/16/2007 02:02:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: it runs so much more efficiently
[06/16/2007 02:03:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: and what happened to "its just wasted resources"
[06/16/2007 02:03:37 PM] Zach MItchell: did you not read what i typed
[06/16/2007 02:03:54 PM] Zach MItchell: try to make the linux server share internet over a wireless connection
[06/16/2007 02:04:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do that?
[06/16/2007 02:04:30 PM] Zach MItchell: because I'm living with my gfs parents and I can't run lan cables all over there house
[06/16/2007 02:04:44 PM] Zach MItchell: i usually run my server on trustix linux
[06/16/2007 02:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah
[06/16/2007 02:05:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i run lan all over my parents house
[06/16/2007 02:05:26 PM] Zach MItchell: GOD DAMN IT! everytime i tell cups to not install it does anyways
[06/16/2007 02:05:39 PM] Zach MItchell: yes, my parents house i actually wired for cat6 when i lived there
[06/16/2007 02:05:45 PM] Zach MItchell: but this is not my place in the least
[06/16/2007 02:05:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually i just move my server into the office where the modem is
[06/16/2007 02:06:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i set up my own network because i have spare router when i am there
[06/16/2007 02:06:37 PM] Zach MItchell: yea thats how i had mine
[06/16/2007 02:06:44 PM] Zach MItchell: even here i have dual networks
[06/16/2007 02:06:49 PM] Zach MItchell: which are actually both mine
[06/16/2007 02:07:00 PM] Zach MItchell: i keep my servers on a seperate router then my downloading router etc...
[06/16/2007 02:07:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah

[06/16/2007 02:09:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[06/16/2007 02:09:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i want the d-link brand
[06/16/2007 02:11:14 PM] Zach MItchell: i love the fact that I've redone my webserver install so many times now that it takes the time of the install + 4 minutes to get everything up and running
[06/16/2007 02:11:19 PM] Zach MItchell: so less then an hour and my sites are back up
[06/16/2007 02:11:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah dude i got used to reinstalling linux at least 4 times a year, i just copy over my etc directroy
