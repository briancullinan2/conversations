[10/29/2007 09:24:47 PM] Bryan Goldberg: I'm sure there's plenty of others - after all, it is Flagstaff. The original home of the fun loving slut.
[10/29/2007 09:26:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: dave is watching hentai on my projector

[10/29/2007 09:28:10 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Seems like something would be lost with the whole animation thing, although I'm impressed with the talent and imagination of those artists
[10/29/2007 09:28:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's why we call him hentai dave
[10/29/2007 09:28:33 PM] Bryan Goldberg: lol

[10/29/2007 09:29:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: she brought it over
[10/29/2007 09:29:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's like a japanese school girl

[10/29/2007 09:29:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking kinky all the time
[10/29/2007 09:29:43 PM] Bryan Goldberg: How amazing!
[10/29/2007 09:29:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: exactly
[10/29/2007 09:29:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that's not enough for either of them
[10/29/2007 09:30:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but now spending time with her, i am glad dave swooped in for the steel, she bugs the fuck out of me
[10/29/2007 09:30:29 PM] Bryan Goldberg: LOL
[10/29/2007 09:30:56 PM] Bryan Goldberg: She seemed pretty fun for me, but almost a bit too horny. I like a girl to make me work for it a bit more.
[10/29/2007 09:31:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's crazy as hell, she offered a 3 way with me
[10/29/2007 09:31:45 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Bad ratio, once again
[10/29/2007 09:31:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was like fuck no, i don't want me cock slapping dave's
[10/29/2007 09:31:54 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Damn man, you get lots of bad ratio offers
[10/29/2007 09:32:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah what the hell, everyone offers me 3 ways as if i need to get any
[10/29/2007 09:32:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are like 3 girls i could be in any kind of relationship i want, but i have standards
[10/29/2007 09:33:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: this one girl offered me a good ratio 3 way
[10/29/2007 09:33:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said she wanted me to help her experiment
[10/29/2007 09:33:26 PM] Bryan Goldberg: What, is she nasty ugly?
[10/29/2007 09:33:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes pretty good looking
[10/29/2007 09:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: blonde
[10/29/2007 09:33:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of thin

[10/29/2007 09:33:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: that i would smother myself with
[10/29/2007 09:34:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd hit it if my bothers approved of her, they think she's a slut
[10/29/2007 09:35:03 PM] Bryan Goldberg: If she's as hot as you say, I'm fine with her being a slut. Invite her out with us next time. :P
[10/29/2007 09:35:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes in tuscan, but i will do
[10/29/2007 09:36:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd hit it, but like i said, i have standards, i'm not looking for a virgin to break in, but like you said i want them to make me work for it
[10/29/2007 09:36:20 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Hey, breaking them in is great
[10/29/2007 09:36:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: she seems a little too easy, maybe it's just because she wants my nuts
[10/29/2007 09:36:35 PM] Bryan Goldberg: They worship your Johnson permanently
[10/29/2007 09:36:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: well that would be fine too, but i just don't want a girl that will throw herself at me
[10/29/2007 09:37:38 PM] Bryan Goldberg: I'm up for that right now. I've been living like a monk through the end of law school and the bar exam
[10/29/2007 09:37:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice
[10/29/2007 09:37:55 PM] Bryan Goldberg: No, not nice :P
[10/29/2007 09:38:07 PM] Bryan Goldberg: I want to sue law school for loss of consortium
[10/29/2007 09:38:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, she is an instant message away from fucking me, i'm sure it wouldn't take a fellow like you much work

[10/29/2007 09:50:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't want to ask this chick if she drank last weekend and sound like a dumbass

[01/13/2008 09:40:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: dave and i have been playing video games like mad
[01/13/2008 09:40:49 PM] Bryan Goldberg: right on!
[01/13/2008 09:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: he got a wii and i got a PS3
[01/13/2008 09:41:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: with full backwards compatibility
[01/13/2008 09:42:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: the PS3 is so much hotter then the wii
[01/13/2008 09:42:47 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Holy crap
[01/13/2008 09:42:55 PM] Bryan Goldberg: That's awesome
[01/13/2008 09:43:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah you guys should come back and play video games
[01/13/2008 09:44:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: we really don't mind having you
[01/13/2008 09:44:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: the fart smell wore off pretty soon after you left
[01/13/2008 09:44:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: *you guys
[01/13/2008 09:44:34 PM] Bryan Goldberg: LOL
[01/13/2008 09:44:50 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Those big guys can sure incubate an awful smell
[01/13/2008 09:44:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/13/2008 09:44:59 PM] Bryan Goldberg: They're WMDs
[01/13/2008 09:45:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/13/2008 09:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: they should use that smell in the war
[01/13/2008 09:45:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: as like a harmless chemical weapon
[01/13/2008 09:46:04 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Take THAT terrorists!
[01/13/2008 09:46:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but still distracting and then their eyes would get all watery and they would be able to shoot straight, then our guys could flank them
[01/13/2008 09:47:16 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Ahhh, you understand small squad tactics
[01/13/2008 09:47:35 PM] Bryan Goldberg: If only the geneva conventions didn't prohibit such weapons
[01/13/2008 09:48:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah fucking-a
[01/13/2008 09:49:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have to do everything to proper now, when other countries still use gorilla tactics against us
[01/13/2008 09:49:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's bullshit
[01/13/2008 09:49:31 PM] Bryan Goldberg: It's the price of being a superpower - we've got to show off by fighting with a hand behind our back
[01/13/2008 09:49:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: there should be a convention for using the same tactics as the enemy, that would be a true competition of greater force
[01/13/2008 09:50:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: once the respawner is invented, they should fight wars using a scoring system
[01/13/2008 09:50:30 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Oooo
[01/13/2008 09:50:32 PM] Bryan Goldberg: I like it
[01/13/2008 09:51:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: like battlefield style, you can only respawn at sectors owned by your team, and if they have all been over run, you team looses respawning abilities
[01/13/2008 09:51:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you can respawn the same person
[01/13/2008 09:52:04 PM] Bryan Goldberg: It'd sure save on body armor
[01/13/2008 09:52:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/13/2008 09:52:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it'd sure save on casualties
[01/13/2008 09:53:51 PM] Bryan Goldberg: But it'd make it easier on the suicide bombers if they could respawn
[01/13/2008 09:55:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i ordered another UPS for the consoles and projector
[01/13/2008 09:55:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's pretty sweet
[01/13/2008 09:56:28 PM] Bryan Goldberg: You guys are dangerously efficient
[01/13/2008 09:56:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey i have a legal question
[01/13/2008 09:57:10 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Hit me
[01/13/2008 09:59:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the school gave me a $110 dollars in parking tickets, but they didn't list the valid parking sticker ID number on the ticket, so i don't understand how they associated that car, with my name and account, isn't there any rules against invasion of privacy if they used the DMV to look up my license plate, and isn't there a rule against concealing information from me? and isn't it a law that tickets have to be given to you in person?
[01/13/2008 10:00:21 PM] Bryan Goldberg: nope
[01/13/2008 10:00:24 PM] Bryan Goldberg: They can do it
[01/13/2008 10:00:27 PM] Bryan Goldberg: you lose
[01/13/2008 10:00:37 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Sorry budday. :)
[01/13/2008 10:00:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit
[01/13/2008 10:01:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: what if they were violating their own terms and agreement?
[01/13/2008 10:02:09 PM] Bryan Goldberg: You could try to challenge it, but keep in mind this is all a simple fine, not a criminal offense. They only have to give very minor due process
[01/13/2008 10:02:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate parking services
[01/13/2008 10:04:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are such whores, i've heard so many stories of how people have gotten in accidents or relatives had died and they got some ticket for being on campus, and there was no way to get it removed
[01/13/2008 10:04:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: like keifer works for the school and he had to go on a last minute appointment which would have taken him like 20 minutes, and during that time he got a ticket for parking near the appointment
[01/13/2008 10:06:17 PM] Bryan Goldberg: They're evil. Best thing is to avoid them altogether
[01/13/2008 10:06:28 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Or have a friend on the inside - my second year strategy
[01/13/2008 10:06:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i'll just park next to bookmans like dave does from now on
[01/13/2008 10:07:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i paid like 200 dollars to be a mile closer to school because i don't want to walk miles back and forth every day during the rain and snow
[01/13/2008 10:07:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but bookmans it close enough

[01/13/2008 10:08:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already walk a lot while i'm on campus
[01/13/2008 10:09:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: want to go to vegas in the spring?
[01/13/2008 10:09:44 PM] Bryan Goldberg: Won't be able to. Army training starts in three weeks
[01/13/2008 10:10:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: shit well let me know when you have a break
[01/13/2008 10:10:44 PM] Bryan Goldberg: It could be a while. I don't finish training until July. You should talk to the guys - they may be interested
