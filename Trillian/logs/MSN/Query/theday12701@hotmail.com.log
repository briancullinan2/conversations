[15:16] b.cullinan@cox.net: like eaf or something like that
[15:16] b.cullinan@cox.net: you provide an encryption key, and the key can decrypt it

[05/18/2007 12:05:16 PM] Alex Markov: and we need all the documents to be online somewhere
[05/18/2007 12:05:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there should be a protocol for that
[05/18/2007 12:05:42 PM] Alex Markov: u had that good system u were tlaking about

[05/18/2007 12:07:33 PM] Alex Markov: looka t the sugar document manager
[05/18/2007 12:07:43 PM] Alex Markov: and see if its worth using that
[05/18/2007 12:07:45 PM] Alex Markov: or svn
[05/18/2007 12:07:46 PM] Alex Markov: or something else
[05/18/2007 12:08:04 PM] Alex Markov: because right now we have like 10 versions of contracts and we have no tempaltes but just modify old contracts for new clients :P
[05/18/2007 12:08:37 PM] Alex Markov: thats not effecient
[05/18/2007 12:09:02 PM] Alex Markov: right now alot of the company framework is setup. we just need to start reevaluating all our processes and flaws and make everything VERY effecient and systemized
[05/18/2007 12:09:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/18/2007 12:09:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't like the idea of using the document manager because with SVN we can store so much more
[05/18/2007 12:10:03 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/18/2007 12:10:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we can store entire projects
[05/18/2007 12:10:09 PM] Alex Markov: so test it out and finalize the solution
[05/18/2007 12:10:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its like having a daily backup, but the old backup isn't replaced
[05/18/2007 12:10:31 PM] Alex Markov: also we have to write protocols for alot of services.
[05/18/2007 12:10:36 PM] Alex Markov: we gotta split those up next week
[05/18/2007 12:10:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/18/2007 12:11:05 PM] Alex Markov: like for example... i was thinking you can write how a project maanger will order printing products for our clients
[05/18/2007 12:11:14 PM] Alex Markov: we have a dealer account with vistaprint.com
[05/18/2007 12:12:03 PM] Alex Markov: but like little issues like where to store the business card files. or who will actually upload it and purchase it. ect ect. like we need a good system. right now we all jsut order things all willy nilly
[05/18/2007 12:12:26 PM] Alex Markov: i am gonna be designign our accounting protocols so that everything is tracked and we have budgets and reports and all good stuff
[05/18/2007 12:12:40 PM] Alex Markov: and im gonna writeup how we will pitch, and actualyl execute our merchant account services
[05/18/2007 12:13:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see the nice thing about this SVN thing is we can use it to transfer files, we could even set up another net drive like the vault but for storing files
[05/18/2007 12:14:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either one would work, using SVN or netdrive
[05/18/2007 12:14:23 PM] Alex Markov: yes. i think that is very valuable. we need a place to hold all documents and so that when someone changes something everyone gets access to the change
[05/18/2007 12:14:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i think the SVN would handle source code for our websites better then just a network drive
[05/18/2007 12:15:47 PM] Alex Markov: i think a good document management and file management system is very important for RPS both for current operations and growth
[05/18/2007 12:15:47 PM] Alex Markov: brb
[05/18/2007 12:19:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i am installing the same type of svn on my own server now
[05/18/2007 12:25:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yay i love installing linux
[05/18/2007 12:26:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it was funny the other day i asked my friend what the best free anti-spyware software is (i had forgotten its spybot) and he responded linux

[05/21/2007 12:02:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is the context of the pitch
[05/21/2007 12:02:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you had told me a week ago when you brought it up that i needed an entire implementation of it, then i would have done so
[05/21/2007 12:02:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that would have taken more time
[05/21/2007 12:03:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so if my explanation of why we need it and when we need it is not a convincing enough arguement, then there is absolutely no reason why i should continue to explain myself
[05/21/2007 12:04:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not going to argue like this, you are the manager, you make requests, you requested that i find and example or create one, thats what i will do, but arguing about why we need a demo is completely pointless

[05/21/2007 12:36:15 PM] Alex Markov: u are right
[05/21/2007 12:37:05 PM] Alex Markov: regarding the demo however. u explained it. we both udnerstand that it is something we need. we however cannot definitvely say that it should be used for .doc files because we frankly dont know how it will handle them. that is why we need a demo to play with. maybe not even a demo but just the setup
[05/21/2007 12:37:56 PM] Alex Markov: so maybe it should be setup and we can play with it and run some tests
[05/21/2007 12:38:45 PM] Alex Markov: u convinced us. we are gonna use svn. we just need to figure out exactly for what. and the banner is somewhat important. that is our main image online. it is a forefront of the site and we eneded to be there to discuss it together.
[05/21/2007 12:39:40 PM] Alex Markov: about your part #2 about payments
[05/21/2007 12:39:58 PM] Alex Markov: i 100% agree. 
[05/21/2007 12:40:09 PM] Alex Markov: there should only be corrections. not changes
[05/21/2007 12:40:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do we have a contract that every client signs and returns to us?
[05/21/2007 12:40:36 PM] Alex Markov: when we get our quickbooks running the exact way we will implement all that and the BM is going to make sure clients pay on time
[05/21/2007 12:40:39 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/21/2007 12:40:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: may i see a copy?
[05/21/2007 12:41:04 PM] Alex Markov: but the contracts get amended due to the fact that projects go over schedule. often it is the client;'s fault
[05/21/2007 12:41:18 PM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "HS PC 1.3.doc"
[05/21/2007 12:41:38 PM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "NYB PC 1.3.doc"
[05/21/2007 12:42:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do we have document that explains everything to the client?
[05/21/2007 12:42:40 PM] Alex Markov: its all int he cotnract. but we need to add and expand on it. and have templates
[05/21/2007 12:42:40 PM] Alex Markov: for documents
[05/21/2007 12:42:54 PM] Alex Markov: that is where the document management system comes in
[05/21/2007 12:43:00 PM] Alex Markov: sugar also has ability to make documents templates
[05/21/2007 12:43:20 PM] Alex Markov: but we may be able to do it with the svn
[05/21/2007 12:43:26 PM] Alex Markov: we jsut ened a running svn to play around with and run some tests
[05/21/2007 12:44:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sugar should be used for creating templates
[05/21/2007 12:44:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the templates can be stored in the svn
[05/21/2007 12:44:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the svn should be used mostly for storage and sharing documents
[05/21/2007 12:44:43 PM] Alex Markov: we cant know 100% untill i see it and play with it. i definetly trust your expertise. but we all need to make a group decision
[05/21/2007 12:44:53 PM] Alex Markov: setup a live svn for our client html files
[05/21/2007 12:44:56 PM] Alex Markov: and we will paly with it
[05/21/2007 12:45:00 PM] Alex Markov: play
[05/21/2007 12:45:04 PM] Alex Markov: and run some tests
[05/21/2007 12:45:06 PM] Alex Markov: and senerios
[05/21/2007 12:48:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well i wish that robert felt the same way
[05/21/2007 12:48:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: he refuses to do as i request
[05/21/2007 12:48:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even with your approval
[05/21/2007 12:48:48 PM] Alex Markov: he does brian. u need to reread what he said. he said the exact same thing
[05/21/2007 12:48:56 PM] Alex Markov: what do u request?
[05/21/2007 12:49:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want him to create and account for svn
[05/21/2007 12:49:13 PM] Alex Markov: what account?
[05/21/2007 12:49:17 PM] Alex Markov: where
[05/21/2007 12:49:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: similar to a client website, on the server
[05/21/2007 12:49:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but this one will be for svn, we can put the svn website on it, and it will store all the svn files
[05/21/2007 12:50:51 PM] Alex Markov: bobby says that u guys ened to discuss implementation for it. which i agree. u need to plan out how its gonna be set up. 
[05/21/2007 12:51:06 PM] Alex Markov: if u already know briefly explain it
[05/21/2007 12:52:46 PM] Alex Markov: there are alot of issues that needs to be discussed and planned before setup is done. 
[05/21/2007 12:52:58 PM] Alex Markov: we should nto go setting up all willy nilly without a clear cut plan
[05/21/2007 12:53:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree
[05/21/2007 12:53:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i have tried to discuss this with him last time i worked on the svn
[05/21/2007 12:53:31 PM] Alex Markov: well now we have a new system
[05/21/2007 12:53:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this is something that should have been finished months ago
[05/21/2007 12:53:34 PM] Alex Markov: we need to set thing sup
[05/21/2007 12:53:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we already agreed that we should set one up last year
[05/21/2007 12:54:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and it never got done because robert did not want to follow through
[05/21/2007 12:54:26 PM] Alex Markov: ok. the past is the past
[05/21/2007 12:54:34 PM] Alex Markov: tomorow i am gonna outline the BM responsibilities
[05/21/2007 12:54:42 PM] Alex Markov: and wills tart delegating things like that so that things get done
[05/21/2007 01:10:46 PM] Alex Markov: yo
[05/21/2007 01:11:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hi

[05/21/2007 01:13:18 PM] Alex Markov: this is your project
[05/21/2007 01:13:27 PM] Alex Markov: u ened to schedule time with bobby when to discuss all the issues
[05/21/2007 01:13:36 PM] Alex Markov: to plan it out
[05/21/2007 01:13:42 PM] Alex Markov: as soon as possible
[05/21/2007 01:14:24 PM] Alex Markov: u ened to add robert as an attendee to the meeting you setup
[05/21/2007 01:18:29 PM] Alex Markov: if you ever cant get a hold of me on msn or just want to chat
[05/21/2007 01:18:36 PM] Alex Markov: PLEASE dont hesitate to call 914 620 5319
[05/21/2007 01:18:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2007 01:18:47 PM] Alex Markov: thats my treo
[05/21/2007 01:18:48 PM] Alex Markov: ok?
[05/21/2007 01:18:50 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[05/21/2007 01:19:00 PM] Alex Markov: we must have open lines of communication
[05/21/2007 01:19:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2007 01:19:12 PM] Alex Markov: even if u thinm sometimes we can discuss something better over the phone rather than msn
[05/21/2007 01:20:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you agree that the SVN should be a subsection of all document management?
[05/21/2007 01:21:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right not robert and i will work on getting the SVN on the server, and eventually the SVN Protocol, but i believe that it is just a part of the larger Document Protocol which will explain more then just submitting websites to the SVN
[05/21/2007 01:28:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: want your demo now?
[05/21/2007 01:31:13 PM] Alex Markov: lets set it up for our client websites first
[05/21/2007 01:31:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i set it up for my copy of them, it will be used the same way
[05/21/2007 01:31:48 PM] Alex Markov: what? i dont get it
[05/21/2007 01:32:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i run an svn server too, i have a client website on my computer that i am working on, so i store it in the svn
[05/21/2007 01:32:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will be used to same way on the rps server, just in a different location
[05/21/2007 01:33:20 PM] Alex Markov: send me the information i need to access it and play around with it
[05/21/2007 01:33:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well i have the web tool set up so far
[05/21/2007 01:33:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll send you a link to that and you can get an idea of what that part looks like
[05/21/2007 01:34:14 PM] Alex Markov: k
[05/21/2007 01:34:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sec i have to get it working from outside my network
[05/21/2007 01:40:37 PM] Alex Markov: k
[05/21/2007 01:40:43 PM] Alex Markov: brb gotta go make a quick hotdog downstairs

[05/21/2007 02:50:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/21/2007 02:52:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: (Link: http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/listing.php?repname=Documents&path=%2FCollege%2F#_College_)http://bjcsvn.mine.nu/listing.php?repname=Documents&path=%2FCollege%2F#_College_
[05/21/2007 02:53:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you click View Log next to Latency report thats where you can access all the versions
[05/21/2007 02:53:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it supports messages too
[05/21/2007 02:54:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and if you check both of them and click compare, thats the part we need to change
[05/21/2007 02:54:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we need to be able to compare them instantly online
[05/21/2007 02:54:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: which is overkill imo but robert mentioned it

[05/21/2007 04:13:39 PM] Alex Markov: well figure it out. it seems svn works rly fast. we should start using it ASAP
[05/21/2007 04:13:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok got it
[05/21/2007 04:14:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: svn://bjcsvn.mine.nu:62690/RPS/

[05/21/2007 04:17:34 PM] Alex Markov: it didnt prompt me for username beofre i created it. it should be locked to begin with
[05/21/2007 04:17:39 PM] Alex Markov: how do i upload a file
[05/21/2007 04:18:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm strange

[05/21/2007 04:21:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or create another directory that you have rps documents in now
[05/21/2007 04:21:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and checkout that directory on the server
[05/21/2007 04:21:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then commit the new files
[05/21/2007 04:21:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it should have asked for password
[05/21/2007 04:22:31 PM] Alex Markov: svn://bjcsvn.mine.nu:62690/RPS/NYB
[05/21/2007 04:22:49 PM] Alex Markov: ok tell me briefly what i should check out
[05/21/2007 04:23:18 PM] Alex Markov: like i want to open nyb pc 1.3
[05/21/2007 04:23:27 PM] Alex Markov: how do i make changes and apply them so it makes a new version
[05/21/2007 04:24:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: check them on your computer
[05/21/2007 04:24:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then click commit under tortoise svn
[05/21/2007 04:25:28 PM] Alex Markov: just so u know.... u need to give me more detailed instructions :P
[05/21/2007 04:25:37 PM] Alex Markov: im not as tech savy as u guys
[05/21/2007 04:26:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok so you made the NYB directory right?
[05/21/2007 04:26:34 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/21/2007 04:26:45 PM] Alex Markov: and i have a folder on my computer titled nyb
[05/21/2007 04:27:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right click on the folder on your computer and go to tortoise and click checkout
[05/21/2007 04:27:48 PM] Alex Markov: do i change any of those settings?
[05/21/2007 04:28:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 04:28:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: enter svn://bjcsvn.mine.nu:62690/RPS/NYB
[05/21/2007 04:28:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and click checkout
[05/21/2007 04:29:32 PM] Alex Markov: it says the target folder is not empty, are you sure u want to checkout/export intoi that folder
[05/21/2007 04:30:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/21/2007 04:30:49 PM] Alex Markov: ok i clicked yes
[05/21/2007 04:31:16 PM] Alex Markov: it says error failed to add file because onject ith same name exists
[05/21/2007 04:31:22 PM] Alex Markov: should i do this in a empty folder?
[05/21/2007 04:31:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm
[05/21/2007 04:32:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you already import a file into the svn?
[05/21/2007 04:32:26 PM] Alex Markov: yes i imported all those files into svn
[05/21/2007 04:32:39 PM] Alex Markov: i am clicking the folder they are in and pressing checkout
[05/21/2007 04:33:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see since they are already in the SVN they can't be replaced on your computer
[05/21/2007 04:33:46 PM] Alex Markov: ok so what do i do
[05/21/2007 04:34:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so delete them from the svn and check them out again
[05/21/2007 04:34:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: haven't quite figured it all out but it works pretty well
[05/21/2007 04:35:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you still have the files on your computer right?
[05/21/2007 04:35:57 PM] Alex Markov: ok i am doing it with a new and empty folder
[05/21/2007 04:35:59 PM] Alex Markov: i did a checkout
[05/21/2007 04:36:04 PM] Alex Markov: and the 4 files got transfered into it
[05/21/2007 04:36:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 04:36:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now delete the other copies and every time you change them use the check out ones
[05/21/2007 04:36:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then click commit to save the changes
[05/21/2007 04:36:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: under tortoise
[05/21/2007 04:37:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when you right click the folder that is
[05/21/2007 04:37:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it should have a little green checkmark
[05/21/2007 04:37:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or a red x if there are changes that haven't been saved
[05/21/2007 04:37:30 PM] Alex Markov: yes ok so i opened one of the files
[05/21/2007 04:37:34 PM] Alex Markov: and saved it as a new file with a new name
[05/21/2007 04:37:42 PM] Alex Markov: and press commit on the folder and it added it
[05/21/2007 04:37:56 PM] Alex Markov: how do i save a new version of the file without doing save as
[05/21/2007 04:38:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should just be able to save it normally
[05/21/2007 04:38:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like if you open it in word
[05/21/2007 04:38:21 PM] Alex Markov: but i dont wantto overwrite
[05/21/2007 04:38:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you mean?
[05/21/2007 04:38:42 PM] Alex Markov: like when we make a change to a PC 
[05/21/2007 04:38:47 PM] Alex Markov: (project contract)
[05/21/2007 04:39:03 PM] Alex Markov: we add a .1 to the file name
[05/21/2007 04:39:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well you don't have to anymore
[05/21/2007 04:39:25 PM] Alex Markov: so the final name was NYB PC 1.3
[05/21/2007 04:39:26 PM] Alex Markov: i made a change and saved that as nyb pc 1.4
[05/21/2007 04:39:26 PM] Alex Markov: can svn do that automatically? or will we still need to do that manuall. which is fine
[05/21/2007 04:39:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you only need 1 name
[05/21/2007 04:39:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats what svn does automatically
[05/21/2007 04:39:52 PM] Alex Markov: elaborate. tell me how do do that
[05/21/2007 04:39:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so make another change but save it, overwrite it, then click commit
[05/21/2007 04:40:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i'll show you more
[05/21/2007 04:40:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: here let me mess with the files a sec just to kind of start over
[05/21/2007 04:40:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok?
[05/21/2007 04:40:44 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[05/21/2007 04:40:59 PM] Alex Markov: do a few tests and see what kind of process we may start using
[05/21/2007 04:41:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i will tell you as i do it
[05/21/2007 04:41:13 PM] Alex Markov: k
[05/21/2007 04:41:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok so now i just downloaded your documents
[05/21/2007 04:41:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i checked them out
[05/21/2007 04:41:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so HS PC is the original version right?]
[05/21/2007 04:42:18 PM] Alex Markov: yeah the comany name changed half way to nyb
[05/21/2007 04:43:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok so say for example our new protocol says that we name it Contract Phase 1
[05/21/2007 04:43:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: .doc
[05/21/2007 04:44:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok still got the repo browser open?
[05/21/2007 04:44:09 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/21/2007 04:44:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: refresh the NYB folder
[05/21/2007 04:44:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right click and refresh
[05/21/2007 04:44:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: OR, right click the NYB folder on your computer and click Update
[05/21/2007 04:44:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you will see Contract Phase 1
[05/21/2007 04:45:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see it?
[05/21/2007 04:45:31 PM] Alex Markov: yes it poped up
[05/21/2007 04:45:32 PM] Alex Markov: thats rly cool
[05/21/2007 04:45:35 PM] Alex Markov: better than sugar
[05/21/2007 04:45:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok now i am going to update it
[05/21/2007 04:46:01 PM] Alex Markov: see its MUCH easier to show it with an example. this also goes for dealing with clients
[05/21/2007 04:46:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no i made all the changes for the second version
[05/21/2007 04:46:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i did it by copying and pasting, but in the future we will do it simply by changing the document
[05/21/2007 04:47:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now click update again
[05/21/2007 04:47:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and open the contract phase 1.doc
[05/21/2007 04:47:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i'll do one more example then you can try it
[05/21/2007 04:48:05 PM] Alex Markov: i see u changed it
[05/21/2007 04:48:06 PM] Alex Markov: i see
[05/21/2007 04:48:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and eventually we will have all the methods for making changes written out
[05/21/2007 04:48:18 PM] Alex Markov: now how do we go back to the original document?
[05/21/2007 04:48:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok you see the change?
[05/21/2007 04:48:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good question
[05/21/2007 04:48:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am glad you asked
[05/21/2007 04:49:02 PM] Alex Markov: yes we ened it allw ritten out because when we bring in new project managers to work with the system.... they gotta have good documentation so they dont ask us for as much help
[05/21/2007 04:49:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so here is how we see the old one
[05/21/2007 04:49:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either (Link: http://192.168.1.103/websvn/log.php?repname=RPS&path=%2FNYB%2F&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1)http://192.168.1.103/websvn/log.php?repname=RPS&path=%2FNYB%2F&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1
[05/21/2007 04:49:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: through the website
[05/21/2007 04:49:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you click on any of those and see each change that was made
[05/21/2007 04:55:25 PM] Alex Markov: file not found
[05/21/2007 04:55:30 PM] Alex Markov: can we put this whole thing behind an SSL?
[05/21/2007 04:55:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/21/2007 04:55:46 PM] Alex Markov: not file not found
[05/21/2007 04:55:51 PM] Alex Markov: The server at 192.168.1.103 is taking too long to respond.
[05/21/2007 04:55:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it won't be found in revisions before 3
[05/21/2007 04:56:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because we started it at 4, and updated it in 5
[05/21/2007 04:56:13 PM] Alex Markov: i dont get it
[05/21/2007 04:56:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so thats why there is a file not found in 3
[05/21/2007 04:56:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its based on the directory
[05/21/2007 04:56:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: whenever we commit a change it updates the revision
[05/21/2007 04:57:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and we made 3 changes before we added the file Contract Phase 1
[05/21/2007 04:57:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so when we added that to the SVN it was added at revision 4
[05/21/2007 04:57:44 PM] Alex Markov: ok lets start over with fake documents
[05/21/2007 04:57:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so if you right click on the folder and go to update to revision... you can pick 3 4 and 5 to test it
[05/21/2007 04:58:21 PM] Alex Markov: i want to see it work exactly howit would if we were to use it
[05/21/2007 04:58:31 PM] Alex Markov: can u setup a fake folder
[05/21/2007 04:58:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2007 04:58:40 PM] Alex Markov: or a test folder rather
[05/21/2007 04:58:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sure
[05/21/2007 04:58:45 PM] Alex Markov: like a fake client folde
[05/21/2007 04:58:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why don't you do it
[05/21/2007 04:58:56 PM] Alex Markov: k sec
[05/21/2007 04:59:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: set one up for iWD
[05/21/2007 04:59:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you make the folder on your computer
[05/21/2007 04:59:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then make it in the SVN and check it out
[05/21/2007 04:59:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can do it all from the same window if you go to checkout and click the ... button
[05/21/2007 04:59:44 PM] Alex Markov: its iWR instead of iWD now
[05/21/2007 04:59:49 PM] Alex Markov: R for redesign 
[05/21/2007 04:59:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2007 05:00:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok now i checked it out too
[05/21/2007 05:00:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so lets create a contract
[05/21/2007 05:00:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just a sample
[05/21/2007 05:00:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and name it Contract.doc
[05/21/2007 05:01:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then you can right click inside the folder window also and go to tortoise and commit...
[05/21/2007 05:01:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and check your new file (Contract.doc) and commit it
[05/21/2007 05:04:21 PM] Alex Markov: ok i think i did it
[05/21/2007 05:04:28 PM] Alex Markov: i saved it
[05/21/2007 05:04:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: great
[05/21/2007 05:04:35 PM] Alex Markov: now how do i look at the old version
[05/21/2007 05:04:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now all i have to do is click update and i have your new stuff
[05/21/2007 05:05:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you just made it right?
[05/21/2007 05:05:04 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/21/2007 05:05:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now change it
[05/21/2007 05:05:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and save it
[05/21/2007 05:05:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and commit it
[05/21/2007 05:05:29 PM] Alex Markov: right now the file has a #2 in it
[05/21/2007 05:05:32 PM] Alex Markov: i started it with a #1
[05/21/2007 05:05:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2007 05:05:54 PM] Alex Markov: done
[05/21/2007 05:05:55 PM] Alex Markov: now its at a 3
[05/21/2007 05:05:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you commit it when you made it number 1
[05/21/2007 05:06:02 PM] Alex Markov: maybe
[05/21/2007 05:06:08 PM] Alex Markov: regardless its now #3
[05/21/2007 05:06:10 PM] Alex Markov: i definetly commited #2
[05/21/2007 05:06:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you probably didn't check it, because it was new it doesn't automatically put a check box
[05/21/2007 05:06:41 PM] Alex Markov: thats fine i commited from 2 to 3
[05/21/2007 05:06:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so mine says 2 still, so i am going to update because i know you made a change
[05/21/2007 05:07:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now mine says 3
[05/21/2007 05:07:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: also i think you have to close out of word to use update
[05/21/2007 05:07:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because word locks the file
[05/21/2007 05:07:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now i am going to work on that file
[05/21/2007 05:07:41 PM] Alex Markov: save as 4
[05/21/2007 05:07:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i will save my changes to it
[05/21/2007 05:07:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and now you close word and click update
[05/21/2007 05:08:07 PM] Alex Markov: not commit?
[05/21/2007 05:08:10 PM] Alex Markov: commit is only for new files?
[05/21/2007 05:08:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: commit is for saving changes
[05/21/2007 05:08:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: update it for retrieving new changes that other people made
[05/21/2007 05:08:40 PM] Alex Markov: k
[05/21/2007 05:08:54 PM] Alex Markov: nice it says 4
[05/21/2007 05:09:03 PM] Alex Markov: ok now how do we see versions 2 and 3
[05/21/2007 05:09:41 PM] Alex Markov: can this program tag a header of the doc file anywhere
[05/21/2007 05:10:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you mean tag a header?
[05/21/2007 05:10:33 PM] Alex Markov: like with the version or revision #
[05/21/2007 05:11:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmm if you right click and go to show log
[05/21/2007 05:11:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: under tortoise
[05/21/2007 05:11:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will tell you what revision we are working with
[05/21/2007 05:11:43 PM] Alex Markov: 8 9 and 10
[05/21/2007 05:11:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: shows all the actions too
[05/21/2007 05:12:03 PM] Alex Markov: oh how shit
[05/21/2007 05:12:06 PM] Alex Markov: i can just see it
[05/21/2007 05:12:12 PM] Alex Markov: i can click open and it opens up
[05/21/2007 05:12:17 PM] Alex Markov: how=hot
[05/21/2007 05:12:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: under log?
[05/21/2007 05:12:38 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/21/2007 05:12:46 PM] Alex Markov: i can clikc thefirst revision. the original one
[05/21/2007 05:12:54 PM] Alex Markov: and right click open
[05/21/2007 05:12:57 PM] Alex Markov: and it shows the file with the 2
[05/21/2007 05:13:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nice
[05/21/2007 05:13:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i didn't even realize that
[05/21/2007 05:13:40 PM] Alex Markov: thats perfect
[05/21/2007 05:14:04 PM] Alex Markov: ok so we gonna briefly go over it in the morning with bobby. and then u gotta design our svn folders
[05/21/2007 05:14:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: click show differences
[05/21/2007 05:14:12 PM] Alex Markov: like maybe we should have a folder per client
[05/21/2007 05:14:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats hot
[05/21/2007 05:14:32 PM] Alex Markov: Index: C:/Documents and Settings/Alex/Desktop/iWR/Client- Test contract.doc 
=================================================================== 
Cannot display: file marked as a binary type. 
svn:mime-type = application/octet-stream 

[05/21/2007 05:14:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not in the website
[05/21/2007 05:14:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: using tortoise
[05/21/2007 05:14:54 PM] Alex Markov: i think we should all sit down and come up with the list of folders
[05/21/2007 05:15:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2007 05:15:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: use tortoise
[05/21/2007 05:15:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: click show log
[05/21/2007 05:15:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats what you were using to open it right?
[05/21/2007 05:15:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[05/21/2007 05:15:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: click show differences also
[05/21/2007 05:15:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: in the show log view
[05/21/2007 05:17:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cool huh?
[05/21/2007 05:17:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can even revert changes
[05/21/2007 05:17:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if someone fucks stuff up
[05/21/2007 05:19:18 PM] Alex Markov: aweomse
[05/21/2007 05:19:20 PM] Alex Markov: u da man
[05/21/2007 05:19:31 PM] Alex Markov: u da man with tha plan
[05/21/2007 05:19:33 PM] Alex Markov: good shit brian
[05/21/2007 05:19:35 PM] Alex Markov: this is perfect
[05/21/2007 05:21:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see i kept trying to tell robert that
[05/21/2007 05:22:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and things will move a lot quicker 
[05/21/2007 05:22:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when we get the protocol writen
[05/21/2007 05:23:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm going to play around with some configurations on the file system
[05/21/2007 05:23:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just lay out a folder structure for you
[05/21/2007 05:26:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now understand that eventually there will be 1000 changes per day
[05/21/2007 05:27:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but using this log should make it easier to keep track of, if we need to refer to previous versions we can just look at the dates and use the Show Differences Option
[05/21/2007 05:32:48 PM] Alex Markov: kk
[05/21/2007 05:33:02 PM] Alex Markov: see if it can add a revision number to like the bottom of the document automatically
[05/21/2007 05:33:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hmmm
[05/21/2007 05:33:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not too sure we want to do that
[05/21/2007 05:33:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what about documents that go to clients
[05/21/2007 05:33:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do we really want to have to remove the revision number
[05/21/2007 05:34:11 PM] Alex Markov: well i want clients to see their contract version number
[05/21/2007 05:34:19 PM] Alex Markov: because the contracts all look so similar
[05/21/2007 05:34:30 PM] Alex Markov: sometiems there are 2 or 3 contracts
[05/21/2007 05:34:42 PM] Alex Markov: that they have. all our contracts have a version # that the clients see
[05/21/2007 05:36:04 PM] Alex Markov: thats not important tho
[05/21/2007 05:36:11 PM] Alex Markov: its not a big deal if clients dont see version numbers
[05/21/2007 05:37:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we might just have to write those in ourselves before we save it
[05/21/2007 05:48:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: svn://share@192.168.1.103/RPS
[05/21/2007 05:48:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was thinking a structure like that

[05/22/2007 07:52:54 PM] Alex Markov: hey
[05/22/2007 07:53:04 PM] Alex Markov: so the problem with svn right now is we cant restrict people from seeing the folders?
[05/22/2007 09:20:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the problem with the svn is robert
[05/22/2007 09:20:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i should not be required to run my own server for testing out configurations for the company
[05/22/2007 09:21:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: he is a control freak, and refuses to install the things we need, all he wants to do is argue with me about it and i am getting tired of it
[05/22/2007 09:24:39 PM] Alex Markov: the issue is not just brian. the company is liable for losses that our cients incur. we run alot fo things through the server. only me and robert have full access to it right now
[05/22/2007 09:25:22 PM] Alex Markov: errr
[05/22/2007 09:25:25 PM] Alex Markov: the issue is not jsut robert i meant
[05/22/2007 09:25:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not asking for root access
[05/22/2007 09:25:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am asking for an account, and i all i have gotten is zero cooperation
[05/22/2007 09:26:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am at the point where it is not worth it for me to try and prove myself worthy for setting this up
[05/22/2007 09:26:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i made the proposal and you guys run everything, so you decide
[05/22/2007 09:26:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can wait
[05/22/2007 09:26:33 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really can
[05/22/2007 09:26:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you've said to me 2 or 3 times now that we should be used subversion
[05/22/2007 09:27:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert still doesn't fully appreciate the idea, despite how much i've tried to explain how valuable it is
[05/22/2007 09:28:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so, i'll just wait, until you guys are ready to fully commit to it, but when something goes wrong in a website and we need those backups, thats really going to hurt us, or when we have documents that are spread out all over 10 different peoples computers and no one knows what the latest version is, we will really get hurt then too
[05/22/2007 09:29:14 PM] Alex Markov: well until we figure out how to secure it we cant use it
[05/22/2007 09:29:29 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert keeps bring up things that it SHOULD do before he even want to give me something to test it on, and unfortunately i need an area to test it on in order to figure out if it can do the things we need
[05/22/2007 09:29:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so there is some more circular reasoning for you
[05/22/2007 09:30:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just goes back and forth, i need a place to test our ideas, and i need to prove our ideas will work in order to get a place to test them
[05/22/2007 09:30:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: circular reasoning
[05/22/2007 09:30:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i'll just wait
[05/22/2007 09:40:53 PM] Alex Markov: but what is the problem of testing it on your server if u already have it isntalled?
[05/22/2007 09:41:06 PM] Alex Markov: when we first started with RPS we did all work on our personal computers
[05/22/2007 09:41:15 PM] Alex Markov: overtime rps bought us computers
[05/22/2007 09:41:24 PM] Alex Markov: just like RPS will soon buy u a badass desktop
[05/22/2007 09:42:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because my server isn't set up the same way
[05/22/2007 09:42:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it would take weeks to learn what you have professionals for
[05/22/2007 09:43:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i may have it installed and use it myself, but i could always run into problems when configuring it the same way on the rps server
[05/22/2007 09:43:50 PM] Alex Markov: is it similar? my concern is i dont want us fucking around with our main client server if we dont have too. 
[05/22/2007 09:44:12 PM] Alex Markov: can u work out the bugs on your server and then we can work on setting it up on rps server?
[05/22/2007 09:44:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: each account is pretty isolated from the other ones
[05/22/2007 09:44:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the bugs i have only run into on the rps server last time i tried
[05/22/2007 09:45:23 PM] Alex Markov: from what i understand there is alot to be done on our server for it to be rdy. i would feel much mroe comfortable that we see a working system on your server and then we try to imitate it on rps server
[05/22/2007 09:45:33 PM] Alex Markov: can u do me a favor and try that first? :P
[05/22/2007 09:57:43 PM] Alex Markov: please brian
[05/22/2007 09:58:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok

[05/28/2007 12:43:31 AM] Alex Markov: our tuesday meeting will feed into the wednesday meeting
[05/28/2007 12:43:59 AM] Alex Markov: also i think im gonna delegate another major part of our company to you since u had already done such agood job on it
[05/28/2007 12:44:01 AM] Alex Markov: specialists
[05/28/2007 12:44:10 AM] Alex Markov: we ened a standard way for specialists to deal with PMs
[05/28/2007 12:44:26 AM] Alex Markov: like there needs to be standard writeups for PSD jobs and PHP jobs and every other tyype of jobs
[05/28/2007 12:44:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree
[05/28/2007 12:44:45 AM] Alex Markov: thats all one big can of worms. contracts. writeups
[05/28/2007 12:44:46 AM] Alex Markov: ect
[05/28/2007 12:44:58 AM] Alex Markov: everntually we need lawyer to look at contracts we have with our specialist
[05/28/2007 12:44:59 AM] Alex Markov: s
[05/28/2007 12:45:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but more importantly, there is already problems with communication between robert and i, i have a few ways that we can fix this that would really be beneficial to our relationships
[05/28/2007 12:46:50 AM] Alex Markov: regarding phone pickups... often we have other responsibilities which will take precedent over work. that is perfectly ok. however we must try to keep lines of communication open as much as psosible. for example... if someone calls multiple times. no matter what time it is or what we are doing. we should make an effort to pick up. for exampl.e if it is like 5am and u have an emergency 
[05/28/2007 12:47:01 AM] Alex Markov: and u call my phone like 5 times in a row. i should pick up
[05/28/2007 12:47:04 AM] Alex Markov: if not keep calling
[05/28/2007 12:47:25 AM] Alex Markov: if u are busy. a quick txt message after a missed call is always great
[05/28/2007 12:47:31 AM] Alex Markov: like "with the fam. will call u back"
[05/28/2007 12:47:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree and i will make that effort
[05/28/2007 12:47:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but we can talk more in depth tomorrow
[05/28/2007 12:47:57 AM] Alex Markov: the txt messages will be eaiser when u get ur treo
[05/28/2007 12:48:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you should get to bed
[05/28/2007 12:48:44 AM] Alex Markov: regarding "attitude problem" dont worry. bobby is also rly high strung. he doesnt mean it and i am sure u dont mean it. we all must keep reminding ourselves to stay calm and relaxed. no matter what issues arise
[05/28/2007 12:48:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am talking to robert about the svn, i think i might have a senario that works, can we plan a brief meeting to present this senario sometime before the end of the week?
[05/28/2007 12:48:59 AM] Alex Markov: take everything with a little humor and we will be ok
[05/28/2007 12:49:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i suppose thats a wise idea
[05/28/2007 12:49:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so when are you available for like and hour tomorrow?
[05/28/2007 12:49:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am free until 5 or so
[05/28/2007 12:50:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have a bit to look over with jambonie, and thats it, tuesday i will be back in business, i really needed these last few days to myself, but as you can see i am ready to get back up to flagstaff and work
[05/28/2007 12:50:35 AM] Alex Markov: tomorow is quite busy. i gotta be up at 9am to go throgh paper work and prepare all checks for bills to go out tuesday morning. then me and bobby have a meeting regarding soem xcart stuff at 8am his time
[05/28/2007 12:50:45 AM] Alex Markov: and then i gotta go to the city for the afternoon for memorial day stuff
[05/28/2007 12:51:08 AM] Alex Markov: dont worry. its memorial day weekend. its a time to relax

[05/29/2007 09:06:18 AM] Alex Markov: well look at the topics we have to discuss
[05/29/2007 09:07:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh contract one is tomorro
[05/29/2007 09:07:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: w
[05/29/2007 09:07:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thats fine
[05/29/2007 09:08:10 AM] Alex Markov: yeah
[05/29/2007 09:08:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks like its you guys that need to be prepared
[05/29/2007 09:08:56 AM] Alex Markov: well today's meeting is not super long. we have to briefly touch on all those topics
[05/29/2007 09:09:11 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i sure hope it is breifly
[05/29/2007 09:09:52 AM] Alex Markov: ok go back to bed. if u have any jambonie or ffz work to do try to wake up soon to get it out of the way
[05/29/2007 09:09:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need to properly label the team for these meeting
[05/29/2007 09:10:21 AM] Alex Markov: opm staff isnt proper team?
[05/29/2007 09:10:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just says pm1
[05/29/2007 09:10:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for meeting 3 it is
[05/29/2007 09:11:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but contract and svn stuff is higher up corporate stuff
[05/29/2007 09:11:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: contract stuff would be hpm
[05/29/2007 09:11:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or higher
[05/29/2007 09:11:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: svn would be higher too
[05/29/2007 09:12:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean if we think of it on the level of implementing it into the entire company, who has the power to do that?
[05/29/2007 09:12:53 AM] Alex Markov: not sure yet
[05/29/2007 09:12:59 AM] Alex Markov: PM1 is project management team 1
[05/29/2007 09:13:01 AM] Alex Markov: i lead that
[05/29/2007 09:13:06 AM] Alex Markov: bobby controls PM2
[05/29/2007 09:13:31 AM] Alex Markov: basically... eventually i will step away from doing projects. so PM1 will be given to someone else
[05/29/2007 09:13:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes but we all play multiple roles
[05/29/2007 09:14:13 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: eventually i will be pm1 or pm3 or whatever, but i also do tons of coding, like a specialist, so does robert
[05/29/2007 09:15:05 AM] Alex Markov: u will run PM3
[05/29/2007 09:15:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but these are corporate changes and discussions, so we need to take on these discussions with the ideas that we will eventually be in these higher positions, we need to view them from the higher perspective 
[05/29/2007 09:15:23 AM] Alex Markov: u get paid as a contract employee for the coding u do
[05/29/2007 09:15:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, but you understand what i am saying?
[05/29/2007 09:16:02 AM] Alex Markov: yes but for the time being there are too many management tems
[05/29/2007 09:16:11 AM] Alex Markov: most things should and will be handlded in the OPM team
[05/29/2007 09:16:25 AM] Alex Markov: maybe opm management
[05/29/2007 09:16:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we need to view these meetings and discuss them as if we already have people working under us, and it is the best thing to do for the company
[05/29/2007 09:16:41 AM] Alex Markov: agreed
[05/29/2007 09:16:49 AM] Alex Markov: well one of the things we have to discuss today is sugar workflows
[05/29/2007 09:17:08 AM] Alex Markov: either u or bobby need to look into workflows to see what it is. 
[05/29/2007 09:17:25 AM] Alex Markov: and we eventually need to figure out where to hold these meetings
[05/29/2007 09:17:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like from our final positions in the company, not where we are now, because eventually there will be tons of employees, and i come to you wanted to know about contracts as you are a BM not PM1
[05/29/2007 09:17:49 AM] Alex Markov: true. 
[05/29/2007 09:18:01 AM] Alex Markov: i think all company discussion meetings should be in OPM management team
[05/29/2007 09:18:06 AM] Alex Markov: thats operations management department
[05/29/2007 09:18:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok makes sense
[05/29/2007 09:18:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but is there a opm team?
[05/29/2007 09:19:03 AM] Alex Markov: yeah we have like 20 team lol
[05/29/2007 09:19:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because they are all showing up as labeled pm1
[05/29/2007 09:19:12 AM] Alex Markov: i know that is my default label
[05/29/2007 09:20:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anywho, thats another thing i want to address tomorrow during our meeting is operation of meetings and allocation of authority and how we need to be playing multiple roles
[05/29/2007 09:20:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll go ahead and modify the meeting description
[05/29/2007 09:20:54 AM] Alex Markov: kk
[05/29/2007 09:21:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and like i said i will have some ideas well written out to present so thing should move fairly quickly
[05/29/2007 09:22:09 AM] Alex Markov: awesome
[05/29/2007 09:22:23 AM] Alex Markov: do u have any work left for jambonie or ffz?
[05/29/2007 09:22:41 AM] Alex Markov: so bobby has nothing to say during today's meetings because we need to touch on those projects
[05/29/2007 09:23:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah there is 1 thing left that i know of, and that is learning to use paypal
[05/29/2007 09:23:45 AM] Alex Markov: cool
[05/29/2007 09:24:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: need to do that this week when he won't be around to bitch at me
[05/29/2007 09:24:13 AM] Alex Markov: hehe
[05/29/2007 09:24:48 AM] Alex Markov: do u want to create a protocl on how to make protocols?

[05/29/2007 09:27:12 AM] Alex Markov: i am idea guy and talker. 
[05/29/2007 09:27:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i see a lot of points made on the opportunities protocol but it could be improved on its format

[05/29/2007 02:16:41 PM] Alex Markov: i think 1,000,000
[05/29/2007 02:16:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good stuff
[05/29/2007 02:16:53 PM] Alex Markov: basically in like a year or two u will own like 20% of firm
[05/29/2007 02:16:59 PM] Alex Markov: and then we will sit down and renegotiate
[05/29/2007 02:17:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to learn how to use shares, i've never taken part in the stock market before
[05/29/2007 02:17:05 PM] Alex Markov: probably bump u up even more
[05/29/2007 02:17:13 PM] Alex Markov: well this isnt stock market yet
[05/29/2007 02:17:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or pay me salery
[05/29/2007 02:17:32 PM] Alex Markov: basically... if the company was to ever go public. or we get bought out. you will get a certain price for each share
[05/29/2007 02:17:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know, but if we go public someday i need to learn what my shares can do for me
[05/29/2007 02:17:48 PM] Alex Markov: oh dont worry. you will be taken care of
[05/29/2007 02:18:06 PM] Alex Markov: if you go on the current pace you have been going... we will all be taken care of
[05/29/2007 02:18:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so anyways, want to go over some of these topics?
[05/29/2007 02:18:59 PM] Alex Markov: this summer you gonan do more projects. you'll get paid for that. and then when we have extra money lying around we'll give you some for the  
RPS development work
[05/29/2007 02:18:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how is NYB coming?  i worked on the template i am not sure that ever got finished
[05/29/2007 02:19:17 PM] Alex Markov: but neither me or bobby get paid for that. basically we are buidling a framework so we can do client projects in a very effecient invornment
[05/29/2007 02:19:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i understand
[05/29/2007 02:19:26 PM] Alex Markov: yes ok. so lets get to the meeting
[05/29/2007 02:19:32 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?module=Meetings&action=DetailView&record=b612a1e3-cbec-5238-9ad7-4659edc0797f)https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/index.php?module=Meetings&action=DetailView&record=b612a1e3-cbec-5238-9ad7-4659edc0797f
[05/29/2007 02:19:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: already there sweet cheeks
[05/29/2007 02:19:44 PM] Alex Markov: bobby mailed u $750 check
[05/29/2007 02:19:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/29/2007 02:19:58 PM] Alex Markov: u will get another $750 next week
[05/29/2007 02:20:08 PM] Alex Markov: now we gotta figure out about nyb
[05/29/2007 02:20:16 PM] Alex Markov: do u have free incoming minutes on your cell?
[05/29/2007 02:20:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sounds fine, i can wait, i know this is a new company and we have expenses
[05/29/2007 02:20:39 PM] Alex Markov: i appreciatte it. i promise u wont be disappointed once everything is set up
[05/29/2007 02:20:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have plenty of minutes, i can talk for an hour if you rather do that
[05/29/2007 02:20:48 PM] Alex Markov: well well do both msn and phone
[05/29/2007 02:20:50 PM] Alex Markov: want me to call u?
[05/29/2007 02:20:52 PM] Alex Markov: or u call me
[05/29/2007 02:20:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't talk inside
[05/29/2007 02:21:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have to go 10 feet away from the building to get reception
[05/29/2007 02:21:09 PM] Alex Markov: why, no service?
[05/29/2007 02:21:11 PM] Alex Markov: jesus
[05/29/2007 02:21:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will just keep dropping our call
[05/29/2007 02:21:24 PM] Alex Markov: u think verizon will be better?
[05/29/2007 02:21:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when i talked to quest, the poor indian had to call me back like 6 times, and i tried going all over the room
[05/29/2007 02:22:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i hope verizon is better, everyone says it is great up here, i know tons of people with it and they say they always have full service
[05/29/2007 02:22:08 PM] Alex Markov: i really hope it will be
[05/29/2007 02:22:13 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[05/29/2007 02:22:20 PM] Alex Markov: because treos are roughly $150 a month :-/
[05/29/2007 02:22:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/29/2007 02:22:29 PM] Alex Markov: so it would be a shame if u cant use it when u get it
[05/29/2007 02:22:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anywho, talking online will go quicker without robert here
[05/29/2007 02:22:44 PM] Alex Markov: ok go outside
[05/29/2007 02:22:53 PM] Alex Markov: i need to explain what we need for nyb
[05/29/2007 02:22:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i address the issue with our meetings in my notes for tomorrow
[05/29/2007 02:22:58 PM] Alex Markov: it will be wquicker to discuss over the phone
[05/29/2007 02:23:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/29/2007 02:23:07 PM] Alex Markov: call me when u are rdy
[05/29/2007 02:50:10 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=103&page=3)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=103&page=3
[05/29/2007 02:50:34 PM] Alex Markov: scroll to the bottom
[05/29/2007 02:50:44 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=29&d=1180345943)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=29&d=1180345943
[05/29/2007 02:50:51 PM] Alex Markov: that is the recent concept
[05/29/2007 02:51:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that looks really great
[05/29/2007 02:51:05 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=32&d=1180359819)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=32&d=1180359819
[05/29/2007 02:51:13 PM] Alex Markov: i proposed that the backgorund of the boxes is that dark grey
[05/29/2007 02:51:15 PM] Alex Markov: check that out
[05/29/2007 02:51:18 PM] Alex Markov: i think that looks HOT
[05/29/2007 02:51:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i definitely think the more grey makes it looks more even colors
[05/29/2007 02:52:03 PM] Alex Markov: the main navigation bullets are rly sweet too. i think those should be the standard RPS bulletds
[05/29/2007 02:52:07 PM] Alex Markov: for documents and such'
[05/29/2007 02:52:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah those are really great
[05/29/2007 02:53:12 PM] Alex Markov: any suggestion you have?
[05/29/2007 02:53:21 PM] Alex Markov: i think we are very close 
[05/29/2007 02:53:27 PM] Alex Markov: this site is gonna be rly sweet
[05/29/2007 02:53:34 PM] Alex Markov: its gonna be our company image
[05/29/2007 02:53:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so the only suggestion i have and i can put this in the forum too is the grey headings with the grey background gets a little washed out, i really think this would be fixed if the just vertically flip the fade on those heading backgrounds
[05/29/2007 02:53:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see how it goes from dark to light grey
[05/29/2007 02:54:07 PM] Alex Markov: i think we sjould have those grey headers at all
[05/29/2007 02:54:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just try a vertical flip on those headings
[05/29/2007 02:54:15 PM] Alex Markov: i think they should be jsut part of the background
[05/29/2007 02:54:26 PM] Alex Markov: so the top of the boxes are jsut those like tabs
[05/29/2007 02:54:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way is fine with me, i think it looks great
[05/29/2007 02:54:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think just tabs might be a little too plain, the rest of the page is very active
[05/29/2007 02:55:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anywho, looks great i can't wait for the html version
[05/29/2007 02:55:28 PM] Alex Markov: yeah. my concern is that the site needs to be as plain as possible without looking ugly. because alot of our clients are morons. and alot of them are old
[05/29/2007 02:55:38 PM] Alex Markov: the site cant be too busy. or they wil get intimidated
[05/29/2007 02:56:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah. good point, i don't think its too clustered, its active, but well laid out
[05/29/2007 02:56:08 PM] Alex Markov: but regardless.... i wanted to run this by you to get ur input
[05/29/2007 02:56:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks good
[05/29/2007 02:56:18 PM] Alex Markov: :)
[05/29/2007 02:56:24 PM] Alex Markov: its gonna be something we will be rly proud of
[05/29/2007 02:56:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah definitely
[05/29/2007 02:56:34 PM] Alex Markov: like u can be like "check out my company website"
[05/29/2007 02:56:41 PM] Alex Markov: and know that people are gonna belike "wow
[05/29/2007 02:56:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, it will be hot
[05/29/2007 02:56:52 PM] Alex Markov: nice
[05/29/2007 02:56:53 PM] Alex Markov: moving on
[05/29/2007 02:56:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: protocols
[05/29/2007 02:57:08 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=84)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=84
[05/29/2007 02:57:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we are going to talk about DM and SVN protocol a little more tomorrow?
[05/29/2007 02:57:28 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/29/2007 02:57:50 PM] Alex Markov: all our protocols are gonna be in the forums tho. the idea for the comapny is to have somewhat of an opensource philosophy to the protocols
[05/29/2007 02:57:59 PM] Alex Markov: so once all protocols are documented.... 
[05/29/2007 02:58:03 PM] Alex Markov: in posts in the forum...
[05/29/2007 02:58:18 PM] Alex Markov: each protocol will be open for discussion
[05/29/2007 02:58:32 PM] Alex Markov: but we'll take it one day at a time
[05/29/2007 02:58:44 PM] Alex Markov: currently... the leads and opportunity protcols are done
[05/29/2007 02:58:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree, then the original writeup can be modified based on suggestions in the forum
[05/29/2007 02:58:52 PM] Alex Markov: but they are jsut roughd rafts and may be too complex for their own god
[05/29/2007 02:58:56 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[05/29/2007 02:58:59 PM] Alex Markov: good
[05/29/2007 02:59:26 PM] Alex Markov: also i believe that alot of the protocols can be automated in sugar using their workflows engine
[05/29/2007 02:59:52 PM] Alex Markov: in sugar if u go to admin>studio>workflowmanager
[05/29/2007 03:00:06 PM] Alex Markov: you can create workflows. 
[05/29/2007 03:00:28 PM] Alex Markov: now i dont know exactly what this is. i believe u or bobby are beter to udnerstand this. 
[05/29/2007 03:00:34 PM] Alex Markov: because u guys do programming
[05/29/2007 03:00:40 PM] Alex Markov: and workflows are similar to programming
[05/29/2007 03:01:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah looks cool i will have to play around with it later
[05/29/2007 03:01:18 PM] Alex Markov: the protocols need to be as simple as humanly possible
[05/29/2007 03:01:35 PM] Alex Markov: because when we bring in new PMs.... they ened to be able to pick shit up right away
[05/29/2007 03:01:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think they should be simple, but very well described
[05/29/2007 03:01:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they need to be precise really
[05/29/2007 03:01:57 PM] Alex Markov: yeah
[05/29/2007 03:02:18 PM] Alex Markov: i honestly believe we should figure out the workflows shit... before we start really writing the protocols
[05/29/2007 03:02:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so those protocols look good, i will use that for a template when describing how to write protocols
[05/29/2007 03:02:31 PM] Alex Markov: because it would be a bitch to add workflows into all protocvols after they are done
[05/29/2007 03:02:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i will look into it soon
[05/29/2007 03:03:05 PM] Alex Markov: ok out it on your list. with bobby gone this summe.r u gonna become our main sugar manager
[05/29/2007 03:03:23 PM] Alex Markov: also u know alot more about php than he does
[05/29/2007 03:03:31 PM] Alex Markov: u figured that specialist shit out so well
[05/29/2007 03:03:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ha well thank you, glad you approve
[05/29/2007 03:04:36 PM] Alex Markov: do u want to play around with it right now together?
[05/29/2007 03:04:57 PM] Alex Markov: because we need to start using our protocols to start ironining out the ineffecincies
[05/29/2007 03:05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cool
[05/29/2007 03:05:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i made one
[05/29/2007 03:06:08 PM] Alex Markov: explain it so i have an oidea of how it works
[05/29/2007 03:06:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow this looks really scalable
[05/29/2007 03:06:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and exactly how i expected
[05/29/2007 03:07:05 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=38)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=38
[05/29/2007 03:07:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so it looks like you make it focus on a target module
[05/29/2007 03:07:12 PM] Alex Markov: look at points 1-5 in leads protocol
[05/29/2007 03:07:23 PM] Alex Markov: can we make that more effecient?
[05/29/2007 03:07:27 PM] Alex Markov: with workflows?
[05/29/2007 03:07:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not more efficient, but we can make it so sugar requires these steps be taken
[05/29/2007 03:07:52 PM] Alex Markov: because in the next month we are gonna start marketing.
[05/29/2007 03:08:07 PM] Alex Markov: so when leads come in... we gonna have the designate PMs to handle those leads
[05/29/2007 03:08:22 PM] Alex Markov: stuff like that should hopeuflly be managed by sugar
[05/29/2007 03:08:30 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its like a sugar workflow, basically the same thing we have written up, but each step happens when the task before it is completed
[05/29/2007 03:08:35 PM] Alex Markov: maybe we dont need all those layers right now
[05/29/2007 03:08:43 PM] Alex Markov: what do u think?
[05/29/2007 03:08:58 PM] Alex Markov: maybe we only need 1 or two layers for now since we dont have multiple HPMs and PMs
[05/29/2007 03:09:07 PM] Alex Markov: maybe i got ahead of ourselves when writing that protocol
[05/29/2007 03:09:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well it seems like we will need to do a lot of modifying the modules
[05/29/2007 03:09:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: to make it work better for us
[05/29/2007 03:09:36 PM] Alex Markov: explain
[05/29/2007 03:09:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the page i am on right now is the workflow manager, i created a workflow focused on accounts right
[05/29/2007 03:10:21 PM] Alex Markov: yeah. explain how its working
[05/29/2007 03:10:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i would add actions that relate to our leads protocol that say, when we get a lead and we want to make that lead active, notify our employee of this message telling them what to do next
[05/29/2007 03:11:23 PM] Alex Markov: oh wow. i didnt see all those conditions
[05/29/2007 03:11:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so when we change and account from a lead, to active we tell them to contact the lead with the following information
[05/29/2007 03:11:33 PM] Alex Markov: like id dint even see options for conditions
[05/29/2007 03:11:35 PM] Alex Markov: that is rly cool
[05/29/2007 03:11:51 PM] Alex Markov: that is so COOL
[05/29/2007 03:12:04 PM] Alex Markov: i think we need to setup workflows right away
[05/29/2007 03:12:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok i will keep playing around with it
[05/29/2007 03:12:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but lets finish up this meeting
[05/29/2007 03:12:29 PM] Alex Markov: because 1. we nee to start fiddling with them to learn their true potential. and 2. eventually they will make thing svery effecienyt
[05/29/2007 03:12:34 PM] Alex Markov: well thats it. 
[05/29/2007 03:12:41 PM] Alex Markov: we covered all topics
[05/29/2007 03:12:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/29/2007 03:13:56 PM] Alex Markov: can you setup workflows for our leads protocol
[05/29/2007 03:14:07 PM] Alex Markov: and then we can talk about it
[05/29/2007 03:14:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok let me figure out a few things
[05/29/2007 03:14:23 PM] Alex Markov: the sooner all these little thigns are done the sooner we can jsut start doing clients full force
[05/29/2007 03:14:32 PM] Alex Markov: and start making monies
[05/29/2007 03:14:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yay
[05/29/2007 03:14:42 PM] Alex Markov: i gotta work on our marketing protocols right now
[05/29/2007 03:14:46 PM] Alex Markov: to get rdy for friday meeting
[05/29/2007 03:14:48 PM] Alex Markov: :P
[05/29/2007 03:16:19 PM] Alex Markov: rps meeting 3 was a success :P
[05/29/2007 03:16:46 PM] Alex Markov: we are gonna start having a weekly kickoff meeting
[05/29/2007 03:16:58 PM] Alex Markov: 9am monday ussually
[05/29/2007 03:17:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok help me with this
[05/29/2007 03:17:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: first you create a lead right?
[05/29/2007 03:17:37 PM] Alex Markov: what should we call our weekly kickoff meetings
[05/29/2007 03:17:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you change on the lead when we decide to work with them?
[05/29/2007 03:17:49 PM] Alex Markov: ummmm
[05/29/2007 03:18:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the status?
[05/29/2007 03:18:05 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/29/2007 03:18:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you convert it to contact?
[05/29/2007 03:18:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so either converted or assigned?
[05/29/2007 03:18:16 PM] Alex Markov: a) If lead is receptive 
-Assign the lead to a PM 
-Update lead status to 'Converted' 
-Convert Lead: 

[05/29/2007 03:18:20 PM] Alex Markov: *Create an account 
Fill this out as best as you can. 
 
*Create a contact 
Fill this out as best as you can.
[05/29/2007 03:18:30 PM] Alex Markov: and it will create an opportunity automatically
[05/29/2007 03:18:35 PM] Alex Markov: *Create an opportunity 
-Expected Close Date: Make a very safe estimate 
-Sales Stage: Choose sales stage that is appropriate 
-Amount: Choose a very safe amount that the lead may produce

[05/29/2007 05:07:43 PM] Alex Markov: like we need a team in the company to districubte leads
[05/29/2007 05:07:49 PM] Alex Markov: so when a new lead is plugged in
[05/29/2007 05:07:54 PM] Alex Markov: that team gets a notice
[05/29/2007 05:08:05 PM] Alex Markov: and assigns it to a certain hpm

[05/29/2007 05:08:32 PM] Alex Markov: this is definetly a good start
[05/29/2007 05:08:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we don't have the man power for that yet
[05/29/2007 05:09:15 PM] Alex Markov: we need to do opportunity too
[05/29/2007 05:09:44 PM] Alex Markov: i think at every stage of the opportunity... or all relevant stages. the HPM of that project gets notified
[05/29/2007 05:09:59 PM] Alex Markov: to look over the progress of the opp
[05/29/2007 05:10:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah

[05/29/2007 05:10:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should sell one to my dad
[05/29/2007 05:10:55 PM] Alex Markov: plus we get 5 free licenses ourselves
[05/29/2007 05:11:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do we have to get certified to train people to use sugar?

[05/30/2007 10:09:29 AM] Alex Markov: we should give them like a big packet worth of shit like our operations.... their support options...
[05/30/2007 10:09:36 AM] Alex Markov: company history
[05/30/2007 10:09:49 AM] Alex Markov: like a welcome letter
[05/30/2007 10:09:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: exactly, i have notes on that under Contract Notes
[05/30/2007 10:09:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: in a different page
[05/30/2007 10:10:09 AM] Alex Markov: im reading it now
[05/30/2007 10:10:48 AM] Alex Markov: the contract we use is a standard contract from a web design kit we bought
[05/30/2007 10:11:01 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.sitepoint.com/books/freelance1/)http://www.sitepoint.com/books/freelance1/
[05/30/2007 10:11:07 AM] Alex Markov: this book is FANTASTIC
[05/30/2007 10:11:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah its that thing that lists out all the features and stuff
[05/30/2007 10:11:22 AM] Alex Markov: but eventually we need to show it to a lawyer
[05/30/2007 10:11:27 AM] Alex Markov: no the legal terms i mean
[05/30/2007 10:11:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are legal terms in the contract now?
[05/30/2007 10:11:40 AM] Alex Markov: the legal terms part of the contract is a standard version
[05/30/2007 10:11:47 AM] Alex Markov: we editied it tho. like we took sections out and changed wording
[05/30/2007 10:11:53 AM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/30/2007 10:11:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 10:12:07 AM] Alex Markov: the PO does not have prices or legal terms (Project overview) 
[05/30/2007 10:12:13 AM] Alex Markov: the PC has prices and legal terms
[05/30/2007 10:12:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see thats where i think we should divide up the documents
[05/30/2007 10:13:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the phase should be seperate from the contract, and the phase is what contains prices
[05/30/2007 10:13:32 AM] Alex Markov: sec phone 5min. sry bro
[05/30/2007 10:13:35 AM] Alex Markov: read it over
[05/30/2007 10:13:43 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the contract should reference the phase
[05/30/2007 10:13:48 AM] Alex Markov: yeah
[05/30/2007 10:14:23 AM] Alex Markov: brb
[05/30/2007 10:15:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, i'mma leave some praises
[05/30/2007 10:16:09 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think the terms and conditions looks great, that's exactly what i had in mind
[05/30/2007 10:17:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think that we need two more sections added to the actual terms of agreement, Phase, which explains all the work described in the phase will be completed as a part of the price that we list to them, and also Operations, which describes every single step of the project in great detail
[05/30/2007 10:19:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so for each client we still have to make an individual phase, and we still have all the form where they sign and agree at the bottom, but i don't think this describes enough of how each step works, things like what kind of changes they are allowed to make, or how they must meet with us to give feedback when we start development
[05/30/2007 10:20:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or how their site will only exist under a development domain name until the final payment has processed
[05/30/2007 10:21:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and that payment terms is definitely not detailed enough, thats the smallest section on the page, LOL it should be the largest and most precise
[05/30/2007 10:24:55 AM] Alex Markov: back sorry
[05/30/2007 10:25:40 AM] Alex Markov: yeah we need to create a project protocol
[05/30/2007 10:25:55 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/arizona-web-design/design-process/)http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/arizona-web-design/design-process/
[05/30/2007 10:26:06 AM] Alex Markov: bobby's is all bullshit because he doesnt follow it and its too complex
[05/30/2007 10:26:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/30/2007 10:26:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks like it
[05/30/2007 10:26:53 AM] Alex Markov: once we define our new project protocol we will add it into the contract
[05/30/2007 10:26:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am not saying it should be complex, i am saying the document will be huge because it will be very detailed, so the client can understand it
[05/30/2007 10:27:57 AM] Alex Markov: the way we want to start designing nowadays is we want to do everything we can at once
[05/30/2007 10:28:05 AM] Alex Markov: this is the way all future projects will be done
[05/30/2007 10:28:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so, i am glad to see that we do have a terms and conditions, i was almost worried
[05/30/2007 10:28:22 AM] Alex Markov: we will start logo template content writing and software installation all at once
[05/30/2007 10:28:27 AM] Alex Markov: :)
[05/30/2007 10:28:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah exactly
[05/30/2007 10:28:38 AM] Alex Markov: then once tempalte is done we do xhtml
[05/30/2007 10:28:50 AM] Alex Markov: then ocne that is done we make the pages and integrate the software into it
[05/30/2007 10:29:06 AM] Alex Markov: so how do we divide that into the phases
[05/30/2007 10:29:13 AM] Alex Markov: and content writing will be done through out the whole project
[05/30/2007 10:29:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/30/2007 10:29:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when we finally do get a lawyer to look over it, since he is in ohio he is not allowed to get paid for any work he does on it
[05/30/2007 10:30:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and he is a very busy person so we need to have this well prepared for him
[05/30/2007 10:30:17 AM] Alex Markov: thats later on. 
[05/30/2007 10:30:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok, but it is an open option so whenever we are ready i can send it over to him
[05/30/2007 10:30:59 AM] Alex Markov: so we need to schedule a meeting, between me bobby and u... to discuss the project process
[05/30/2007 10:31:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/30/2007 10:31:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so moving on
[05/30/2007 10:31:53 AM] Alex Markov: we have one major hole in our operation right now. how we deal with specialists
[05/30/2007 10:32:05 AM] Alex Markov: we need a standard writeup for every type of specialist
[05/30/2007 10:32:29 AM] Alex Markov: and we need to designate a place where all specialist discussions are done
[05/30/2007 10:32:35 AM] Alex Markov: i think maybe we should do it in the forum
[05/30/2007 10:32:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree
[05/30/2007 10:32:58 AM] Alex Markov: now the way we define sub project tasks
[05/30/2007 10:33:02 AM] Alex Markov: is we call them project elements
[05/30/2007 10:33:03 AM] Alex Markov: PEs
[05/30/2007 10:33:05 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=84)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=84
[05/30/2007 10:33:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we had an svn available the specialist could always go grab the project specs off that
[05/30/2007 10:33:16 AM] Alex Markov: we have two protcols for that
[05/30/2007 10:33:45 AM] Alex Markov: i dont know if specialsits wil ever get access to the svn
[05/30/2007 10:33:46 AM] Alex Markov: maybe
[05/30/2007 10:33:53 AM] Alex Markov: in the forum we can control their permissions
[05/30/2007 10:34:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well we will talk about it more tomorrow, but i think the way i have permissions set up for the svn now should work for specialists too
[05/30/2007 10:34:45 AM] Alex Markov: well also i prefer not to do a writeup in ms word
[05/30/2007 10:34:51 AM] Alex Markov: i think the forum is better for that
[05/30/2007 10:34:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes i agree
[05/30/2007 10:35:21 AM] Alex Markov: but we need to standardize how to writeup a PHP job for example
[05/30/2007 10:35:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but we are still giving that writeup to the client?
[05/30/2007 10:35:26 AM] Alex Markov: no we are not
[05/30/2007 10:35:32 AM] Alex Markov: the writeups are only for specialists
[05/30/2007 10:35:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 10:35:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sounds good
[05/30/2007 10:35:41 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=100)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=100
[05/30/2007 10:35:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think the forum would be perfect for that
[05/30/2007 10:35:49 AM] Alex Markov: like this is an example of a PSD Template writeup
[05/30/2007 10:36:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: looks good
[05/30/2007 10:37:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we need a meeting for project protocol, and that will include placement of project elements?
[05/30/2007 10:38:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: want to do this with robert?
[05/30/2007 10:38:11 AM] Alex Markov: from now on we will refer to project element writeups as PEW
[05/30/2007 10:38:17 AM] Alex Markov: yes we need bobby there
[05/30/2007 10:38:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or have a seperate meeting for handling specialists?
[05/30/2007 10:38:30 AM] Alex Markov: we need to have a separate meeting for specialists
[05/30/2007 10:38:37 AM] Alex Markov: after we do the project pahse meeting
[05/30/2007 10:38:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: robert won't even be available until next week
[05/30/2007 10:39:48 AM] Alex Markov: ill talk to him
[05/30/2007 10:39:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 10:40:02 AM] Alex Markov: sec phone
[05/30/2007 10:40:17 AM] Alex Markov: i need a secratary
[05/30/2007 10:40:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol ye
[05/30/2007 10:40:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ah
[05/30/2007 10:43:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lagged
[05/30/2007 10:45:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol tked too much and got kicked
[05/30/2007 10:47:49 AM] Alex Markov: back
[05/30/2007 10:47:59 AM] Alex Markov: i didnt see anything u typed if u typed
[05/30/2007 10:48:40 AM] Alex Markov: moving on
[05/30/2007 10:48:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 10:49:38 AM] Alex Markov: ill schedule our meeting later todsay hen i find out bobby's schedule
[05/30/2007 10:49:43 AM] Alex Markov: to discuss the phases
[05/30/2007 10:49:50 AM] Alex Markov: then we will write those into the PC
[05/30/2007 10:49:59 AM] Alex Markov: and will customize sugar'
[05/30/2007 10:50:04 AM] Alex Markov: to match our plans
[05/30/2007 10:51:07 AM] Alex Markov: operation of meetings. i forget what exactly that is lol
[05/30/2007 10:51:17 AM] Alex Markov: we need to be more specific with meeting operations i think
[05/30/2007 10:51:29 AM] Alex Markov: from now on we must write as many notes into the meeting as possible
[05/30/2007 10:51:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/30/2007 10:51:50 AM] Alex Markov: let me read ur notes on allocation of authority
[05/30/2007 10:51:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: good idea
[05/30/2007 10:52:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i address some issues we have in meetings
[05/30/2007 10:56:47 AM] Alex Markov: i am gonna send that allocation of authority thing to robert. i think u made very good points and are logically correct on all fronts
[05/30/2007 10:56:53 AM] Alex Markov: good job. i am very impressed
[05/30/2007 10:57:08 AM] Alex Markov: now what we need to do is create a protocol on how to schedule meetings
[05/30/2007 10:57:14 AM] Alex Markov: u basically spelled it out there
[05/30/2007 10:57:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thanks, i hope that robert prepares a proper rebuttal because i know he will disagree with some of the topics
[05/30/2007 10:57:33 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=55)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=55
[05/30/2007 10:57:41 AM] Alex Markov: i want you to create that protocol in that forum
[05/30/2007 10:58:08 AM] Alex Markov: just edit that whole thing and take out the specific examples. 
[05/30/2007 10:58:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: protocol for scheduling meetings?
[05/30/2007 10:58:31 AM] Alex Markov: if u want me to do it i will
[05/30/2007 10:58:37 AM] Alex Markov: no for organizing meetings
[05/30/2007 10:58:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh ok
[05/30/2007 10:58:42 AM] Alex Markov: but u already wroteit up so well
[05/30/2007 10:58:48 AM] Alex Markov: ill do it if u want
[05/30/2007 10:58:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either way i don't mind
[05/30/2007 10:59:02 AM] Alex Markov: i dont want u to feel like u get more work for bringing up rly good points
[05/30/2007 10:59:10 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to work on the protocol protocol first
[05/30/2007 10:59:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i can do the meeting one too
[05/30/2007 10:59:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll put it in the forum, but it might take me until next meeting to finish all these up today

-nyb skin 
-image program research 
-workflow announcements- must include lead/opp/project name that it refers too 
-protocol for protocols 
-protocol for meetings 

[05/30/2007 11:00:16 AM] Alex Markov: dont spend too much time on the protocol for meetings
[05/30/2007 11:00:32 AM] Alex Markov: just make a post for it.... and copy and paste that whole chunk into it
[05/30/2007 11:00:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok is that my agenda for today?
[05/30/2007 11:00:35 AM] Alex Markov: and edit it slightly
[05/30/2007 11:00:50 AM] Alex Markov: yes
[05/30/2007 11:00:52 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 11:01:18 AM] Alex Markov: u are gonna get $200 for the nyb skin
[05/30/2007 11:01:31 AM] Alex Markov: and then research the image shit and then we will come up with a price for tht
[05/30/2007 11:01:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok sounds good
[05/30/2007 11:02:00 AM] Alex Markov: i am gonna send that over to bobby

[05/30/2007 04:46:31 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is an admin section for xcart right?
[05/30/2007 04:47:37 PM] Alex Markov: info is in the pmxp
[05/30/2007 04:47:54 PM] Alex Markov: to access a client db... u gotta open the project management db
[05/30/2007 04:48:14 PM] Alex Markov: to get the individual passwords for the clients
[05/30/2007 04:48:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/30/2007 04:48:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/30/2007 05:03:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: damnit
[05/30/2007 05:04:04 PM] Alex Markov: yo
[05/30/2007 05:04:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really wish robert would have finished this shit up last weekend like he said he would
[05/30/2007 05:04:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is just stuff here that i don't know how to do
[05/30/2007 05:04:42 PM] Alex Markov: i agree
[05/30/2007 05:05:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have never worked with xcart before, and i am removing a lot of features that the template does not have, so even if the client turns them on in the admin section they will not display
[05/30/2007 05:05:27 PM] Alex Markov: he is pissing me off 
[05/30/2007 05:05:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think i am just making it worse and i should start over from the beginning
[05/30/2007 05:05:45 PM] Alex Markov: put the skin on hold until u hear from him
[05/30/2007 05:06:09 PM] Alex Markov: work on the other stuff
[05/30/2007 05:06:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this stuff just isn't working, i think we should have had our template designer build the template around xcart instead of doing them seperately
[05/30/2007 05:08:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: found the thumbnail program i was thinking of

[05/30/2007 05:09:08 PM] Alex Markov: ok ill look at it a little later
[05/30/2007 05:09:20 PM] Alex Markov: i have to go to dinner with my mom and then i have a meeting

[06/04/2007 09:20:37 PM] Alex Markov: u think it will work and everything
[06/04/2007 09:20:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/04/2007 09:20:57 PM] Alex Markov: what do u need to go ahead with isntallation?
[06/04/2007 09:21:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i made a list
[06/04/2007 09:21:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: just a user account
[06/04/2007 09:21:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: like we give to our clients and will use for ourself
[06/04/2007 09:21:38 PM] Alex Markov: explain
[06/04/2007 09:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert understands he just doesn't want to do it
[06/04/2007 09:22:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the server he have a user rps
[06/04/2007 09:22:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and nyb
[06/04/2007 09:22:08 PM] Alex Markov: our clients are gonna have access to svn?
[06/04/2007 09:22:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and all our clients have a username
[06/04/2007 09:22:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: NO
[06/04/2007 09:22:18 PM] Alex Markov: oh ok
[06/04/2007 09:22:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats not what i am sayig
[06/04/2007 09:22:22 PM] Alex Markov: a cpanel account?
[06/04/2007 09:22:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just need a user account like the one we use
[06/04/2007 09:22:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it includes all that stuff
[06/04/2007 09:22:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: cpanel and a website and everything
[06/04/2007 09:23:11 PM] Alex Markov: ok hopefully we start it this week
[06/04/2007 09:23:59 PM] Alex Markov: document management
[06/04/2007 09:24:20 PM] Alex Markov: meeting notes will not be in svn
[06/04/2007 09:24:22 PM] Alex Markov: in sugar
[06/04/2007 09:24:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:24:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought i explained this
[06/04/2007 09:24:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: look we are not going to half ass it
[06/04/2007 09:25:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are going to implement it we will integrate it into everything
[06/04/2007 09:25:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: none of those sugar documents bullshit
[06/04/2007 09:25:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: we can still use the document manager in sugar
[06/04/2007 09:25:50 PM] Alex Markov: no i agree. we will use it for most things. sugar docuements is also not effecient
[06/04/2007 09:25:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will just make a new change and insert the link to it in the svn instead of the actual file
[06/04/2007 09:26:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be efficient
[06/04/2007 09:26:06 PM] Alex Markov: however... meeting notes will go into sugar under meetings
[06/04/2007 09:26:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/04/2007 09:26:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: like what we currently do
[06/04/2007 09:26:27 PM] Alex Markov: yeah
[06/04/2007 09:26:34 PM] Alex Markov: ither than that all docuements will go into svn
[06/04/2007 09:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what is the problem?
[06/04/2007 09:26:40 PM] Alex Markov: protcools in forums
[06/04/2007 09:26:47 PM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "jfj78.tmp.jpg": c:\program files\trillian\users\default\cache\MSN-theday12701@hotmail.com-thumb17.png
[06/04/2007 09:26:52 PM] Alex Markov: Organization 
Meeting Notes 
Documents on Filesystem 

[06/04/2007 09:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes until we reach a final version
[06/04/2007 09:27:00 PM] Alex Markov: u have meeting noteslisted under organization
[06/04/2007 09:27:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and everyone comments on it
[06/04/2007 09:27:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: document management is not just SVN stuff
[06/04/2007 09:27:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is the protocol for all of that
[06/04/2007 09:27:32 PM] Alex Markov: oo ok
[06/04/2007 09:27:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will explain that protocols go in the forum
[06/04/2007 09:27:54 PM] Alex Markov: oh u put general etiquette. u should have put protcools
[06/04/2007 09:27:56 PM] Alex Markov: ok i udnerstand now
[06/04/2007 09:27:58 PM] Alex Markov: good stuff
[06/04/2007 09:28:04 PM] Alex Markov: :)
[06/04/2007 09:28:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but when we rewrite it and come out with a final version to release to other departments it should be put under the svn
[06/04/2007 09:28:09 PM] Alex Markov: keep that list
[06/04/2007 09:28:28 PM] Alex Markov: well we need to think about this too. corporations have like a massvie employees handbook
[06/04/2007 09:28:37 PM] Alex Markov: where like final protocols go
[06/04/2007 09:28:48 PM] Alex Markov: i was thinking we make one in adobe acroba professional
[06/04/2007 09:28:50 PM] Alex Markov: eventually
[06/04/2007 09:28:55 PM] Alex Markov: once protocols are all ironed out in the forums
[06/04/2007 09:29:15 PM] Alex Markov: then when people want to refer to a protocol and disucss it in the forum they will just copy and paste it in there and give its reference #
[06/04/2007 09:29:32 PM] Alex Markov: i have adobe acrobat pro but i have used it very little
[06/04/2007 09:29:46 PM] Alex Markov: what do u think?
[06/04/2007 09:29:50 PM] Alex Markov: keep it in mind
[06/04/2007 09:29:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[06/04/2007 09:29:59 PM] Alex Markov: so we can also print it
[06/04/2007 09:30:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but they don't look as nice in the forum
[06/04/2007 09:30:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that the forum should be for like the beta version of protocols
[06/04/2007 09:30:22 PM] Alex Markov: forum is only for discussion eventually
[06/04/2007 09:30:25 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[06/04/2007 09:30:31 PM] Alex Markov: to start it is for beta protocols
[06/04/2007 09:30:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: then they will be fixed up in word and stored in SVN and converted to PDF and stored and possibly printed as well
[06/04/2007 09:30:41 PM] Alex Markov: protocols can be born in the forum like a nursery
[06/04/2007 09:30:57 PM] Alex Markov: we need all protocols in 1 major documenet
[06/04/2007 09:32:28 PM] Alex Markov: explain ur notes about protocol protocol
[06/04/2007 09:33:09 PM] Alex Markov: me and bobby decided that instead of i we gonna use r
[06/04/2007 09:33:16 PM] Alex Markov: so like rMeetings instead of iMeetings
[06/04/2007 09:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:33:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: protocol protocol just needs bullets, but that is all the notes i could come up with about it
[06/04/2007 09:33:47 PM] Alex Markov: i like protocol protocols
[06/04/2007 09:33:52 PM] Alex Markov: implement it.
[06/04/2007 09:34:09 PM] Alex Markov: u are better to organizeit mentally because u are a programmer. protocols are like internal programming for a company
[06/04/2007 09:34:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/04/2007 09:34:28 PM] Alex Markov: create the post in the forum
[06/04/2007 09:34:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:34:39 PM] Alex Markov: and we will start making protocols based on your structure
[06/04/2007 09:34:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:35:41 PM] Alex Markov: wow brian
[06/04/2007 09:35:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: what?
[06/04/2007 09:36:13 PM] Alex Markov: meeting protocol is very good
[06/04/2007 09:36:34 PM] Alex Markov: reading still
[06/04/2007 09:36:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad you think so
[06/04/2007 09:37:20 PM] Alex Markov: after u put protocols protocols in the forum]
[06/04/2007 09:37:22 PM] Alex Markov: put that meeting protocol in
[06/04/2007 09:37:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:37:42 PM] Alex Markov: and if ANY of us acts against the meeting protocol. we just cite it and tell them tht they are not following protocol
[06/04/2007 09:37:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/04/2007 09:37:56 PM] Alex Markov: good stuff!

[06/04/2007 09:38:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to work on the template still
[06/04/2007 09:38:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i configured it so far to be closed to the template so i wouldn't mess it up again
[06/04/2007 09:38:38 PM] Alex Markov: the reaosn i told u not to touch it was i was working on some shit with client
[06/04/2007 09:38:45 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.brightonbeautysupply.com/)http://www.brightonbeautysupply.com/
[06/04/2007 09:38:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was reset like 5 days ago
[06/04/2007 09:39:00 PM] Alex Markov: there is one feature i want to see if we can add. client rly wants it and i rly think it is worthit
[06/04/2007 09:39:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/04/2007 09:39:18 PM] Alex Markov: look at the shop by brand
[06/04/2007 09:39:28 PM] Alex Markov: we need manufacturers to be in a drop down menu
[06/04/2007 09:39:36 PM] Alex Markov: do u think that is possible
[06/04/2007 09:39:43 PM] Alex Markov: and it needs to be on top of the categories
[06/04/2007 09:40:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: let me get the template the way it is designed first, then we can add on to it
[06/04/2007 09:40:30 PM] Alex Markov: do u think that is possible
[06/04/2007 09:40:34 PM] Alex Markov: if it costs more we can charge client
[06/04/2007 09:40:40 PM] Alex Markov: do u understand what i mean?
[06/04/2007 09:40:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: the brand drop down?
[06/04/2007 09:40:47 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/04/2007 09:40:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that should be possible
[06/04/2007 09:41:00 PM] Alex Markov: so instead of manufaturers here: (Link: http://nybeauty.com)http://nybeauty.com
[06/04/2007 09:41:11 PM] Alex Markov: we need manufacturers on top of categories

[06/04/2007 09:43:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[06/05/2007 02:29:24 PM] Alex Markov: uve only been involved for a few months. me and bobby have been planning and working on RPS for like 2 years. granted we were both in college so we were not working full time, but we still put alot of time and effort into it. i put probably $20,000 into the comapny our of my personal funds already 

[06/05/2007 02:29:35 PM] Alex Markov: so dont get mad that u dont have ur fingers in everything yet
[06/05/2007 02:29:51 PM] Alex Markov: because u already are more involved than i ever imagined involving anyone
[06/05/2007 02:29:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am basing that statement off knowledge
[06/05/2007 02:30:05 PM] Alex Markov: u alreayd know more than anyone about rps

[06/05/2007 02:30:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know linux better then him, but not as well as the admins do
[06/05/2007 02:31:05 PM] Alex Markov: its ok bro. we are a team. i dont know how to program at all. i can only read html and css and edit it with lots of trial and error
[06/05/2007 02:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i could certainly learn what i need to know to be an admin in a relatively short amount of time
[06/05/2007 02:31:41 PM] Alex Markov: give it time. we never planned to have anyone else join us on a partner level like you
[06/05/2007 02:31:58 PM] Alex Markov: so we are easing you in slowly because its a big change for us
[06/05/2007 02:32:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i am glad you invited me to be part of this, i know i can contribute to taking this company far
[06/05/2007 02:32:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we really should pay attention to that allocation of authority document i wrote
[06/05/2007 02:32:59 PM] Alex Markov: yes we will
[06/05/2007 02:32:59 PM] Alex Markov: put them in the forums after nyb is done

[06/05/2007 02:34:41 PM] Alex Markov: yeah the more u are involved the happier i am that we decided to bring you in. i think if we all just keep working hard at it all. we will have such a crazy cool company. and it will be oursss muahahahahah'
[06/05/2007 02:35:10 PM] Alex Markov: i went through about a foot of paperwork today. maybe more. and filed it in our huge company filling cabinet

[06/05/2007 02:35:28 PM] Alex Markov: with labels and stuff

[06/05/2007 04:26:30 PM] Alex Markov: fucking hot
[06/05/2007 04:27:05 PM] Alex Markov: and make that drop down wider... and instead of it having defualt text say "Manufacturers... have it say "Select Manufacturer"
[06/05/2007 04:27:23 PM] Alex Markov: can we add some kind of effect to the drop down like we have effect for the sexy text boxes for jambonie?
[06/05/2007 04:27:54 PM] Alex Markov: make it a little wider
[06/05/2007 04:27:59 PM] Alex Markov: so it fills that whole box

[06/05/2007 04:29:10 PM] Alex Markov: hehehe
[06/05/2007 04:29:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it makes it look ugly, and random ass colors, and just blinds me when i look at it
[06/05/2007 04:29:24 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[06/05/2007 04:30:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have an auto fill plugin so whenever i try to see it all those fucking colors don't look right with the autofill because the plugin changes the background color of the fields

[06/06/2007 01:01:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but before we start more projects with clients we need to start working on that document, one that explains everything down the details of why returning the evaluation forms is important
[06/06/2007 01:02:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so there will be no question as to what step happens next, it might be detailed enough for us in the project protocol, but we need to have sometime similar that we can give to the client that's really well described
[06/06/2007 01:06:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: want to help me go through nyb and pick out the corrections

[06/08/2007 09:13:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: except for the thumbnails there is nothing i can do about the blurry

[06/08/2007 09:13:54 AM] Alex Markov: that is the real image size
[06/08/2007 09:14:55 AM] Alex Markov: what is it doing?
[06/08/2007 09:15:06 AM] Alex Markov: is it just set to a certain size? and we need to make thumbnails that exact size?
[06/08/2007 09:17:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes they need to be exact size but that size is way to big
[06/08/2007 09:17:07 AM] Alex Markov: i agree
[06/08/2007 09:17:13 AM] Alex Markov: any way to kmake the standard thumbnails smaller?
[06/08/2007 09:17:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need to make the actual pictures the size it should be
[06/08/2007 09:17:32 AM] Alex Markov: i understand, but i would rather thumbnails be this size

[06/08/2007 09:17:37 AM] Alex Markov: i think thats 100x100
[06/08/2007 09:19:42 AM] Alex Markov: its not 100x100. but i think all thumbnails should be 100x100 because that is how wide the add to cart button is
[06/08/2007 09:20:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/08/2007 09:20:50 AM] Alex Markov: i am sure it is possible to standardize them
[06/08/2007 09:25:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: hey you know what you should do
[06/08/2007 09:25:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: write an email to xcart saying we will not buy any more of their product until they make an xhtml compliant skin
[06/08/2007 09:25:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is ridiculous
[06/08/2007 09:27:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[06/08/2007 09:29:37 AM] Alex Markov: LOL
[06/08/2007 09:29:40 AM] Alex Markov: sorry phone calls left and right
[06/08/2007 09:31:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'm serious, write them hate mail
[06/08/2007 09:31:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: its 2007, we follow standards now
[06/08/2007 09:37:49 AM] Alex Markov: Dear Xcart Staff, 
 
My name is Alex Markov and I am head project manager for Red Pepper Solutions. We are a web development, marketing, and consulting firm from New York city. I want to make a formal request that you make X-Cart XHTML compliant. X-Cart is the primary ecommerce software that we setup for our client, and my programmers constantly struggle with it because we skin all our sites with xh
[06/08/2007 09:38:14 AM] Alex Markov: xhtml/css.  
 
It is 2007 and X-Cart should be in full compliance with XHTML and CSS standards. Please make the effort to bring X-Cart up to date as soon as possible. 
 
Thank you, 
Alex Markov 
Head Project Manager 
Red Pepper Solutions 

[06/08/2007 09:38:28 AM] Alex Markov: anything else i should say

[06/08/2007 09:39:33 AM] Alex Markov: sent
[06/08/2007 09:39:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably good to leave the threat out so they don't tell us to fuck off like we would to one of our clients
[06/08/2007 09:40:04 AM] Alex Markov: :) we must always act diplomatically. burning bridges  will not get us anywhere
[06/08/2007 09:40:12 AM] Alex Markov: did u ever see the movie the persuit of happiness

[06/08/2007 09:40:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that was a good movie
[06/08/2007 09:40:57 AM] Alex Markov: no matter what, if its rejection or rudeness or whatever, we must always thank people for their time and move on
[06/08/2007 09:41:24 AM] Alex Markov: we must maintain the attitude like "well it is your loss that you do not do business with us, hopefully in the future you will see that we are the best. but for now, thank you for your time"
[06/08/2007 09:41:32 AM] Alex Markov: in everything we do
[06/08/2007 09:41:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/08/2007 09:42:02 AM] Alex Markov: if someone (client, vendor, specilaist, or whoever) works with us, we must have the attitude like "they work with the right firm"
[06/08/2007 09:42:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: but this non compliant skin is a pretty big deal, i hope we get the response we are looking for
[06/08/2007 09:42:19 AM] Alex Markov: we msut be confident, and polite, and diplomatic
[06/08/2007 09:42:21 AM] Alex Markov: ok enough ranting
[06/08/2007 09:42:29 AM] Alex Markov: i agree
[06/08/2007 09:42:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: its not even that hard to do once you get into it, i am surprised they haven't put time into it sooner

[06/11/2007 02:05:53 PM] Alex Markov: no
[06/11/2007 02:06:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't get any work done during our meetings
[06/11/2007 02:06:04 PM] Alex Markov: but that is the same as us not saying good bye on the phone and jsut hanging up
[06/11/2007 02:06:23 PM] Alex Markov: it can be somewhat percieved as rude. 
[06/11/2007 02:06:27 PM] Alex Markov: i know u dont mean it
[06/11/2007 02:06:40 PM] Alex Markov: just stay until we all say ok

[06/11/2007 02:09:20 PM] Alex Markov: should we open new chats for separate topics?
[06/11/2007 02:10:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am sorry you guys feel like "my attitude" isn't constructive, but i just want you to know that i get annoyed when i feel like i've wasted time
[06/11/2007 02:10:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, don't open another chat, because i am going to go work on nyb now
[06/11/2007 02:11:26 PM] Alex Markov: non i mean should we open new chat windows while in meeting disucssing new topics?
[06/11/2007 02:11:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i waste at least a half and hour for every hour we have a meeting
[06/11/2007 02:11:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: just post changes in the forum
[06/11/2007 02:11:56 PM] Alex Markov: just have patience brian. our meetings are online and are not as effecient as if we were in the same room. and we are all rly busy
[06/11/2007 02:11:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: send robert the link to and post fixes
[06/11/2007 02:11:59 PM] Alex Markov: ok will do
[06/11/2007 02:12:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should be doing phone conferences
[06/11/2007 02:13:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: why did we spend all that time discussing HOW to install svn?  when it was already installed
[06/11/2007 02:13:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys have so little faith in my knowledge its almost sickening
[06/11/2007 02:13:38 PM] Alex Markov: it needed to be clarified
[06/11/2007 02:13:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've worked in and IT department, at my fathers company AND for the school
[06/11/2007 02:14:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not some little specialist that doesn't know how things work
[06/11/2007 02:15:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might not know how to run a business, but i know a lot more about running a server then robert does
[06/11/2007 02:15:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i might not know our exact specifications, but that would take about as much time for me to figure out as we spend arguing about petty little things
[06/11/2007 02:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: if the manager for my dads IT department told him every little thing he changed, my dad would fire him

[06/11/2007 02:20:03 PM] Alex Markov: but you are absolutly right
[06/11/2007 02:20:03 PM] Alex Markov: you also have to put yourself into mine and boby's shoes. this has been lkike our baby. we never planned for you to get so involved. but we are both glad that u did

[06/11/2007 02:21:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just think we need to be more of a moving machine, like a train, right now we are not moving, i sent you the next steps a week and a half ago, and we are just getting around to making the accounts now?
[06/11/2007 02:21:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not the stupid questions that bother me, its the misunderstandings

[06/11/2007 02:22:03 PM] Alex Markov: we need to start scheduling more follow up meetings more frequently
[06/11/2007 02:22:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert it so set in doing things his way, and there are things that i just don't know how to explain to him to get him to understand that we are on the same page
[06/11/2007 02:24:14 PM] Alex Markov: just be patient. robert will learn
[06/11/2007 02:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahaha

[06/12/2007 12:37:42 PM] Alex Markov: yeah its like $200-$300 for a custom job from our template designers

[06/12/2007 02:28:54 PM] Alex Markov: Brian Cullinan says: 
ok how about you do what you need to, and i'll do what i need to
[06/12/2007 02:29:03 PM] Alex Markov: things like that just cause tension bro
[06/12/2007 02:29:12 PM] Alex Markov: come on
[06/12/2007 02:29:21 PM] Alex Markov: would u want me to ever reply to u like that?
[06/12/2007 02:29:27 PM] Alex Markov: regardless of circumstances?
[06/12/2007 02:29:29 PM] Alex Markov: we are a team
[06/12/2007 02:29:37 PM] Alex Markov: Brian Cullinan says: 
give me a minute and a please and i might check my email for you
[06/12/2007 02:29:53 PM] Alex Markov: i know bobby can sometimes be too tense too
[06/12/2007 02:29:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, we are not acting like a team
[06/12/2007 02:30:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are acting like he gives me orders and tells me how i should be doing things
[06/12/2007 02:30:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats why i'd love to have an svn
[06/12/2007 02:30:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we have a place to store documents
[06/12/2007 02:30:48 PM] Alex Markov: we all give each other orders. dont take it personally. if in the future u need me to do something u jsut tell me and i should just do it
[06/12/2007 02:30:55 PM] Alex Markov: its not orders
[06/12/2007 02:31:00 PM] Alex Markov: its just shit that needs to be done
[06/12/2007 02:31:06 PM] Alex Markov: plain and simple
[06/12/2007 02:31:54 PM] Alex Markov: i understand all our systems ar enot fully setup
[06/12/2007 02:31:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is simple, he just to the conclusion that i couldn't hold on to documents
[06/12/2007 02:32:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't need to defend myself
[06/12/2007 02:32:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope you read the entire conversation
[06/12/2007 02:32:15 PM] Alex Markov: but all teams will alwyas have challanges and errors and issues to deal with. 
[06/12/2007 02:32:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, you're right alex
[06/12/2007 02:32:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: but this doesn't change anything
[06/12/2007 02:33:44 PM] Alex Markov: i did. bobby can be tense on occasion. he is wrong to assume that you should hang onto documenets. but you CANT not get so defensive! just say "Opps, i think i deleted it. let me double check." and then when u double check... jsut say "Yeah sorry, i deleted it. we wont have problems like this once we get SVN setup :). Lets see if Alex has a copy of it"
[06/12/2007 02:33:54 PM] Alex Markov: "Yeah sorry, i deleted it. we wont have problems like this once we get SVN setup  . Lets see if Alex has a copy of it"
[06/12/2007 02:34:06 PM] Alex Markov: that is so much better than
[06/12/2007 02:34:07 PM] Alex Markov: Brian Cullinan says: 
give me a minute and a please and i might check my email for you
[06/12/2007 02:36:01 PM] Alex Markov: do u understand?
[06/12/2007 02:36:31 PM] Alex Markov: how different wording is just much better?
[06/12/2007 02:36:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: this isn't the first time i've been accused by him
[06/12/2007 02:37:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: look, i am not going to defend myself, so there's really no point to continuing this conversation
[06/12/2007 02:37:08 PM] Alex Markov: we all accuse each other tho! shit will happen i promise you that. shit happens everywhere. but we cannot eat each other
[06/12/2007 02:37:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know we are a team and i know some of us have more problems then others
[06/12/2007 02:38:32 PM] Alex Markov: well here is a perfect example. say in the future, i forget to add a docuement into svn. and you ask me why i did not follow protocol. do you think i should respond in a calm tone or a defensive tone
[06/12/2007 02:38:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are plenty of things i could tell you to convince you that i am a victim
[06/12/2007 02:39:05 PM] Alex Markov: my point is dont feel like a victim. TRUST ME i get alot of shit from bobby. and i give him alot of shit back. 
[06/12/2007 02:39:12 PM] Alex Markov: but the tone of the discussion never turns sour
[06/12/2007 02:40:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: k but there is an exchange of shit
[06/12/2007 02:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats where the problem is
[06/12/2007 02:42:24 PM] Alex Markov: yes but this is a general fact of life, that we will capture more with honey rather than sour stuff
[06/12/2007 02:42:32 PM] Alex Markov: this is a lesson for all of us across the board. if a client is being very rude
[06/12/2007 02:42:43 PM] Alex Markov: we cannot be rude back. we just gotta learn to let it roll off our back
[06/12/2007 02:42:48 PM] Alex Markov: and just kinda joke it off
[06/12/2007 02:42:55 PM] Alex Markov: we cant be so sensitive
[06/12/2007 02:43:19 PM] Alex Markov: because who know why the client is being rude. his son may have just gotten into a car accident. or he could have just gotten itno a fight with his wife
[06/12/2007 02:43:40 PM] Alex Markov: humans are very sensitive creatures by nature. but sensitivity is not good for business or for anything really
[06/12/2007 02:44:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, why are you talking to me about this still?  did you read the responses?
[06/12/2007 02:44:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you read the entire conversation?
[06/12/2007 02:44:20 PM] Alex Markov: just handle everything with a little humor. like instead of letting bobby get to you
[06/12/2007 02:44:22 PM] Alex Markov: yes i read it
[06/12/2007 02:44:48 PM] Alex Markov: that is typical bobby. 
[06/12/2007 02:44:51 PM] Alex Markov: he doesnt mean it
[06/12/2007 02:44:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok you want me to whip out some quotes on you from robert?
[06/12/2007 02:44:57 PM] Alex Markov: no i see them
[06/12/2007 02:45:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok because clearly you want to keep talking about this
[06/12/2007 02:45:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i'm all in
[06/12/2007 02:45:26 PM] Alex Markov: my point is regardless of what i say to you, or robert says to you. or you say to me., we should enver take it to heart
[06/12/2007 02:45:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: "yeah, if you want to only be a programmer, you're on the right track"
[06/12/2007 02:45:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is that?
[06/12/2007 02:45:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty typical bobby?
[06/12/2007 02:45:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't think that is a comment i can work with
[06/12/2007 02:46:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: " in order to know to save a file, you've lost tons of files in the past"
[06/12/2007 02:46:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i am incredibly organized
[06/12/2007 02:46:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i deleted the file because it wasn't the final draft
[06/12/2007 02:46:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do i need to keep a file thats not a final draft on a project that hasn't been assigned to me?
[06/12/2007 02:47:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: now this is in specialist mode, as a specialist, i recieve the file when the project is started
[06/12/2007 02:47:29 PM] Alex Markov: you are right. but the problem why bobby is being somehwat snippy is u are snippy to him. its a vicious cycle that needs to stop
[06/12/2007 02:48:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: Cullinan:     seems as though i miss placed it  
 Robert Douglas:     you dont store it in a folder?  
 Brian Cullinan:     i would store it on an svn  
 Brian Cullinan:     but i delete documents if they are not organized properly  
 Robert Douglas:     you shouldnt *need* it to keep track of documents we send out
[06/12/2007 02:48:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: that last comment started it
[06/12/2007 02:48:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: not me
[06/12/2007 02:48:40 PM] Alex Markov: he said u shouldnt need SVN to keep track of documents
[06/12/2007 02:49:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: no he is telling me i should know how to keep track of documents
[06/12/2007 02:49:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: because he has sent me other frivolous things in the past
[06/12/2007 02:50:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so are we done?
[06/12/2007 02:50:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: we were both being aggressive
[06/12/2007 02:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not the one that didn't get remote desktop working before i left for another job
[06/12/2007 02:50:41 PM] Alex Markov: yes but it is sooooooo much better if you respond with something like "yeah, sucks, i deleted it. well when we get SVN this wont happen again" 
[06/12/2007 02:50:53 PM] Alex Markov: rahter than
[06/12/2007 02:50:53 PM] Alex Markov: Brian Cullinan says: 
ok how about you do what you need to, and i'll do what i need to
[06/12/2007 02:50:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not the one that has to keep track of PM documents, on a project i am not the PM for
[06/12/2007 02:51:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: he should do what he needs to
[06/12/2007 02:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you keep bring that up, you want me to take it back?
[06/12/2007 02:51:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is the PM for jambonie
[06/12/2007 02:51:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: NOT ME
[06/12/2007 02:51:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: he needs to keep track of documents
[06/12/2007 02:51:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: NOT ME
[06/12/2007 02:52:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i keep track of everything i need
[06/12/2007 02:52:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still have all my notes for meetings
[06/12/2007 02:52:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still have the list of corrections
[06/12/2007 02:52:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so are we done?
[06/12/2007 02:52:57 PM] Alex Markov: i agree. but regardless... we should all try to never be snippy. we cannot fight fire with fire
[06/12/2007 02:52:58 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/12/2007 02:53:07 PM] Alex Markov: keep in mind, fire against fire just causes more fire
[06/12/2007 02:53:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'll try not to be snippy, if he trys not to accuse me of being disorganized and being responsible for not having his documents
[06/12/2007 02:54:05 PM] Alex Markov: its still not good to respond with more accusations and fire
[06/12/2007 02:54:14 PM] Alex Markov: it is just pointless
[06/12/2007 02:54:15 PM] Alex Markov: agreed?
[06/12/2007 02:54:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/12/2007 02:55:05 PM] Alex Markov: k cool
[06/12/2007 02:55:13 PM] Alex Markov: brb package at the door i think
[06/12/2007 02:55:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i hope you have this conversation with robert as well

[06/15/2007 01:12:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: why can't he just leave him IM on like the rest of us that use a computer regularly
[06/15/2007 01:13:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about we use a new database software
[06/15/2007 01:13:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: pmxp kinda sucks
[06/15/2007 01:14:13 PM] Alex Markov: whih new databse software
[06/15/2007 01:14:21 PM] Alex Markov: me and robert were in a marketing meeting for a few hours today
[06/15/2007 01:16:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: why new database software?
[06/15/2007 01:16:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe because the one we have keeps coming up with glitches
[06/15/2007 01:16:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: its terrible to use
[06/15/2007 01:16:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and so is net drive
[06/15/2007 01:16:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know it downloads the temporary files off the server
[06/15/2007 01:16:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are never actually working with the active copy
[06/15/2007 01:16:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should have software that allows multiple logins at once
[06/15/2007 01:17:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: #  multiple concurrent users on the same file
 
[06/15/2007 01:17:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: not really being updated often but i did find software that would be a step up
[06/15/2007 01:18:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: moving away from netdrive is the most important
[06/15/2007 01:18:11 PM] Alex Markov: i think the permissions are set wrong for backupfolder
[06/15/2007 01:18:39 PM] Alex Markov: yes but we are money restricted
[06/15/2007 01:18:42 PM] Alex Markov: for more stuff
[06/15/2007 01:27:23 PM] Alex Markov: like when we were looking at password management things and thigns like netdrive
[06/15/2007 01:27:29 PM] Alex Markov: they require monthly user costs
[06/15/2007 01:27:33 PM] Alex Markov: are are expensive
[06/15/2007 01:27:40 PM] Alex Markov: and are expensive
[06/15/2007 01:27:48 PM] Alex Markov: right now it is free because we bought the sofgtware
[06/15/2007 01:27:52 PM] Alex Markov: no monthly costs

[06/20/2007 03:13:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: like?
[06/20/2007 03:13:28 PM] Alex Markov: 1. NYB discussion 
-checkout page 
-new pages 
-how to make product text standard 
-picture zoom option
[06/20/2007 03:13:38 PM] Alex Markov: can the checkout page be customized
[06/20/2007 03:13:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: depends on what you want to change
[06/20/2007 03:13:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can move stuff around i suppose

[06/20/2007 03:16:05 PM] Alex Markov: mainly... it would be nice to just have that payment details to be bold 
[06/20/2007 03:16:16 PM] Alex Markov: and to remove that additional information that says x-cart
[06/20/2007 03:16:19 PM] Alex Markov: that is really unprofessional
[06/20/2007 03:16:32 PM] Alex Markov: its so stupid that xcart included that

[06/20/2007 03:17:00 PM] Alex Markov: if u can put a little style on like that
[06/20/2007 03:17:02 PM] Alex Markov: do it
[06/20/2007 03:17:05 PM] Alex Markov: if not dont worry about it
[06/20/2007 03:17:13 PM] Alex Markov: but we need to remove that additional information part
[06/20/2007 03:18:21 PM] Alex Markov: ok?
[06/20/2007 03:18:33 PM] Alex Markov: i think we will pay u a little more than the $200 sinc eu doing more work on it
[06/20/2007 03:18:38 PM] Alex Markov: we'll work that out later
[06/20/2007 03:18:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know that seems like a lot of work
[06/20/2007 03:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am really busy with jambonie
[06/20/2007 03:19:02 PM] Alex Markov: dont bother adding style
[06/20/2007 03:19:10 PM] Alex Markov: just take out that additonal info that says this is an xcart store
[06/20/2007 03:19:19 PM] Alex Markov: its not 100% urgent
[06/20/2007 03:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i'll see what i can do
[06/20/2007 03:19:26 PM] Alex Markov: just put it on ur list
[06/20/2007 03:19:27 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/20/2007 03:19:40 PM] Alex Markov: next... to make new pages i jsut gotta get u the text right?
[06/20/2007 03:19:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: ye
[06/20/2007 03:20:02 PM] Alex Markov: ill try to get that within next week or two
[06/20/2007 03:20:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/20/2007 03:20:11 PM] Alex Markov: next... we need to come up with a way to make text standard
[06/20/2007 03:20:24 PM] Alex Markov: problem with internal xcart thing is it has nos pell check
[06/20/2007 03:20:29 PM] Alex Markov: that is why we been doing it in ms word
[06/20/2007 03:20:32 PM] Alex Markov: any ideas?
[06/20/2007 03:20:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: use firefox
[06/20/2007 03:20:42 PM] Alex Markov: maybe if we add products in FF we can use FF spell check
[06/20/2007 03:20:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: it has spell check
[06/20/2007 03:21:01 PM] Alex Markov: good point
[06/20/2007 03:21:02 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/20/2007 03:21:04 PM] Alex Markov: next
[06/20/2007 03:21:25 PM] Alex Markov: the ONLY picture zoom addon xcart has is this
[06/20/2007 03:21:26 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.x-cart.com/magnifier.html)http://www.x-cart.com/magnifier.html
[06/20/2007 03:21:30 PM] Alex Markov: but it uses a flash engine
[06/20/2007 03:21:36 PM] Alex Markov: thats no good because what if someone doesnt have flash
[06/20/2007 03:21:38 PM] Alex Markov: huge turnoff
[06/20/2007 03:21:48 PM] Alex Markov: client is willing to pay for this
[06/20/2007 03:21:58 PM] Alex Markov: do u think u can make an xcart zoom feature?
[06/20/2007 03:22:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do you need a picture zoom?
[06/20/2007 03:22:03 PM] Alex Markov: we can resell it afterwards
[06/20/2007 03:22:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do you need a picture zoom?

[06/20/2007 03:22:22 PM] Alex Markov: their biggest competitor has it
[06/20/2007 03:22:24 PM] Alex Markov: clients wants it
[06/20/2007 03:22:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats it?
[06/20/2007 03:22:44 PM] Alex Markov: and when products dont have enough height. the pictures look very small
[06/20/2007 03:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: all they did was put it in another window
[06/20/2007 03:23:02 PM] Alex Markov: because width wise they ened to be a certain size
[06/20/2007 03:23:20 PM] Alex Markov: yeah.we need something very simple
[06/20/2007 03:23:24 PM] Alex Markov: to enlarge a picture
[06/20/2007 03:23:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: can you upload multple pictures to a product now?
[06/20/2007 03:23:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: it just a thumbnail and regular size?
[06/20/2007 03:24:03 PM] Alex Markov: like we will upload the pictures in 400x400 size. they will show up in the product page in the 200x200 size. when they click on the 200 size it should openin new window as 400 size
[06/20/2007 03:24:44 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.nybeauty.com/beauty-supplies/andis-t-edger)http://www.nybeauty.com/beauty-supplies/andis-t-edger
[06/20/2007 03:24:59 PM] Alex Markov: that saving certificate needs to be moved down right next to the payment details
[06/20/2007 03:25:03 PM] Alex Markov: like to the right of the price
[06/20/2007 03:25:12 PM] Alex Markov: it is eating up valuable product page real estate
[06/20/2007 03:25:26 PM] Alex Markov: with that payment cert moved down we can make the picture width a bit wider
[06/20/2007 03:25:52 PM] Alex Markov: agreed?
[06/20/2007 03:26:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[06/20/2007 03:26:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats where it is by default
[06/20/2007 03:26:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks fine
[06/20/2007 03:27:02 PM] Alex Markov: it looks good there
[06/20/2007 03:27:07 PM] Alex Markov: but it is eating up space on the right
[06/20/2007 03:27:20 PM] Alex Markov: it is vetter if the image used more space
[06/20/2007 03:27:37 PM] Alex Markov: put it on your list to move it down... on the right of the price area
[06/20/2007 03:27:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, you're really going to have to make me a list of changes
[06/20/2007 03:28:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we need to renegotiate a price with the client
[06/20/2007 03:28:23 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[06/20/2007 03:28:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and someone needs to take responsibility for not getting any of the other pages designed when i recieved the template
[06/20/2007 03:28:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: implementing it is one thing, but you are asking me to completely change the way it works
[06/20/2007 03:29:00 PM] Alex Markov: no u are right
[06/20/2007 03:29:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that popup image is not going to be possible
[06/20/2007 03:29:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: xcart doesn't work like that, i can't just add whatever we want to it
[06/20/2007 03:29:27 PM] Alex Markov: ok i was just asking
[06/20/2007 03:29:48 PM] Alex Markov: client is willing to pay to add a zoom
[06/20/2007 03:30:01 PM] Alex Markov: the cert can stay there i guess
[06/20/2007 03:32:19 PM] Alex Markov: ok ill come up with a list of changes and will send to you. i will come up with 2 types of changes. final skin changes and changes to be quoted
[06/20/2007 03:32:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[06/20/2007 03:32:54 PM] Alex Markov: call it like skinning and finalizing
[06/20/2007 03:33:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the xhtml guy should do it
[06/20/2007 03:33:15 PM] Alex Markov: i am not fully aware about how xcart works
[06/20/2007 03:33:32 PM] Alex Markov: well then we need to figure out a way to specify it more clearly
[06/20/2007 03:36:19 PM] Alex Markov: eventually we will have a protocol for how to deal with xcart sites
[06/20/2007 03:36:29 PM] Alex Markov: sorry for the frustration bro :( it is not intentional

[06/22/2007 10:11:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: hi
[06/22/2007 10:12:08 AM] Alex Markov: u did not follow the status report protocol with the email subject
[06/22/2007 10:12:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: oops
[06/22/2007 10:12:42 AM] Alex Markov: follow the protocol. jsut open the email first thing in the morning. put the subject in. and write into it all day
[06/22/2007 10:12:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know i really don't care what everyone else did during their day
[06/22/2007 10:13:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i only care about the finished product being done when expected
[06/22/2007 10:13:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: how you get there, really doesn't matter
[06/22/2007 10:13:31 AM] Alex Markov: thats ok. we wstill need to do this
[06/22/2007 10:13:48 AM] Alex Markov: big companies do this. and when we pull in other people into the company we need to see what they do
[06/22/2007 10:14:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: but why does it send it to me?
[06/22/2007 10:14:13 AM] Alex Markov: it takes a little bit of time
[06/22/2007 10:14:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: it sends all the time sheets to everyone
[06/22/2007 10:14:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: that needs to stop
[06/22/2007 10:14:30 AM] Alex Markov: well if u would prefer it not send to u we can take u off the time@rp-s.com forward list
[06/22/2007 10:14:51 AM] Alex Markov: what i am gonna do is setupo a folder in outlook. and have it automatically place the emails with the SR subject into that folder
[06/22/2007 10:14:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: please do, if you want to keep these for records thats fine, but i really don't care what robert did all day
[06/22/2007 10:16:00 AM] Alex Markov: well... also i think we should know what we do. for example. say robert was working on something. and u read it and u have some insight or ideas on the topic. u can go and tell him about it
[06/22/2007 10:16:10 AM] Alex Markov: i think we will try this for a while where everyone gets it
[06/22/2007 10:17:04 AM] Alex Markov: u need to adapt and step up to a more managerial role. 
[06/22/2007 10:17:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: if its project related i should be able to look at the tasks in sugar and see his progress
[06/22/2007 10:17:38 AM] Alex Markov: yes but we do ALOT of things that are not project related during the days
[06/22/2007 10:17:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: if it is internal i should be able to see the progress in another area of sugar or in the forums
[06/22/2007 10:18:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: why implement this new more tedious system when we already have these tools in place?
[06/22/2007 10:18:42 AM] Alex Markov: eventually we will have the worklog send confirmation of status updates
[06/22/2007 10:18:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: sugar can keep track of everything
[06/22/2007 10:18:48 AM] Alex Markov: and that will replace this system
[06/22/2007 10:18:52 AM] Alex Markov: for now this is the way it is

[06/22/2007 05:50:09 PM] Alex Markov: somehting simple to start with
[06/22/2007 05:50:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: robocop is the shit
[06/22/2007 05:50:27 PM] Alex Markov: i think u were rly good in the meeting

[06/22/2007 06:18:59 PM] Alex Markov: this is a problem i have too but have gotten alot better over past few years
[06/22/2007 06:19:13 PM] Alex Markov: we need to respond to msn messages much quicker
[06/22/2007 06:19:21 PM] Alex Markov: and if we are gonna take a little bit to respond

[06/22/2007 06:19:53 PM] Alex Markov: i knwo sometimes we dont see the message flashing. this happens to me alot
[06/22/2007 06:20:06 PM] Alex Markov: but we just need to make more of an effort to make msn convos much more fluid
[06/22/2007 06:20:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/22/2007 06:21:14 PM] Alex Markov: like if u step away. or have a phone call. or go to the bathroom. we should make a very brief note so person knows 
[06/22/2007 06:21:22 PM] Alex Markov: i will try to be more diligent with that too
[06/22/2007 06:22:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: but sometimes when i step away for a minute i can just come back and read

[06/22/2007 06:46:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: Brian Cullinan: there was no deadline, so technically i e-mailed you back even if i waited until tomorrow when i knew for sure what was going on, it still would have been before the deadline that doesn't exist
[06/22/2007 06:49:53 PM] Alex Markov: yes but until we have deadlines just let bobby know when u gonna do it

[06/23/2007 12:09:30 PM] Alex Markov: u argue with him too much
[06/23/2007 12:10:06 PM] Alex Markov: and give him attitude. which i dont particularly like either. its not a friendly attitude sometimes. not productive at all
[06/23/2007 12:10:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but it goes both ways
[06/23/2007 12:10:37 PM] Alex Markov: i am not saying it doesnt
[06/23/2007 12:10:44 PM] Alex Markov: but u cant fight fire with more fire
[06/23/2007 12:10:50 PM] Alex Markov: that will justr cause a bigger fire
[06/23/2007 12:11:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: well we agreed to try and go a little easier on each other, with that and the protocol for providing deadlines i think things will move a lot smoother

[06/23/2007 03:17:53 PM] Alex Markov: yeah good idea
[06/23/2007 03:18:01 PM] Alex Markov: i wish making sugar tasks was easier
[06/23/2007 03:18:11 PM] Alex Markov: our sugar is so slow
[06/23/2007 03:18:18 PM] Alex Markov: we need to like put it on a dedicated server
[06/23/2007 03:18:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to write client software for this stuff
[06/23/2007 03:18:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would still go through sugar
[06/23/2007 03:18:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would upload the information into the database automatically
[06/23/2007 03:18:52 PM] Alex Markov: sugar has an offline version
[06/23/2007 03:19:00 PM] Alex Markov: but bobby was never aqble to get it to work
[06/23/2007 03:19:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: did he say why?
[06/23/2007 03:19:12 PM] Alex Markov: no
[06/23/2007 03:19:15 PM] Alex Markov: we had tickets open
[06/23/2007 03:19:19 PM] Alex Markov: it was like buggy
[06/23/2007 03:19:25 PM] Alex Markov: but that was like 5 sugar versions ago
[06/23/2007 03:19:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm

[06/23/2007 03:37:46 PM] Alex Markov: it would in theory be rly quick on the computer
[06/23/2007 03:37:54 PM] Alex Markov: and then jsut have it to sync every 5 minutes
[06/23/2007 03:42:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: how does it look?
[06/23/2007 03:42:54 PM] Alex Markov: Server and Client must both be running the same flavor of Sugar.

[06/25/2007 01:34:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:34:50 PM] Alex Markov: i think workflows can eventually take over worklog
[06/25/2007 01:34:56 PM] Alex Markov: or make worklog much easier
[06/25/2007 01:35:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah probably
[06/25/2007 01:35:06 PM] Alex Markov: like i would like to get emails when any task is done
[06/25/2007 01:35:13 PM] Alex Markov: and when an opportuntiy is upgraded to another stage
[06/25/2007 01:35:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: since they will eventually contain all the steps
[06/25/2007 01:35:31 PM] Alex Markov: i jut want a massive flow of emails all day
[06/25/2007 01:35:42 PM] Alex Markov: i am gonna forward them to a specific outlook folder
[06/25/2007 01:35:49 PM] Alex Markov: so they wont come into my inbox but just a folder
[06/25/2007 01:36:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah good idea
[06/25/2007 01:36:03 PM] Alex Markov: which i will check several times a day and keep a record of what is done when

[06/25/2007 01:37:14 PM] Alex Markov: togehter
[06/25/2007 01:37:25 PM] Alex Markov: PM and HPM meet 
-go over the research 
-formulate a gameplan and meeting agenda for the consultation meeting 

[06/25/2007 01:37:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah exactly
[06/25/2007 01:38:04 PM] Alex Markov: then they meet. and the PM schedules a meeting for himself to prepare
[06/25/2007 01:38:14 PM] Alex Markov: so stage 2 of opp will have 2 meetings
[06/25/2007 01:38:29 PM] Alex Markov: 3 meetings actually
[06/25/2007 01:38:35 PM] Alex Markov: research. hpm meeting. preparation
[06/25/2007 01:38:43 PM] Alex Markov: ok thats what i invision
[06/25/2007 01:39:03 PM] Alex Markov: and basically... i want all days to be organized like time blocks
[06/25/2007 01:39:08 PM] Alex Markov: for weeks in advance
[06/25/2007 01:40:02 PM] Alex Markov: so for example. as soon as a pm initiates the opp. he should schedule a time in his schedule to research. 1 hour. and then right away a time to meet with the hpm 1 hour and then 2 hours of prep
[06/25/2007 01:40:19 PM] Alex Markov: so stage 2 of an opp should take no mroe than 4 hours. and eventually we will try to bring that down to like 2 hours
[06/25/2007 01:40:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:40:36 PM] Alex Markov: since the preparation time will decrease with more materials
[06/25/2007 01:41:14 PM] Alex Markov: this is gonna be a looonnngggg and tedious process to get everything workflowed correctly. its jksut like programming tho
[06/25/2007 01:41:17 PM] Alex Markov: jsut like html
[06/25/2007 01:41:24 PM] Alex Markov: only it will organize ALL company operations
[06/25/2007 01:41:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:41:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: to set them up i just need the protocol
[06/25/2007 01:41:51 PM] Alex Markov: ok so what do we need to setup the workflows. we are rdy right?
[06/25/2007 01:42:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we still need to fix the HPM1/3
[06/25/2007 01:42:09 PM] Alex Markov: i think i wanna setup a chunk of them to learn it
[06/25/2007 01:42:11 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/25/2007 01:42:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can set them up, just look at what i have done so far and you will catch on
[06/25/2007 01:42:34 PM] Alex Markov: i say we all go over each protocol with the workflows in mind and make notes on what workflows that neds to be created
[06/25/2007 01:42:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: want to see a bangin hot chick?
[06/25/2007 01:42:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://data5.teendreams.com/tour.php?go=pic&model=3992&set=6793&item=0001.jpg)http://data5.teendreams.com/tour.php?go=pic&model=3992&set=6793&item=0001.jpg

[06/25/2007 01:42:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:43:05 PM] Alex Markov: where we go through each one and take notes on whayt workflow we need to make for each step
[06/25/2007 01:43:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:43:15 PM] Alex Markov: and then we will go in and from the ntoes make the flowflows
[06/25/2007 01:43:19 PM] Alex Markov: flowflows lol
[06/25/2007 01:43:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: workflows

[06/25/2007 01:44:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: leads should be pretty much done
[06/25/2007 01:44:14 PM] Alex Markov: we need to meet and go over each protocol and discuss it
[06/25/2007 01:44:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe some more customizing of the e-mails
[06/25/2007 01:44:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but they look pretty good
[06/25/2007 01:44:26 PM] Alex Markov: so we ened to set a meeting
[06/25/2007 01:44:32 PM] Alex Markov: i will discuss with bobby and we will set ASAP
[06/25/2007 01:44:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok lets make out just for those protocols then

[06/25/2007 01:45:34 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[06/25/2007 01:45:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we need to include robert in the rest of that discussion so he knows what we are doing with workflows
[06/25/2007 01:45:59 PM] Alex Markov: yes we need to make a emeting for that. i put on my list and will talk to robert and discuss his avaialbility
[06/25/2007 01:46:09 PM] Alex Markov: ok

[06/25/2007 01:46:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/25/2007 01:46:43 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://rp-s.com/new-site/concept.html)http://rp-s.com/new-site/concept.html
[06/25/2007 01:46:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so robert said thats all we were waiting on
[06/25/2007 01:46:46 PM] Alex Markov: that is our PSD
[06/25/2007 01:47:05 PM] Alex Markov: open them side by side
[06/25/2007 01:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty close
[06/25/2007 01:47:30 PM] Alex Markov: lets see what is off
[06/25/2007 01:47:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: a little coloring
[06/25/2007 01:47:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: login area coloring
[06/25/2007 01:47:53 PM] Alex Markov: ok im gonna make a list as we go along
[06/25/2007 01:48:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: did he say he was finished?
[06/25/2007 01:48:15 PM] Alex Markov: he sent in for changes
[06/25/2007 01:48:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok heres another thing
 take some of the padding or margin off the left and right boxes
[06/25/2007 01:49:25 PM] Alex Markov: goodcall
[06/25/2007 01:50:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but other then that there are a few font differences
[06/25/2007 01:50:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: one more important thing
 tell him we want Services to be an image, we don't need it to be text and thats the only place that banner is used
[06/25/2007 01:51:20 PM] Alex Markov: well we have a whole navigation done that we paid $175 for a while back
[06/25/2007 01:51:22 PM] Alex Markov: its slick
[06/25/2007 01:51:31 PM] Alex Markov: thats one fo the changes that we need to send him the navigation code we made
[06/25/2007 01:51:47 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://new-site.rp-s.com/)http://new-site.rp-s.com/
[06/25/2007 01:51:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: finally
 the top buttons are all red, as long as he makes the white ones available as well as the button images under "Why RPS"
[06/25/2007 01:51:56 PM] Alex Markov: we gonna make it look like the nav in the templatre tho
[06/25/2007 01:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: other then that i don't see anything else, it looks great
[06/25/2007 01:53:05 PM] Alex Markov: uyep
[06/25/2007 01:53:08 PM] Alex Markov: we gonna have a sexy site :)
[06/25/2007 01:53:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe just tell him the default font collor should be about #666666
[06/25/2007 01:53:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: that will make a big difference
[06/25/2007 01:53:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a cold fuckin shower after looking at that chick
[06/25/2007 01:54:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am downloading over 8500 sets of pictures of women

[06/25/2007 01:55:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes you do
[06/25/2007 01:55:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so is that good for the rps template
[06/25/2007 01:55:31 PM] Alex Markov: yes\moving on
[06/25/2007 01:55:33 PM] Alex Markov: nyb
[06/25/2007 01:55:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: might want to wait on robert to comment on it
[06/25/2007 01:55:36 PM] Alex Markov: u get the chages i sent over
[06/25/2007 01:55:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i will work on those changes today
[06/25/2007 01:55:46 PM] Alex Markov: i am sending those changes to robert to finalize and to send to ryan
[06/25/2007 01:55:53 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/25/2007 01:55:57 PM] Alex Markov: dont forget to keep a detailed log
[06/25/2007 01:56:00 PM] Alex Markov: i am keeping one
[06/25/2007 01:56:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: will do
[06/25/2007 01:57:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so SVN
[06/25/2007 01:57:12 PM] Alex Markov: svn
[06/25/2007 01:57:15 PM] Alex Markov: whats going on
[06/25/2007 01:57:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can start working on that today if you like
[06/25/2007 01:57:28 PM] Alex Markov: yes 
[06/25/2007 01:57:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will start implementing our filesystem that we discussed
[06/25/2007 01:57:34 PM] Alex Markov: make it high priority
[06/25/2007 01:57:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: shouldn't take me very long
[06/25/2007 01:57:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but getting our documents together will take a while
[06/25/2007 01:57:57 PM] Alex Markov: i am gonna finish all accoutnign shit
[06/25/2007 01:57:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: everyone will have to participate in that
[06/25/2007 01:58:04 PM] Alex Markov: once accoutnign is finished. svn. and rps site
[06/25/2007 01:58:07 PM] Alex Markov: we are full setup
[06/25/2007 01:58:23 PM] Alex Markov: like we are setup in terms ofour company structure
[06/25/2007 01:58:26 PM] Alex Markov: then we build on it
[06/25/2007 01:58:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, then we can discuss giving out passwords to employees, which will be dynamic, so add SVN discussion to the next meeting
[06/25/2007 01:59:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should find a cool way to make a project for it in sugar so that in the future when we have filesystem changes to it, we can send out e-mails to everyone that uses each section
[06/25/2007 01:59:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be cool
[06/25/2007 02:00:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: so thats my list, NYB fixes, and SVN setup
[06/25/2007 02:00:12 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/25/2007 02:00:28 PM] Alex Markov: we have a project for svn
[06/25/2007 02:00:28 PM] Alex Markov: rSVN
[06/25/2007 02:01:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok cool i will look into the capabilities of sugar some more
[06/25/2007 02:01:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you have a girlfriend?

[06/25/2007 02:25:03 PM] Alex Markov: lol wow
[06/25/2007 02:25:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its the perfect business plan

[06/25/2007 02:25:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got like a 1 month trial, and just crawled the entire site
[06/25/2007 02:25:30 PM] Alex Markov: how did u rip all those from metart
[06/25/2007 02:25:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: a crawler
[06/25/2007 02:25:40 PM] Alex Markov: wow
[06/25/2007 02:25:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: it downloads every zip file
[06/25/2007 02:25:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i had to do was specify some limitations
[06/25/2007 02:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: they make it too easy
[06/25/2007 02:26:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: javascript links can't be crawled
[06/25/2007 02:26:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: noobs
[06/25/2007 02:26:35 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[06/25/2007 02:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i ever make a website that is sensitive like that i am using javascript links
[06/25/2007 02:29:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: then google won't be able to list my content
[06/25/2007 02:29:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will be unsuable

[06/25/2007 02:32:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: C4 is an explosive
[06/25/2007 02:32:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if it is cell phone activated
[06/25/2007 02:32:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i get my one phone call
[06/25/2007 02:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: bye bye evidence

[06/25/2007 02:34:27 PM] Alex Markov: what is the most of ur worries
[06/25/2007 02:34:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm DVDs and software
[06/25/2007 02:37:07 PM] Alex Markov: bah. spend more time working on rps and less time organizing dvds and pictures that u will never have enough time to watch anyway
[06/25/2007 02:37:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the beauty of it, i spend relative NO time organizing anything
[06/25/2007 02:38:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i ran a script on the downloaded pictures and it organized everything
[06/25/2007 02:39:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: Data Mining 101
[06/25/2007 02:44:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should really take some CS courses
[06/25/2007 02:44:45 PM] Alex Markov: ehh. probably a decent idea. but i dont have time for it and i hate classes
[06/25/2007 02:45:09 PM] Alex Markov: furthermore.. i have tried programming before. and i am simply not a programmer breed
[06/25/2007 02:45:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: well suit yourself, i don't have any problem explaining the tech-details when we come across something
[06/25/2007 02:46:07 PM] Alex Markov: i am more business oriented
[06/25/2007 02:46:17 PM] Alex Markov: eventually i will step away and not even work on projects
[06/25/2007 02:47:18 PM] Alex Markov: i will just negotiate with our vendors. oversee expansion plans
[06/25/2007 02:47:25 PM] Alex Markov: work with deparment heads
[06/25/2007 02:47:27 PM] Alex Markov: make decisions

[06/25/2007 02:50:01 PM] Alex Markov: i just plan strategies. and will negotiate things all day
[06/25/2007 02:50:10 PM] Alex Markov: like once we get some real nice volume going for printing and other things
[06/25/2007 02:50:19 PM] Alex Markov: i will go meet with executives at those companies and get us better prices

[06/25/2007 05:44:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the only thing i make reference to
[06/25/2007 05:44:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: the popup image thing i explain in full, so you should know what i am refering to

[06/26/2007 09:20:11 AM] Alex Markov: hi
[06/26/2007 11:37:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: hi
[06/26/2007 11:37:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: back from class
[06/26/2007 11:40:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: get my e-mail?
[06/26/2007 11:43:53 AM] Alex Markov: hey
[06/26/2007 11:43:53 AM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/26/2007 11:44:00 AM] Alex Markov: we need to talk about a few things
[06/26/2007 11:44:14 AM] Alex Markov: let me know when u are rdy
[06/26/2007 11:44:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am ready
[06/26/2007 11:44:35 AM] Alex Markov: ok. 
[06/26/2007 11:45:23 AM] Alex Markov: 1. i researched the dispute u and robert had last night
[06/26/2007 11:45:46 AM] Alex Markov: i am gonna give an unbiased opinion on the issue
[06/26/2007 11:46:03 AM] Alex Markov: and hear out everything i need to say before jumping to conclusions
[06/26/2007 11:46:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/26/2007 11:46:18 AM] Alex Markov: i believe u broke protocol and did not continue to check emails.
[06/26/2007 11:46:24 AM] Alex Markov: now i do see your point that it was dinner time
[06/26/2007 11:46:35 AM] Alex Markov: and that at a cetain time u should not be responsible to do so
[06/26/2007 11:46:56 AM] Alex Markov: i will commend you on the fgact that during the disute u remained calm and logical
[06/26/2007 11:47:02 AM] Alex Markov: which was very nice
[06/26/2007 11:47:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i try
[06/26/2007 11:47:18 AM] Alex Markov: however... the last email was sent at like 6pm
[06/26/2007 11:47:24 AM] Alex Markov: if u start work at 1pm
[06/26/2007 11:47:30 AM] Alex Markov: that is only 5 hours into the day
[06/26/2007 11:47:43 AM] Alex Markov: so in theory... even if u are on a lose clock
[06/26/2007 11:47:47 AM] Alex Markov: loose
[06/26/2007 11:47:58 AM] Alex Markov: that last email should have been checked and responded too
[06/26/2007 11:48:32 AM] Alex Markov: in addition... i think emails should be checked after the end of work. and responded too. if humanly possible. after the end of work. mainly because our firm is different that others
[06/26/2007 11:48:38 AM] Alex Markov: we work on a global time schedule
[06/26/2007 11:48:41 AM] Alex Markov: ryan is in new zealand
[06/26/2007 11:48:51 AM] Alex Markov: we work on 2 timezones in america
[06/26/2007 11:49:00 AM] Alex Markov: our tempaltes are done in ukraine
[06/26/2007 11:49:07 AM] Alex Markov: we work with indians from time to time
[06/26/2007 11:49:34 AM] Alex Markov: so although we are not obligated to respond to emails after a full workday... it is good if we do
[06/26/2007 11:49:35 AM] Alex Markov: agreed?
[06/26/2007 11:49:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/26/2007 11:49:55 AM] Alex Markov: furthermore.... i want to say that we do appreciette the work u have been doing and ur involvement in rps
[06/26/2007 11:50:26 AM] Alex Markov: and i strongly beleive that if we can have a succesful business relationship
[06/26/2007 11:50:34 AM] Alex Markov: and i think disputes and disagreements are beneficial
[06/26/2007 11:50:45 AM] Alex Markov: because it just means our policies need to be amended
[06/26/2007 11:51:48 AM] Alex Markov: in this specific case... u should have checked and responded to that last email. because u were only working for like 5 hours. due to your class obligation... it puts some strain on our schedule. but we all have obligations sometimes. like u and bobby are gonna be in class this fall
[06/26/2007 11:52:00 AM] Alex Markov: we will need to work around that
[06/26/2007 11:52:35 AM] Alex Markov: in response to the dispute last night. we are going to be making a new feature in rps
[06/26/2007 11:52:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/26/2007 11:52:40 AM] Alex Markov: a dispute resolution forum
[06/26/2007 11:52:46 AM] Alex Markov: argueing back and forth is often a waste of time and pointless
[06/26/2007 11:53:05 AM] Alex Markov: so issues that are in conflict will be submitted to the new forum under the HR department
[06/26/2007 11:53:12 AM] Alex Markov: and then looked at by all managers
[06/26/2007 11:53:19 AM] Alex Markov: currently in this case i would have looked at it
[06/26/2007 11:54:02 AM] Alex Markov: one thing robert told me he feels you should try harder to do is sometimes just say "oh... my bad i did not do that"
[06/26/2007 11:54:08 AM] Alex Markov: rather than argueing and trying to jsutify it
[06/26/2007 11:54:39 AM] Alex Markov: and this is a general life lesson for all of us. that it is better to jsut say "opps. sorry i did not follow the protocol exactly, ill try to do so in the future"
[06/26/2007 11:54:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have no problem admitting when i am wrong, but in this case i truly don't believe i was in the wrong
[06/26/2007 11:55:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i admit to being wrong all the time, probably more then most men
[06/26/2007 11:55:21 AM] Alex Markov: but u did not respond to an email that was sent 5 hours into ur workday. 
[06/26/2007 11:55:58 AM] Alex Markov: if u say that after a certain point in a day... u should not be required to be considered as working... do u think 5 hours is enough if u are working a quasi full time schedule?
[06/26/2007 11:56:12 AM] Alex Markov: like after a certain point... i should not be required to answer phone calls
[06/26/2007 11:56:18 AM] Alex Markov: like after like 5 6pm my time
[06/26/2007 11:56:23 AM] Alex Markov: but i dont start the day at 1pm
[06/26/2007 11:56:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes but i did respond to the other 4 e-mails he sent me, and the last one i sent to him i responded in detail to the questions he had and explained the status entirely, that was kind of the closure e-mail to me
[06/26/2007 11:57:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have a problem working irregular hours, thats not what the problem is here
[06/26/2007 11:57:17 AM] Alex Markov: but aparently u did not make the closure as evident because robert did not see it as the closure email
[06/26/2007 11:57:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: lets break this down to step by step and we can figure out where it when wrong
[06/26/2007 11:57:30 AM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/26/2007 11:57:52 AM] Alex Markov: Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2007 18:35:13 -0700 
 
Why not use fake PayPal funds so you dont have to wait 4 days to verify it 
all? 

[06/26/2007 11:58:01 AM] Alex Markov: that was the email bobby sent u at 5:35
[06/26/2007 11:58:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: he sent me an e-mail with a change that needed to be made and set a reasonable deadline
[06/26/2007 11:58:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes but, i explained that issue in the e-mail before it
[06/26/2007 11:58:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: and even if i do answer that question, it doesn't change the progress of the task, because there is nothing more i can do
[06/26/2007 11:58:52 AM] Alex Markov: regardless.... if there was a followup email. even if the question was moot and stupid and compltely pointless
[06/26/2007 11:58:59 AM] Alex Markov: there should be a reply email
[06/26/2007 11:59:20 AM] Alex Markov: if i send u an email and i ask a rely dumb question
[06/26/2007 11:59:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: so he sent me the request for the change, i researched it and sent him a status update, we are good up to this point
[06/26/2007 11:59:25 AM] Alex Markov: i should get a response
[06/26/2007 11:59:40 AM] Alex Markov: 1. its common curtiousty... and 2. it helps clearup misunderstandings
[06/26/2007 12:01:38 PM] Alex Markov: the bottom line as i see it... is this email should have gotten a response
[06/26/2007 12:01:39 PM] Alex Markov: Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2007 18:35:13 -0700 
 
Why not use fake PayPal funds so you dont have to wait 4 days to verify it 
all? 

[06/26/2007 12:01:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes but by the time he sent that e-mail i had expressed that the test was going to extend passed the deadline, that is where i turn off that task, and work on other things while i wait, see its not the WHEN i respond to e-mails that is a problem, if i had gone to bed and waited until tomorrow entirely and not spoken to him the rest of the night, he would have assumed i was not around and couldn't respond
[06/26/2007 12:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: its the simple fact that i decided to work on something else while waiting on paypal that set him off
[06/26/2007 12:02:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and no matter what i do between now and when the test is completed, the status of the task will not change
[06/26/2007 12:02:56 PM] Alex Markov: well it was the fact that u left the issue unclosed in a general scope. u felt it was closed but it was not because there was an outstanding email inquiry
[06/26/2007 12:03:12 PM] Alex Markov: then u should make that more clear in a response to the email
[06/26/2007 12:04:19 PM] Alex Markov: in this email
[06/26/2007 12:04:19 PM] Alex Markov: Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2007 18:35:13 -0700 
 
Why not use fake PayPal funds so you dont have to wait 4 days to verify it 
all? 

[06/26/2007 12:04:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: then maybe we had a misunderstanding of what the closing e-mail was. there is a bigger problem here then just not responding.  if i respond then he responds to that, and i respond again, and he responds again, there is an endless cycle
[06/26/2007 12:04:36 PM] Alex Markov: bobby proposed a different method which could possibly speed up the task
[06/26/2007 12:05:05 PM] Alex Markov: a proposal of different beneficial method is good. 
[06/26/2007 12:05:20 PM] Alex Markov: if the task can close in one day rather than 3-4. that is a good thing
[06/26/2007 12:05:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so five minutes after i finally responded to that e-mail, he sent me another one, when does it end?
[06/26/2007 12:05:43 PM] Alex Markov: it ends when the task is compelte and the best methods to complete the task are figured out
[06/26/2007 12:05:53 PM] Alex Markov: that is the same for all things
[06/26/2007 12:06:06 PM] Alex Markov: its not an endless cycle
[06/26/2007 12:06:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: well between not and until the task completes it is endless
[06/26/2007 12:06:48 PM] Alex Markov: endless means having no end. the completion of the task is the end
[06/26/2007 12:06:51 PM] Alex Markov: its not endless bro
[06/26/2007 12:07:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: he could send me an infinite amount of e-mails and no matter how many times i respond the status of the task isn't going to change
[06/26/2007 12:07:24 PM] Alex Markov: i mean we are all here to build a strong client base so this company succeeds. it was not bobby's intention to cause frustration and send unneeded emails
[06/26/2007 12:07:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know that
[06/26/2007 12:07:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats definitely not the issue here
[06/26/2007 12:08:01 PM] Alex Markov: yes but if someone proposes a different method to something... even if the different method is wrong. that proposal MUST be addressed
[06/26/2007 12:08:03 PM] Alex Markov: am i wrong?
[06/26/2007 12:08:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[06/26/2007 12:08:18 PM] Alex Markov: why do u think not?
[06/26/2007 12:08:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i had already told him that wouldn't work, but that doesn't matter either, what matters is no matter how many e-mails i send him the status of the task isn't going to change
[06/26/2007 12:09:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i told him that, i told him there was no way to run a faster test because no money transfer was instant
[06/26/2007 12:09:58 PM] Alex Markov: if u explained to him why that wouldnt work before... and he sent an email with the same question... then you did not explain it well enough and should reexplain. that is the nature of conversation in general. that if a point is not udnerstood by all parties. then it should be readdressed
[06/26/2007 12:10:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so should i instead sit around waiting for something that i don't have any control over to happen?  simply because he decided this task has the highest priority
[06/26/2007 12:10:22 PM] Alex Markov: np
[06/26/2007 12:10:23 PM] Alex Markov: no
[06/26/2007 12:10:33 PM] Alex Markov: but we should never leave a task in status limbo
[06/26/2007 12:10:42 PM] Alex Markov: u thought the task was closed for the day
[06/26/2007 12:10:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/26/2007 12:10:53 PM] Alex Markov: because bobby sent that email... obviously he did not think so
[06/26/2007 12:11:30 PM] Alex Markov: because he reopened it. u should have changed it in your mind from closed to "open until reexplained"
[06/26/2007 12:12:26 PM] Alex Markov: i mean this is a fundamental thing that should be done across the board
[06/26/2007 12:12:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so i finally did respond to that e-mail and again i got another reply from him, this is why i consider it an endless loop until the task is completed
[06/26/2007 12:13:19 PM] Alex Markov: but the problem is... u cannot make assumptions like that without telling anyone. u responded 4 hours later when he asked u about it
[06/26/2007 12:13:53 PM] Alex Markov: and u responded talking about bank account and not about paypal
[06/26/2007 12:14:01 PM] Alex Markov: so there was a misunderstanding
[06/26/2007 12:14:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes there was, and for me, because there was no other work that i could do on that project, i closed my e-mail and stopped working on it
[06/26/2007 12:14:48 PM] Alex Markov: Robert, 
 
You are the one that requested this last test.  And you should have assumed 
that when I said I was waiting 3 to 4 days for paypal that this test was not 
going to be completed by the deadline that you decided, not discussed. 
Finally, I know the script works, I am waiting a test that is only taking 
place because you kept insisting on it. There are no funds in the fake 
paypal account.  I wou
[06/26/2007 12:14:55 PM] Alex Markov: this is the end to the loop
[06/26/2007 12:15:00 PM] Alex Markov: that should have come at 6pm
[06/26/2007 12:15:05 PM] Alex Markov: not 5 hours later
[06/26/2007 12:15:09 PM] Alex Markov: do u see my point tho
[06/26/2007 12:15:17 PM] Alex Markov: that even tho u might be right. u cannot leave a loop open
[06/26/2007 12:15:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see your point that i missed his e-mail earlier
[06/26/2007 12:15:24 PM] Alex Markov: none of us can
[06/26/2007 12:15:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought i has summed up the status pretty well in the one i sent before that, but i was wrong, he still had more questions
[06/26/2007 12:16:15 PM] Alex Markov: well that is the thing. bobby pointed out that u missed the email. and he explaiend that due to the new policies that we should check the emails frequently... especially during on the clock type hours
[06/26/2007 12:16:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't check my e-mail often enough i guess
[06/26/2007 12:17:18 PM] Alex Markov: and u continued to argue and explain that u werenot on the clock and the issue was an endless loop. however the email was sent 5 hours into your workday... which is not unreasonable 
[06/26/2007 12:17:34 PM] Alex Markov: and it was not an endless loop becuse the email u sent last closed the loop
[06/26/2007 12:17:59 PM] Alex Markov: by you sending 2 more quick emails u would have clarified it for everyone and not caused frustration
[06/26/2007 12:18:12 PM] Alex Markov: do u understand my point?
[06/26/2007 12:18:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're right if i had my e-mail open i should be expected to respond, but thats not how i function, i need time during the day to just work, and not be expected to answer everyone immediately, and if that is not good enough then we can't work together
[06/26/2007 12:18:42 PM] Alex Markov: why cant u set outlook to send and receive every 1 minute like my and bobby have it so that when an email comes u automatically get notifed of it
[06/26/2007 12:19:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i closed my e-mail because i am having trouble with another account so it pops up the login dialog every 5 minutes
[06/26/2007 12:19:19 PM] Alex Markov: i disagree. i think outlook should be opened all day
[06/26/2007 12:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i didn't open it again until robert complained to me
[06/26/2007 12:19:33 PM] Alex Markov: so set that one to not run send anr eceive automatically
[06/26/2007 12:19:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the only reason he complained to me is because i was working on other stuff
[06/26/2007 12:20:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so, my mistake, i worked on other stuff
[06/26/2007 12:20:12 PM] Alex Markov: he complaiend because that email was not responded to because it was clearly send during normal business hours
[06/26/2007 12:20:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: next time if outlook is not open, i will not work, and vice versa
[06/26/2007 12:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think this e-mail issue has gotten way the fuck out of hand, and personally i can't stand it any more
[06/26/2007 12:21:08 PM] Alex Markov: no. outlook should be opened all day. i am making that a new policy
[06/26/2007 12:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is rapidly becoming not worth it for me to sit here being bitched at because i didn't respond to an e-mail
[06/26/2007 12:21:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have a lot bigger problems then responding to an e-mail
[06/26/2007 12:22:04 PM] Alex Markov: brian. it is unreasonable for u to get upset when i think emails should be checked all day. most people i know check emails all day. i sometimes have back and forht emails with ryan and other people we work with
[06/26/2007 12:22:18 PM] Alex Markov: lines of communication must be open all day
[06/26/2007 12:22:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what IM is for
[06/26/2007 12:22:39 PM] Alex Markov: all lines
[06/26/2007 12:22:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: if he really wanted a response he could have asked "did you get my e-mail?" just like i asked you today
[06/26/2007 12:22:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i would have checked and responded
[06/26/2007 12:23:08 PM] Alex Markov: but how hard is it to keep outlook open all day?
[06/26/2007 12:23:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but no, he said "why are you working on svn when you have an outstanding e-mail"
[06/26/2007 12:23:17 PM] Alex Markov: it is not an unreasonable request
[06/26/2007 12:23:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i fucking chose to work on svn, that is why
[06/26/2007 12:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: no that is a smart ass comment
[06/26/2007 12:23:49 PM] Alex Markov: i dont think so. he wanted to know why there was an outstanding email
[06/26/2007 12:23:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: questioning why i am doing other work, instead of updating him every 5 minutes
[06/26/2007 12:24:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the important thing is, i was working
[06/26/2007 12:24:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: there weren't any e-mails about the SVN so i did not bother to check
[06/26/2007 12:24:29 PM] Alex Markov: i could be working all day. but if i am not returning emails or phone calls. even ONE. that is not ok
[06/26/2007 12:25:09 PM] Alex Markov: i think the misunderstanding is me and bobby want everyone to have outlook open all day. 
[06/26/2007 12:25:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will definitely return phone calls and reply to e-mails, but i need time to work on other stuff, not write e-mails all day
[06/26/2007 12:25:26 PM] Alex Markov: and u were not made clear of that. and it is my fault
[06/26/2007 12:25:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my opinion is, i should not have to have outlook open all day for working on something to be acceptable
[06/26/2007 12:25:50 PM] Alex Markov: it would have taken less than 1 minute to make those final responses to clsoe that loop. that is not all day
[06/26/2007 12:26:06 PM] Brian Cullinan:  i should not have to have outlook open all day in order to work
[06/26/2007 12:26:18 PM] Alex Markov: in my opinion i think every decision maker and everyone important should have email open all day
[06/26/2007 12:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and FYI that didn't close the loop because he sent me yet another e-mail after that
[06/26/2007 12:26:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no closing the loop, and therefore i can't be expected to repsond to e-mails all the time
[06/26/2007 12:27:08 PM] Alex Markov: loops should be resolved no matter the length or what needs to be done. 
[06/26/2007 12:27:34 PM] Alex Markov: brian that is an unreasonable request to be except from checking ur emails all day. 
[06/26/2007 12:27:45 PM] Alex Markov: is it that big of an inconvenience?
[06/26/2007 12:28:00 PM] Alex Markov: how different is it than IM
[06/26/2007 12:28:03 PM] Alex Markov: that is open all day
[06/26/2007 12:28:08 PM] Alex Markov: or a phone that is on all day
[06/26/2007 12:28:18 PM] Alex Markov: i sometimes respond to emails at night
[06/26/2007 12:28:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, and i am telling you that when i do not respond to and e-mail because i am working on something else, i should not be criticized for it
[06/26/2007 12:28:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if that is not possible, then i am done
[06/26/2007 12:28:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is not worth it for me to listen to you two bitch at me because i didn't respond to an e-mail because i was working on something ese
[06/26/2007 12:29:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is entirely selfish to think that i live and breath just waiting for your e-mails
[06/26/2007 12:29:41 PM] Alex Markov: u are taking it completely the wrong way
[06/26/2007 12:29:45 PM] Alex Markov: we are not bitching
[06/26/2007 12:29:51 PM] Alex Markov: we are simply discussing
[06/26/2007 12:30:02 PM] Alex Markov: we are discussing a proposed breakdown in comunication
[06/26/2007 12:30:05 PM] Alex Markov: u have one view point
[06/26/2007 12:30:06 PM] Alex Markov: i have another
[06/26/2007 12:30:25 PM] Alex Markov: it is GOOD that we discuss issues
[06/26/2007 12:30:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only thing i can promise is that i will get back to you if you call me, and or e-mail me within a reasonable amount of time
[06/26/2007 12:30:48 PM] Alex Markov: it is GOOD that resolutions are made to proposed issues. 
[06/26/2007 12:31:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my opinion of a reasonable amount of time concerning that issue, was the next day
[06/26/2007 12:31:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you had called me last night i probably would have answered, but if you had tried to schedule a meeting i would have said it needed to wait
[06/26/2007 12:32:49 PM] Alex Markov: see i disagree. if a client emails me. and i am physically capable of answering it. i SHOULD respond right away. we are trying to build a well oiled smooth running machine
[06/26/2007 12:32:58 PM] Alex Markov: do u not agree?
[06/26/2007 12:33:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: asking me about an e-mail would have been fine with me, but asking me why i was working on something else, was not ok with me
[06/26/2007 12:33:32 PM] Alex Markov: fine the method robert took to go about it may not have been correct.
[06/26/2007 12:33:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: this machine would run a lot smoother if work just got done
[06/26/2007 12:34:04 PM] Alex Markov: but we are not a simply working mahcine. we are a management machine. and management requires smooth and fluid lines of communication to be open
[06/26/2007 12:34:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have no problem updating him on the status of a task whenever he asks, my problem is that he tells me what i should and shouldn't be working on and when i should and shouldn't be doing it
[06/26/2007 12:34:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: either way the work has to get done
[06/26/2007 12:35:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats what i was doing, is getting stuff done, until he spent a half and hour arguing with me over not answering his e-mail
[06/26/2007 12:36:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: he could have just as easily said, "reply to my e-mail" and i would have done so, or he could have asked me his question over IM if it wasn't clear, but he told me to work on something that i told him earlier had to wait
[06/26/2007 12:36:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats where you and he differ, and why we get along better
[06/26/2007 12:37:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and because he mentioned e-mail last night, i did get back to the e-mails that i got, and it was all fine
[06/26/2007 12:37:46 PM] Alex Markov: ok. but as a manager. u need to have thicker skin and not be bothered by the method people take. 
[06/26/2007 12:38:06 PM] Alex Markov: if u did not like his method of questioning... then u should calming explain that
[06/26/2007 12:38:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats probably true
[06/26/2007 12:38:11 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117
[06/26/2007 12:38:17 PM] Alex Markov: not probably but definetly
[06/26/2007 12:38:24 PM] Alex Markov: i amended the email policy
[06/26/2007 12:38:52 PM] Alex Markov: if you have a problem keeping outlook open all day because of an error in your software then that error needs to be resolved
[06/26/2007 12:39:00 PM] Alex Markov: i am more than happy to help u resolve the error
[06/26/2007 12:39:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i can comply with that
[06/26/2007 12:39:14 PM] Alex Markov: such as telling you where to go to turn off automatic send and receive for a particular email
[06/26/2007 12:39:24 PM] Alex Markov: however... email on all day is important
[06/26/2007 12:39:26 PM] Alex Markov: for example
[06/26/2007 12:39:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: just as long as robert doesn't question my work
[06/26/2007 12:39:38 PM] Alex Markov: our 3rd part host tracker notifies me about ANY website being down in seconds
[06/26/2007 12:39:52 PM] Alex Markov: and we will set it up that it notifies u eventually
[06/26/2007 12:40:16 PM] Alex Markov: if a client site goes down at 11pm. and any of us are at the computer... we should get notification about that right away
[06/26/2007 12:40:56 PM] Alex Markov: we strive for quality
[06/26/2007 12:41:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you use AIM
[06/26/2007 12:41:06 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[06/26/2007 12:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the actual aim client?
[06/26/2007 12:41:14 PM] Alex Markov: yes i have aim open 24/7
[06/26/2007 12:41:21 PM] Alex Markov: rps alex markov
[06/26/2007 12:41:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: what does it do if you click forgot password?
[06/26/2007 12:41:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: does it just go to the website?
[06/26/2007 12:41:36 PM] Alex Markov: not sure enver tried
[06/26/2007 12:41:43 PM] Alex Markov: u can reset ur password on aim.com
[06/26/2007 12:41:49 PM] Alex Markov: Brian Cullinan says (3:39 PM): 
just as long as robert doesn't question my work
[06/26/2007 12:41:56 PM] Alex Markov: i have a problem with this
[06/26/2007 12:42:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/26/2007 12:42:06 PM] Alex Markov: we should all have the abiltiy to question each other's work
[06/26/2007 12:42:13 PM] Alex Markov: that is the nature of a team
[06/26/2007 12:42:21 PM] Alex Markov: that is the nature of improved effeciency
[06/26/2007 12:42:35 PM] Alex Markov: that is HOW we are going to create this smooth running machine
[06/26/2007 12:42:48 PM] Alex Markov: without CONSTANT questions... we will NOT have a smooth running machine
[06/26/2007 12:42:56 PM] Alex Markov: the more questions the smoother we get
[06/26/2007 12:42:59 PM] Alex Markov: the more moeny we make
[06/26/2007 12:43:04 PM] Alex Markov: the smoother we get the happier we are
[06/26/2007 12:43:12 PM] Alex Markov: the smoother we get the happier our clients get
[06/26/2007 12:43:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i worded it wrong, he shouldn't tell me what to work on, i have my own schedule and that always includes getting the tasks done with priority
[06/26/2007 12:43:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and since the task with the highest priority was set on hold like i explained to him, i worked on another task that he might not have known also needed to get done
[06/26/2007 12:44:03 PM] Alex Markov: he wasnt telling you. he was inquiring why a high priority task was not discussed to its maximum for the day
[06/26/2007 12:44:17 PM] Alex Markov: and that is regardless... u can tell me to do something
[06/26/2007 12:44:22 PM] Alex Markov: we should all tell each other to do things
[06/26/2007 12:44:28 PM] Alex Markov: like just a couple hours ago
[06/26/2007 12:44:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i know you need to do something i will might remind you
[06/26/2007 12:44:46 PM] Alex Markov: i TOLD bobby to look at something for a client because the general manager of botnick chevrolet called me
[06/26/2007 12:44:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there are dozens of things you have to do every day that i have no idea about
[06/26/2007 12:45:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be completely hypocritical for me to tell another manager what they should be doing
[06/26/2007 12:45:15 PM] Alex Markov: no. there will be times we will need to TELL each other to do things. and i mean u can strictly ORDER me to do things. 
[06/26/2007 12:45:30 PM] Alex Markov: i completely disagree. 
[06/26/2007 12:45:54 PM] Alex Markov: it is jsut like in a basketball game. one team member can go tell another team member to go to that part of the court
[06/26/2007 12:45:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are all responsible all we should need is the occasional reminder
[06/26/2007 12:46:18 PM] Alex Markov: but we live in an ever present chaotic startup phase right now. 
[06/26/2007 12:46:25 PM] Alex Markov: and even after startup
[06/26/2007 12:46:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i could tell you for example to call NYB and don't hang up until you get an answer, but that doesn't have priority over say, filing taxes that are due the next day
[06/26/2007 12:46:58 PM] Alex Markov: u need to have thicker skin and not take orders persoanlly. because they are not meant to be evil
[06/26/2007 12:47:06 PM] Alex Markov: when shit needs to get done we must do it
[06/26/2007 12:47:41 PM] Alex Markov: i mean there will always be exceptions
[06/26/2007 12:47:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know, but i don't know your list of priorities, i can't demand that you do something of a lower priority just because i tell you to
[06/26/2007 12:48:03 PM] Alex Markov: but if u tell me to call nyb right now to get clarification on something. i should have to do it. and i should not get angry about it that u tell me what to work on
[06/26/2007 12:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i would expect you to call them, but if you told me you were working with another client i wouldn't question why you are doing that over something else
[06/26/2007 12:49:14 PM] Alex Markov: bobby told u respond to the email. and u disliked it. that was not ok bro. we should not get defensive when we telle ach other something
[06/26/2007 12:49:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, i would have been more then happy to respond, he questioned why i was working
[06/26/2007 12:49:56 PM] Alex Markov: bobby had a valid inquiry... why u had not responded to his last email
[06/26/2007 12:50:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: no that was not his inquiry, he asked why i was working on svn
[06/26/2007 12:50:54 PM] Alex Markov: yes why u were working on svn when u had not respnded to his last email
[06/26/2007 12:50:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i could have replied, "because its on my list of things to do"
[06/26/2007 12:51:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: or because i didn't get his last e-mail
[06/26/2007 12:51:28 PM] Alex Markov: yes but it happens alot... when we tell each toher to drop what we are doing and handle something
[06/26/2007 12:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: he should not be so inquisitive 
[06/26/2007 12:51:40 PM] Alex Markov: we should all be so inquisitive
[06/26/2007 12:51:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: futhermore, he still didn't answer my question
[06/26/2007 12:53:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would rather be direct
[06/26/2007 12:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: inquisitive just makes people sound like smartasses
[06/26/2007 12:54:13 PM] Alex Markov: the problem as i see it is u get defensive over certain things. have u ever seen me get defensive? no. i beleive that "defensive" is not a productive quality of team work
[06/26/2007 12:54:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have no problem with people asking me to do things, and i think something needs to be done i will express it
[06/26/2007 12:55:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get defensive when people question my work ethic, thats what it comes down to, including answering e-mails
[06/26/2007 12:55:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know i work hard, and if people question that, then they are the ones with the problem of not being able to see that
[06/26/2007 12:56:04 PM] Alex Markov: i disagree. lol. i am making a new policy
[06/26/2007 12:56:21 PM] Alex Markov: defensiveness is banned across the board. and that means dealing with clients and developers and everything
[06/26/2007 12:56:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you just don't question my work ethic we would never have a problem
[06/26/2007 12:57:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of questioning it be appreciative of it
[06/26/2007 01:10:11 PM] Alex Markov: sec ill show u the new policies and u can tell me if u haver things to add to it
[06/26/2007 01:10:16 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=200#post200)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?p=200#post200

[06/26/2007 01:14:09 PM] Alex Markov: do u have any things we can add to that?
[06/26/2007 01:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should be direct with questions and assertive
[06/26/2007 01:21:18 PM] Alex Markov: the post is regarding things we are banning
[06/26/2007 01:21:27 PM] Alex Markov: not things we are promoting
[06/26/2007 01:21:34 PM] Alex Markov: i dont think there is a huge need to outline good things
[06/26/2007 01:23:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: then maybe racism
[06/26/2007 01:23:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: sexism
[06/26/2007 01:23:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: prejudice
[06/26/2007 01:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: prejudice is a big out
[06/26/2007 01:23:35 PM] Alex Markov: oh good point
[06/26/2007 01:23:38 PM] Alex Markov: ill add it sec
[06/26/2007 01:23:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert pre judges my knowledge of things all the time
[06/26/2007 01:23:51 PM] Alex Markov: agreed
[06/26/2007 01:25:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish you could just temporarily turn off an account in outlook
[06/26/2007 01:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: why does software have to suck so much
[06/26/2007 01:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: dreamweaver blows
[06/26/2007 01:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: unfortunately its the best software out there for this kind of work
[06/26/2007 01:26:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: g2g shower
[06/26/2007 01:29:58 PM] Alex Markov: at the top. go to tools> send and receive> send and receive settings> define send and receive groups
[06/26/2007 01:30:10 PM] Alex Markov: in there u can define which accounts u want to be set on auto send and receive
[06/26/2007 01:30:23 PM] Alex Markov: just disable ur accounts that prompt u with an error
[06/26/2007 01:46:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: excellent

1. Homepage Errors: In IE7 the layout of the homepage is a little off. It needs to look like it has no errors. Here is screenshot of what I see.  

[06/26/2007 04:33:33 PM] Alex Markov: -DONE
[06/26/2007 04:33:40 PM] Alex Markov: like just type right under my changes

[06/26/2007 04:34:00 PM] Alex Markov: yes please
[06/26/2007 04:34:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: *i sent it again
[06/26/2007 04:37:00 PM] Alex Markov: see how i was a bit unclear. i dont want to waste time decrypting emails. u jumped into talking about #3 and then talked about #1 and then again about #3
[06/26/2007 04:37:16 PM] Alex Markov: also i would like it if you confirmed which changes u did as DONE
[06/26/2007 04:37:23 PM] Alex Markov: but whatever, we will make a protcol for changes soon
[06/26/2007 04:38:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if i didn't list them you can assume they are done
[06/26/2007 04:38:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only explained the points that had issues
[06/26/2007 04:39:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: your e-mail was nicely numbered too, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2
[06/26/2007 04:39:09 PM] Alex Markov: change #3 regarding the checkout poage... that is not an email that sends ou
[06/26/2007 04:39:29 PM] Alex Markov: it is the page customers see at checkout
[06/26/2007 04:41:43 PM] Alex Markov: oh and u da man about the click to enlarge thing
[06/26/2007 04:41:45 PM] Alex Markov: good shit
[06/26/2007 04:42:40 PM] Alex Markov: in my email i mentioned that we need manfucaturers to be in alphabetical order. u somehow made categories in alphabetical but not manufacturers. is an easy way to do so
[06/26/2007 04:42:43 PM] Alex Markov: is there
[06/26/2007 04:43:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i must have missed that point let me check
[06/26/2007 04:44:12 PM] Alex Markov: u da man about moving the savings down. we just earned more product real estate so we can make images larger

[06/26/2007 04:44:54 PM] Alex Markov: in IE7 the prices are a larger font for some reason
[06/26/2007 05:05:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: the manufacturers have to be manually sorted
[06/26/2007 05:05:51 PM] Alex Markov: in xcart or code?

[06/26/2007 05:06:19 PM] Alex Markov: new policy
[06/26/2007 05:06:28 PM] Alex Markov: this goes for EVERYONE
[06/26/2007 05:06:36 PM] Alex Markov: if robert forgets to put info into pmxp... 
[06/26/2007 05:06:39 PM] Alex Markov: and continues to do so
[06/26/2007 05:06:51 PM] Alex Markov: we will start knocking money he is owed
[06/26/2007 05:06:54 PM] Alex Markov: same goes for me
[06/26/2007 05:08:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: in the xcart admin sections
[06/26/2007 05:08:16 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[06/26/2007 05:08:23 PM] Alex Markov: let me know ur opinion about policy ordinance
[06/26/2007 05:10:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah absolutely not
[06/26/2007 05:10:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats definitely not how it works in the real world
[06/26/2007 05:11:10 PM] Alex Markov: alot of my ideas come directly from the corporate world... i got to read the managers handbook at the Gap
[06/26/2007 05:11:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah penalizing someone on their pay check is not appropriate
[06/26/2007 05:11:37 PM] Alex Markov: if people do not follow policies at the Gap.... they are put on suspension
[06/26/2007 05:11:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree there should be a penalty, but definitely not taking money from them
[06/26/2007 05:11:55 PM] Alex Markov: hummm
[06/26/2007 05:12:03 PM] Alex Markov: do u have any suggestion what then?
[06/26/2007 05:12:28 PM] Alex Markov: 1 week suspension will only hurt the company. we cant just suspend a manager in the future. its only gonna used in extreme cases
[06/26/2007 05:13:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah thats just not the right way to handle it
[06/26/2007 05:13:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: we're not employing 5 year olds
[06/26/2007 05:14:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: if everyone does what they need to there should be that kind of problem
[06/26/2007 05:14:32 PM] Alex Markov: i completely agree. however... there NEEDs to be some kind of penalties in the background
[06/26/2007 05:15:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, but not taking money off paychecks for a simple mistake
[06/26/2007 05:16:29 PM] Alex Markov: this isnt gonna be for one time things
[06/26/2007 05:16:39 PM] Alex Markov: its like if bobby continue and conitnues to not add passwords into pmxp
[06/26/2007 05:16:46 PM] Alex Markov: he knows he will get docked $100
[06/26/2007 05:18:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm
[06/26/2007 05:19:42 PM] Alex Markov: i dont think we will ever use the $100 penalty
[06/26/2007 05:22:14 PM] Alex Markov: mainly its just a deterant. policies and protocols are important
[06/26/2007 05:22:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes they are
[06/26/2007 05:23:01 PM] Alex Markov: we need to create such a structure for future staff that there cant be mistakes. its like a machine
[06/26/2007 05:28:36 PM] Alex Markov: i dont know. for now i am inclided to keep the monetary penalties. however... if u have any good ideas let me know
[06/26/2007 05:28:56 PM] Alex Markov: my logic is this
[06/26/2007 05:29:05 PM] Alex Markov: say bobby breaks a protocol. we tell him. he broke it
[06/26/2007 05:29:18 PM] Alex Markov: then he breaks it again... and we tell him he is liable to be penalized $100
[06/26/2007 05:29:39 PM] Alex Markov: then he breaks it again! and we are like "yo, WTF bobby! follow the policy!"
[06/26/2007 05:29:52 PM] Alex Markov: and we are like "ok u are now deducted $100"
[06/26/2007 05:30:03 PM] Alex Markov: and he is like "ok sorry sorry, give me one final chance!"
[06/26/2007 05:30:12 PM] Alex Markov: and we are like "ok, fine one final chance"
[06/26/2007 05:30:17 PM] Alex Markov: i promise that he wont break it them
[06/26/2007 05:30:18 PM] Alex Markov: then
[06/26/2007 05:30:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[06/26/2007 05:30:38 PM] Alex Markov: and then if he is stupid to do it... then RPS gets $100
[06/26/2007 05:32:00 PM] Alex Markov: like if its an honest mistake... then there will never be penalties
[06/26/2007 05:34:48 PM] Alex Markov: but repeated, deliberate laziness and disregard for policies need to have SOME kind of penalty
[06/26/2007 05:35:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess
[06/26/2007 05:55:31 PM] Alex Markov: u still using trillian? or on msn
[06/26/2007 05:55:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: trillian
[06/26/2007 05:56:10 PM] Alex Markov: u got icon to work i see

[06/26/2007 05:56:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/26/2007 06:18:49 PM] Alex Markov: can u see my away message?

[06/26/2007 06:19:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[06/26/2007 06:19:53 PM] Alex Markov: mainly we are playing around with thoughts of like an away message system to notify others of our availability
[06/26/2007 06:20:00 PM] Alex Markov: for example.... when we go to lunch or dinner....
[06/26/2007 06:20:03 PM] Alex Markov: or client meeting

[06/29/2007 01:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: stuck? like getting payment?
[06/29/2007 01:35:58 PM] Alex Markov: ffz is a massive disaster. not sure if that project will finish
[06/29/2007 01:36:05 PM] Alex Markov: and rps has major issues
[06/29/2007 01:36:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: the rps website? or company as a whole?
[06/29/2007 01:36:32 PM] Alex Markov: company as a whole

[06/29/2007 02:04:50 PM] Alex Markov: bobby completely and utterly mismanaged FFZ. its not his fault tho because i was the HPM and i should have been on top of it. bobby says there were no protocols in place. wich i agree. i feel he should have done things differently... but it was also my fault for not making sure tings were not differently
[06/29/2007 02:06:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so whats wrong with rps?
[06/29/2007 02:06:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have protocols now
[06/29/2007 02:06:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: are we not going to get paid for ffz?
[06/29/2007 02:06:44 PM] Alex Markov: probably not
[06/29/2007 02:06:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we take down their website
[06/29/2007 02:06:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we keep the template
[06/29/2007 02:07:22 PM] Alex Markov: yes we need to salvage it somehow hpefully
[06/29/2007 02:07:28 PM] Alex Markov: maybe sell it on template monster
[06/29/2007 02:07:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely
[06/29/2007 02:07:46 PM] Alex Markov: ffz rly pissed me off today. i spoke with one of them and tey completely lied
[06/29/2007 02:08:05 PM] Alex Markov: its our fault
[06/29/2007 02:08:11 PM] Alex Markov: we need to standardize EVERYTHINNGGGGGGGGGGGG

[06/29/2007 02:09:18 PM] Alex Markov: nothing he can say
[06/29/2007 02:09:23 PM] Alex Markov: we should have done a totally new contract
[06/29/2007 02:09:34 PM] Alex Markov: and charged them for a reorganization 
[06/29/2007 02:09:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: well thats to bad
[06/29/2007 02:10:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so are we quitting that project?
[06/29/2007 02:10:39 PM] Alex Markov: internally... we need svn up. we need wbesite up. we need project protocols up. we need accounting up. and we need workflows up
[06/29/2007 02:11:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: svn is up, i will put the protocol in the forum right now

[07/02/2007 11:09:05 AM] Alex Markov: like how we are gonna upload a file.... and then work on it... and then like when we should check it out
[07/02/2007 11:09:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: When using tortoiseSVN use the checkout command to check out entire directories. 
 You must check out whole directories, so create folders on your own computer to use for company information. 
 Use a similar file system like the ones provided in the SVN. 
 Use tortoise to commit changes as soon as you are finished working on a document or website. 
 If previous versions of documents are needed tortoiseSVN can access other revisions using the Log. 
  
 EVERY DOCUMENT SHOULD BE SAVED IN THE SVN.  This is very helpful when referring to previous versions.  Don't be conservative, SVN storage is very efficient and can handle lots of files and changes.
[07/02/2007 11:10:29 AM] Alex Markov: its not clear enough. like should we create the exact file strcutre on our computers?
[07/02/2007 11:10:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: Use a similar file system like the ones provided in the SVN.

[07/16/2007 06:04:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: to better match our protocols
[07/16/2007 06:05:09 PM] Brian Cullinan:       PM Management       
      PM Staff      
      PM Upper Management
[07/16/2007 06:05:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: those need changing
[07/16/2007 06:06:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: HPM2
[07/16/2007 06:06:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that the same as PM Staff?
[07/16/2007 06:07:12 PM] Alex Markov: no
[07/16/2007 06:07:16 PM] Alex Markov: pm staff are just PMs
[07/16/2007 06:07:26 PM] Alex Markov: PM mananagement are all HPMs
[07/16/2007 06:07:41 PM] Alex Markov: PM upper management is PM president and vice president
[07/16/2007 06:07:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so pm management is HMP2?
[07/16/2007 06:07:58 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[07/16/2007 06:08:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok which one should we change
[07/16/2007 06:08:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: lets change the protocol to PM Management instead of HPM2
[07/16/2007 06:08:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: as opposed to changing sugar
[07/16/2007 06:14:16 PM] Alex Markov: do what you think is best and implement it. make the executive decision
[07/16/2007 06:15:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: wtf i need more admin in the forum i can't edit your post

[07/18/2007 09:11:31 AM] Alex Markov: in 2007 RPS LLC is filing a separate tax return and stuff

[07/18/2007 03:00:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: a bad
[07/18/2007 03:00:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: *bar
[07/18/2007 03:00:58 PM] Alex Markov: where. in ohio?
[07/18/2007 03:01:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/18/2007 03:01:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be an awesome portfolio site
[07/18/2007 03:01:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: and add some diversity to our portfolio
[07/18/2007 03:01:52 PM] Alex Markov: excellent point
[07/18/2007 03:02:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do you go about getting a price on a taken domain name?
[07/18/2007 03:02:32 PM] Alex Markov: whats the domain
[07/18/2007 03:02:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: the name is brewskys, so brewskys.com is taken and their website absolutely sucks
[07/18/2007 03:02:44 PM] Alex Markov: u now the owner?
[07/18/2007 03:03:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the alternative spelling that we would also want to claim in brewskies.com and their entire site is full of just links to other sites
[07/18/2007 03:03:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is the owner
[07/18/2007 03:03:20 PM] Alex Markov: nice
[07/18/2007 03:03:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the bar manager is who we would be working with the most and shes so nice and so fuckin hot
[07/18/2007 03:03:39 PM] Alex Markov: ill call them tomorow
[07/18/2007 03:04:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok excellent, i want to develope a good relation with them, they wouldn't need a new website for a few months, so by then i could hope to be PM
[07/18/2007 03:04:36 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[07/18/2007 03:05:04 PM] Alex Markov: u think because ur dad is the owner he will let you do the redesign?
[07/18/2007 03:05:07 PM] Alex Markov: we dont ened to charge so much either
[07/18/2007 03:05:16 PM] Alex Markov: u will get experience as a pm
[07/18/2007 03:05:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is actually half owner, greg is his friend and the other owner, for these two, money is no object, and they have a strong sense of class, so that will reflect in the web design
[07/18/2007 03:05:24 PM] Alex Markov: and working with some of our graphic people
[07/18/2007 03:05:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: no that not their website, they don't own the domain, but they need it for their bar
[07/18/2007 03:06:00 PM] Alex Markov: well i dont invision the site being anything SO featurefilled. so that means we can really put soem effort into the design
[07/18/2007 03:06:20 PM] Alex Markov: effort and budget into the design primarily
[07/18/2007 03:06:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes the design will be the biggest part
[07/18/2007 03:06:29 PM] Alex Markov: make it the best looking bar website in america
[07/18/2007 03:06:41 PM] Alex Markov: fancy flash
[07/18/2007 03:06:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i didn't even ask my dad to do it, i asked the bar owner and she was enthusiastic
[07/18/2007 03:06:51 PM] Alex Markov: excellent
[07/18/2007 03:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/18/2007 03:07:12 PM] Alex Markov: stay on top of it. it will be a perfect starting PM project for you. hopefully theprotocols are all up 100%
[07/18/2007 03:07:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but first step is to get ownership of domains
[07/18/2007 03:07:54 PM] Alex Markov: we need all of us to do the protocols ourelves. because when we hire people we all need to be sharp and know them in and out
[07/18/2007 03:08:00 PM] Alex Markov: that is often difficult
[07/18/2007 03:08:06 PM] Alex Markov: i will track them down
[07/18/2007 03:08:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: also this bar is in ohio, so prefixes like brewskysoh, would also be appropriate
[07/18/2007 03:08:28 PM] Alex Markov: but people are stuborn alot. or move and just dont have updated contact info 
[07/18/2007 03:08:35 PM] Alex Markov: yeah we will explore all options
[07/18/2007 03:08:37 PM] Alex Markov: brb
[07/18/2007 03:08:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but these 2 domains look shitty, look at brewskys.com and brewskies.com
[07/18/2007 03:10:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: just start the bid low because their websites suck ass
[07/18/2007 03:10:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and what are some of the other websites we have done that i can send in an e-mail to the client to show off our portfolio
[07/18/2007 03:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: botnick
[07/18/2007 03:12:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesome site
[07/18/2007 03:22:40 PM] Alex Markov: try to delay sending them portfolio
[07/18/2007 03:23:04 PM] Alex Markov: in a month our website will be done. DCITP will be redesigned, XAN will be redesigned, and NYB will be finished
[07/18/2007 03:23:13 PM] Alex Markov: we will look rly sweet in a monyth

[07/20/2007 12:37:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i had to learn everything i know from someone else teaching me, it would take me 20 years to get where i am today, figure shit out by yourself, you don't always need everyone to guide you step by step

[07/20/2007 01:31:00 PM] Alex Markov: For creating a Subversion repository on the server: 
All repositories are placed under "/home/rps/svn/" 
1. Create a folder relating to the main contents of the repository 
2. Use the following command to create the config files: 
svnadmin create /home/rps/svn// 
3. Run the following command to start the daemon if it is not already running: 
svnserve -d -r /home/rps/svn/ 
4. Connect using a subversion cl
[07/20/2007 01:31:04 PM] Alex Markov: i suppose its in that

[07/26/2007 05:27:32 AM] Alex Markov: seems ata-6 is backward compatible
[07/26/2007 05:28:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it will work
[07/26/2007 05:28:49 AM] Alex Markov: k thaks
[07/26/2007 05:29:03 AM] Alex Markov: did u make that change to nyb maufacturers yesterdasy? when i went to try it again it was working
[07/26/2007 05:29:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: no i didn't i thought you would have robert do it
[07/26/2007 05:31:37 AM] Alex Markov: i was gonna and when i was typing up the bug... i couldnt reproduce it so i thought u fixed it
[07/26/2007 05:31:38 AM] Alex Markov: weird
[07/26/2007 05:34:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: your dumb
[07/26/2007 05:35:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: you may only add spaces, dashes, and underscores, not entire fucking words
[07/26/2007 05:35:45 AM] Alex Markov: what?

[07/26/2007 05:36:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: read the directions
[07/26/2007 05:37:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: but most the other things are genuine problems i will look into them when i get back
[07/26/2007 05:38:04 AM] Alex Markov: directions need to be clarified then. because i am tech savy. and i STILL dont udnerstand exactly what you mean
[07/26/2007 05:39:13 AM] Alex Markov: i literally was stuck on that for like a minute
[07/26/2007 05:39:42 AM] Alex Markov: call me dumb... but i am willing to bet ALOT of people will have same problem. and a big percentage of them may just give up
[07/26/2007 05:40:12 AM] Alex Markov: i read and reread the instructions and couldnt figure out what to edit
[07/26/2007 05:42:50 AM] Alex Markov: everything we do targeting the general public needs to be as easy and snag free as possible

[08/01/2007 09:40:04 AM] Alex Markov: did u ever play with legos when u were a kid?
[08/01/2007 09:40:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/01/2007 09:40:33 AM] Alex Markov: ok well picture RPS as the legos when u first took them ouf ot eh box of one of those BIG lego pieces
[08/01/2007 09:40:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: but if you are going into some analogy can we skip it and get to the good stuff
[08/01/2007 09:40:42 AM] Alex Markov: thats how RPS was a year ago
[08/01/2007 09:40:50 AM] Alex Markov: lol
[08/01/2007 09:41:10 AM] Alex Markov: nbow RPS is almost finished and we jsut need to push and do everything we need. such as the trims and details to get it done

[08/01/2007 09:44:08 AM] Alex Markov: but ok good
[08/01/2007 09:44:13 AM] Alex Markov: so that is the general list
[08/01/2007 09:44:23 AM] Alex Markov: work on them in that order
[08/01/2007 09:44:41 AM] Alex Markov: and really put effort into each one. like for knowledge base.... make sure it is done right and is finished and looks sleek
[08/01/2007 09:44:49 AM] Alex Markov: if it takes u all day saturday to get it 100%.... then so be it
[08/01/2007 09:45:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to robert about knowledge base
[08/01/2007 09:45:06 AM] Alex Markov: we are so close here brian
[08/01/2007 09:45:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need to purchase that other one
[08/01/2007 09:45:15 AM] Alex Markov: which other one?
[08/01/2007 09:45:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: because it would be a pain in the ass to remove the entire helpdesk from cerberus
[08/01/2007 09:45:53 AM] Alex Markov: why are we removing the helpdesk i thought we were going to use the helpdesk
[08/01/2007 09:45:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't make any sense, we will spend just as much time trying to remove all the features we don't want as it does for them to develope it
[08/01/2007 09:46:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: robert says he doesn't want to use the helpdesk
[08/01/2007 09:46:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: you guys didn't talk about this?
[08/01/2007 09:46:16 AM] Alex Markov: did he give a reason
[08/01/2007 09:46:24 AM] Alex Markov: we touched base on it briefly
[08/01/2007 09:46:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: the way i left it with robert is as follows:
[08/01/2007 09:47:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: we should either use the helpdesk or use the other KB we had picked out, it would take more time then it is worth to remove the entire helpdesk, and finally i don't want to skin the admin side of it to match our website, no one but us will see the admin side and it would also be a waste of time
[08/01/2007 09:48:06 AM] Alex Markov: can u link me to alternative kb?
[08/01/2007 09:48:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: he said he had another part to run the helpdesk and the KB should be completely seperate incase of a server crash or some shit
[08/01/2007 09:48:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll see if i can find it
[08/01/2007 09:48:54 AM] Alex Markov: regarding skinning the admin... we will eventually skin all our admins... it doesnt matter if no one will see it but RPS staff. When we bring in new staff members... it will look ULTRA sexy to have internal areas that look like RPS
[08/01/2007 09:49:03 AM] Alex Markov: appearances are very important
[08/01/2007 09:49:38 AM] Alex Markov: i put it on my list to discuss it with him today
[08/01/2007 09:49:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: not with admin sections, it is way to much of a pain in the ass to try and skin someone else's admin section
[08/01/2007 09:50:10 AM] Alex Markov: what do u mean someone else's? its our admin sections
[08/01/2007 09:50:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: if we were writing it all ourselves it would be easy, but since the output is the part the programmer intended to be skinned thats the only part that should be
[08/01/2007 09:50:28 AM] Alex Markov: oh i see
[08/01/2007 09:50:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: no cpanel was written by someone else, even though we own it, it is not our code
[08/01/2007 09:50:50 AM] Alex Markov: which part of cpanel did bobby want to get skinned?
[08/01/2007 09:51:20 AM] Alex Markov: cpanel comes with a skin and template selector. all it would take is to select skin or template. i forget what it is called
[08/01/2007 09:51:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: same with the KB, the programmers intended for the clients (us) to be able to skin the output for it, infact that go as far as to make them completely seperate projects, we are not supposed to skin their admin section
[08/01/2007 09:52:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: even though cpanel comes with skinning abilities it would still be a waste of time, cerberus on the other hand doesn't have any skinning abilities for the admin section
[08/01/2007 09:52:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it would be a waste of time to try and create that
[08/01/2007 09:52:38 AM] Alex Markov: just because we are not supposed to do something doesnt mean it isnt a good idea. look at our forums. no one sees them but they are hot! we eventually need all our internal shit to be branded with the RPS style. 
[08/01/2007 09:53:21 AM] Alex Markov: we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. however... keeping consistent style in EVERYTHING we do will make us a stronger company. even if it takes a little extra time
[08/01/2007 09:53:47 AM] Alex Markov: maybe not a total skin. but colors can definetly be changed without terrible reprecussions
[08/01/2007 09:53:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: the forums are a different story, kind of like cpanel they are meant to be skinned, and picking out a premade style for the forums and changing the logo is a lot easier then trying to skin something that is not intended to be skinned
[08/01/2007 09:54:02 AM] Alex Markov: cerberus runs of a css file somewhere
[08/01/2007 09:54:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: lots of things use css files
[08/01/2007 09:54:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: anyways i am not going to make skinning the admin section a part of my task for the KB
[08/01/2007 09:55:01 AM] Alex Markov: yeah but who cares if it isnt easy. we all do crazy hard and annouying things. we jsut gotta suck it up and keep pushing forward. thats the bottom line. stop looking at things as easy or hard.
[08/01/2007 09:55:10 AM] Alex Markov: im not saying this is gonna get done in enxt few weeks
[08/01/2007 09:55:20 AM] Alex Markov: but we are going to put RPS style on EVERYTHINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
[08/01/2007 09:55:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: if we want to do something more with it later thats fine and i will help, but there are more important things that need to get done then skinning an admin section
[08/01/2007 09:55:39 AM] Alex Markov: agreed
[08/01/2007 09:55:56 AM] Alex Markov: can u find that alternative kb?
[08/01/2007 09:56:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't but robert would know what i am talking about
[08/01/2007 09:56:47 AM] Alex Markov: ok thats fine
[08/01/2007 09:56:56 AM] Alex Markov: ill discuss it with him 
[08/01/2007 09:56:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: so that was the only task i was not sure about
[08/01/2007 09:57:02 AM] Alex Markov: dont start on the kb until u hear from me
[08/01/2007 09:57:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/01/2007 09:57:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: what is the next item on the list for this meeting/
[08/01/2007 09:58:07 AM] Alex Markov: thats it. we just needed to touch base on your tasks. today was the day u were going to work full time so i had this in my schedule. but if u need til saturday... we will live with it

[08/01/2007 10:30:54 AM] Alex Markov: because microsoft is dumb and windows mobile is buggy
[08/01/2007 10:31:26 AM] Alex Markov: that only happens to me when i put the sd card in 
[08/01/2007 10:31:33 AM] Alex Markov: my sd card is always in
[08/01/2007 10:31:41 AM] Alex Markov: it only happens when i take it out and put it back
[08/01/2007 10:33:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: mine happens every time it wakes up
[08/01/2007 10:34:22 AM] Alex Markov: weird

[08/01/2007 11:10:57 AM] Alex Markov: regarding kb
[08/01/2007 11:11:48 AM] Alex Markov: i think we should take the time to just install a 2nd cerberus with kb only
[08/01/2007 11:12:02 AM] Alex Markov: so when we decide to upgrade helpdesk in the future. the kb wont be affected
[08/01/2007 11:12:19 AM] Alex Markov: from what i udnrstand it is not a MASSIVE job
[08/01/2007 11:15:25 AM] Alex Markov: ok?
[08/01/2007 11:17:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: from my understanding it is a massive job to remove helpdesk from KB
[08/01/2007 11:18:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: unless it already comes with just the KB and no helpdesk
[08/01/2007 11:18:10 AM] Alex Markov: robert has been using cerberus for several years now and says it is not so complicated to just remove the helpdesk and leave kb
[08/01/2007 11:18:30 AM] Alex Markov: if he is wrong. then he wil be wrong and we can call him a douche. but he think it is possible without too much bullshit. so lets do it
[08/01/2007 11:18:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok i will work on it first thing saturday
[08/01/2007 11:19:01 AM] Alex Markov: ok good
[08/01/2007 11:19:09 AM] Alex Markov: try your best. it may not be so complicated
[08/01/2007 11:19:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: god i hope not
[08/01/2007 11:20:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: my time is valuable
[08/01/2007 11:20:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: all our time is
[08/01/2007 11:20:41 AM] Alex Markov: yes. i trust bobby's opinion and i think it will work
[08/01/2007 11:21:17 AM] Alex Markov: if u can show me an alternative we can buy... let me see it
[08/01/2007 11:21:26 AM] Alex Markov: but we already paid for cerberus and we are on a tight budget
[08/01/2007 11:21:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: ask robert the name of the alternative
[08/01/2007 11:21:40 AM] Alex Markov: he cant find it either
[08/01/2007 11:21:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i thought it looked nicer and was dedicated to only being a KB
[08/01/2007 11:21:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: he said it was $140
[08/01/2007 11:22:22 AM] Alex Markov: yeah but our budget is tight and kb is not that important anyway. most of our clients wont even use it. we just need some kind of knowledge base tho

[08/05/2007 12:32:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: answer my damn question
[08/05/2007 12:33:04 PM] Alex Markov: "i was fucking getting to that" that is not appropriate bro. i do not respond to ulike that. chill. 
[08/05/2007 12:33:10 PM] Alex Markov: yeah do what u think is best
[08/05/2007 12:33:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was working on cerberus first, and trying to figure out how i could possibly remove any entire system
[08/05/2007 12:33:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys are so pushy with that "order of tasks" bullshit, if i reach a point at which i can't continue, and no one is around to help be resolve the issue, should i sit around waiting or work on something else?
[08/05/2007 12:34:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was waiting for you to discuss this KB, you weren't around i even left a message, so i started working on leads
[08/05/2007 12:34:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho
[08/05/2007 12:35:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was looking at the KB admin section again, and it would take more work then it is worth to remove the entire helpdesk
[08/05/2007 12:35:25 PM] Alex Markov: yes that is fine. but tell me what. when i first messege you. tell me  item by item what the upgrade is. i do the same to robert. robert does same to me. 
[08/05/2007 12:35:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: want the info to log in so you can see what i am talking about?
[08/05/2007 12:35:27 PM] Alex Markov: just do it
[08/05/2007 12:35:35 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[08/05/2007 12:35:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://kb.rp-s.com/cerberus-gui/)http://kb.rp-s.com/cerberus-gui/
[08/05/2007 12:35:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't just do it is the thing
[08/05/2007 12:35:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is entirely integrated
[08/05/2007 12:36:00 PM] Alex Markov: "you guys are so pushy with that "order of tasks" bullshit" 
[08/05/2007 12:36:03 PM] Alex Markov: that is the way it is
[08/05/2007 12:36:06 PM] Alex Markov: some things need to get done
[08/05/2007 12:36:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: enter superuser for username and password
[08/05/2007 12:36:12 PM] Alex Markov: dont complainjsut do it
[08/05/2007 12:36:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: just log in and look at what i am talking about
[08/05/2007 12:36:48 PM] Alex Markov: doing it
[08/05/2007 12:36:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: then entire thing is based on the helpdesk
[08/05/2007 12:37:20 PM] Alex Markov: u are installing a brand new version
[08/05/2007 12:37:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: address book, reports, teamwork, dashboard, those all use the helpdesk, you can't just pick and choose which half to use
[08/05/2007 12:37:36 PM] Alex Markov: we are not using the enw version ebcause it is really expensive and kinda acts dumb
[08/05/2007 12:38:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the one robert told me to download and use, but i doubt the concepts have changed
[08/05/2007 12:38:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a helpdesk with a KB built on top of it, if i remove the helpdesk everything else will fall apart
[08/05/2007 12:38:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not skinnable, so to make it match rp-s we would have to completely rewrite their code
[08/05/2007 12:39:02 PM] Alex Markov: the new hekpdesk is COMPLETELY different than past version. they changed it all
[08/05/2007 12:39:20 PM] Alex Markov: write that up briefly...
[08/05/2007 12:39:24 PM] Alex Markov: and send it to my email
[08/05/2007 12:39:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't change the fact that the helpdesk is entirely implemented into the KB
[08/05/2007 12:39:30 PM] Alex Markov: and move on to new task
[08/05/2007 12:39:51 PM] Alex Markov: ok thats fine, just write it up and email right now
[08/05/2007 12:39:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright, and i found the link to robert's alternative
[08/05/2007 12:41:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: the paypal stuff is going to take me a lot more then a day, you sure that should be next on the list when i can knock off some of the other tasks quicker?
[08/05/2007 12:42:00 PM] Alex Markov: yes move onto the paypal
[08/05/2007 12:42:19 PM] Alex Markov: writeup the kb issues and email me. if u are sure it cannot be done
[08/05/2007 12:42:24 PM] Alex Markov: try the older version of cerberus

[08/05/2007 01:07:18 PM] Alex Markov: install that
[08/05/2007 01:07:22 PM] Alex Markov: its the new sugar kb addone
[08/05/2007 01:07:24 PM] Alex Markov: addon
[08/05/2007 01:08:50 PM] Alex Markov: we will give it a bit of a test run before we decide to spend $135
[08/05/2007 01:10:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking damnit
[08/05/2007 01:10:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i lost the password
[08/05/2007 01:10:35 PM] Alex Markov: for what
[08/05/2007 01:10:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: why can't we make all the fucking user names and passwords the same for cpanel and ftp and sql
[08/05/2007 01:10:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: its pissing me off
[08/05/2007 01:11:56 PM] Alex Markov: security
[08/05/2007 01:12:07 PM] Alex Markov: all passwords should be different. just deal with it
[08/05/2007 01:12:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesome, its not in PMXP
[08/05/2007 01:12:56 PM] Alex Markov: yay
[08/05/2007 01:13:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a point where you have security like an 8 digit randomass password, but we have crossed security into ridiculous and paranoid
[08/05/2007 01:13:06 PM] Alex Markov: this is for azrn correct?
[08/05/2007 01:13:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/05/2007 01:13:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: forget it i am switching over to testing account which i do have the password info for
[08/05/2007 01:14:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is also annoying as hell because every time i want to change something on the live site i have to ask robert and re upload shit and it gets completely out of hand and disorganized
[08/05/2007 01:14:28 PM] Alex Markov: if u want me to talk to robert about tha fact that the pw is not in pmxp... let me know. send me an email and tell me what passwords are not in pmxp that should be
[08/05/2007 01:14:54 PM] Alex Markov: start using pmxp hotkeys. it makes it much easier
[08/05/2007 01:15:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: pmxp is gay
[08/05/2007 01:15:23 PM] Alex Markov: it is what it is. we will consider an alternative in the future
[08/05/2007 01:15:25 PM] Alex Markov: move on
[08/05/2007 01:15:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to find a new one that supports multi users simultaneously
[08/05/2007 01:15:44 PM] Alex Markov: do it another time
[08/05/2007 01:15:53 PM] Alex Markov: we have a HUGE week ahead of us

[08/05/2007 01:18:53 PM] Alex Markov: its very important
[08/05/2007 01:22:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have no idea how this upgrade works, can't you get robert to do it?
[08/05/2007 01:25:03 PM] Alex Markov: just do it bro. we all do rly undesirable things.

[08/05/2007 01:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are no instuctions in the zip file
[08/05/2007 01:27:01 PM] Alex Markov: search pp website

[08/05/2007 02:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i suggested to robert about making a custom KB script using the forum
[08/05/2007 02:32:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought it was a good idea
[08/05/2007 02:33:12 PM] Alex Markov: how hard would that be
[08/05/2007 02:33:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: we just make a section in the forum like Knowledge Base, and under that we have all the sections we want, so all we would have to worry about is the script that prints it out on the website
[08/05/2007 02:34:10 PM] Alex Markov: ok ill talk to r about it
[08/05/2007 02:34:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already did
[08/05/2007 02:34:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: he doesn'
[08/05/2007 02:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: t like the idea
[08/05/2007 02:35:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: this whole stupid seperating help desk from the KB is based on the idea that if the server crashes the users should still be able to get to the KB
[08/05/2007 02:35:55 PM] Alex Markov: its also based on the fact that if we ever want to change the helpdesk
[08/05/2007 02:36:07 PM] Alex Markov: the kb will need to be upgraded too
[08/05/2007 02:36:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is wrong with that?
[08/05/2007 02:36:24 PM] Alex Markov: well thatwill create 2 big tasks at once
[08/05/2007 02:36:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should get software that is specific to just a KB then
[08/05/2007 02:36:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: because cerberus is supposed to be both
[08/05/2007 02:36:47 PM] Alex Markov: yes we will discuss it
[08/05/2007 02:36:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it works together nicely
[08/05/2007 02:36:53 PM] Alex Markov: i personally hate cerberus
[08/05/2007 02:36:57 PM] Alex Markov: but continue with other tasks
[08/05/2007 02:37:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might have made a break through in the paypal thing
[08/05/2007 02:37:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: the problem was trying to find a field that i could search for, AND specify in the order, AND have it show up in the details
[08/05/2007 02:37:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: all 3 of those things had to have a field in common
[08/05/2007 02:39:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck paypal is being slow today
[08/05/2007 02:41:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i finally found a field that i can use in all 3 places, and thats the invoice number, so i figured it out by spending hours reading documentation and now i've finally started to implement it, and paypal is crapping out on me
[08/05/2007 02:41:22 PM] Alex Markov: :(
[08/05/2007 02:42:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: so while i'm waiting for that, will you answer my question about the leads protocol
[08/05/2007 02:42:50 PM] Alex Markov: do what u think is best

[08/05/2007 02:44:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/05/2007 02:44:11 PM] Alex Markov: that is outdated
[08/05/2007 02:44:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought that is the one we are going off of
[08/05/2007 02:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so just use the individual posts?
[08/05/2007 02:44:31 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[08/05/2007 02:44:37 PM] Alex Markov: i beleive it is outdated. im not 100% sure

[08/07/2007 10:43:41 AM] Alex Markov: dont get mad. just do it
[08/07/2007 10:44:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did do it so it must not be showing up right
[08/07/2007 10:44:07 AM] Alex Markov: if i know NOTHING about SVN... and i look at this forum: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129

[08/07/2007 10:44:30 AM] Alex Markov: make a SVN overview post
[08/07/2007 10:44:33 AM] Alex Markov: with links to the other posts
[08/07/2007 10:44:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude if you know nothing about svn then the font size of the header is not going to fucking matter
[08/07/2007 10:45:04 AM] Alex Markov: its not finished
[08/07/2007 10:45:41 AM] Alex Markov: all protocols need to have the style. whats it gonnat ake u. 10 minutes? stop complaining. 
[08/07/2007 10:46:01 AM] Alex Markov: im driving 8 hours tomorow for RPS
[08/07/2007 10:46:11 AM] Alex Markov: we just do what we gotta do
[08/07/2007 10:46:14 AM] Alex Markov: no complaining
[08/07/2007 10:46:16 AM] Alex Markov: no excuses
[08/07/2007 10:46:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is a pain in the ass
[08/07/2007 10:46:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: and completely unnessiary
[08/07/2007 10:46:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: why did you put the same name of the thread into the post?
[08/07/2007 10:46:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: that its completely redundant

[08/07/2007 10:46:52 AM] Alex Markov: this is the way a protocol should look
[08/07/2007 10:47:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah if it were in a documents
[08/07/2007 10:47:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: why dont i just make it an attachment
[08/07/2007 10:47:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you can download the entire document
[08/07/2007 10:47:51 AM] Alex Markov: because it need sto look right
[08/07/2007 10:47:57 AM] Alex Markov: if it has no style
[08/07/2007 10:48:04 AM] Alex Markov: it looks just a big block of text
[08/07/2007 10:48:37 AM] Alex Markov: make the SVN protocols look just liekt his

[08/07/2007 10:49:17 AM] Alex Markov: i have repeated it like 10 tiems
[08/07/2007 10:49:24 AM] Alex Markov: u have literally disregarded what i said
[08/07/2007 10:50:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: what are you talking about?
[08/07/2007 10:51:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't even save half this shit because of the fucking shitty ass security that robert has installed
[08/07/2007 10:51:15 AM] Alex Markov: the thing about the style has been in many emails i sent u regarding SVN
[08/07/2007 10:51:36 AM] Alex Markov: dont jsut disregard something ebcause its a pain in the ass
[08/07/2007 10:51:50 AM] Alex Markov: all protocols will have the style and will be laid out very pretty. thats it
[08/07/2007 10:52:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah e-mail you sent did match the information that needed to be display
[08/07/2007 10:52:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: ed
[08/07/2007 10:52:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: so you are right i did disregard that
[08/07/2007 10:52:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the style is still there
[08/07/2007 10:52:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i have no idea what you are referring to
[08/07/2007 10:52:40 AM] Alex Markov: dont ever disregard. that is rude. i would never disregard a request from you. no matter how small it is

[08/07/2007 10:53:01 AM] Alex Markov: it doesnt matter now. all that matters is u make all svn prots look like that
[08/07/2007 10:53:03 AM] Alex Markov: thats it
[08/07/2007 10:53:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i divided mine up just like you did
[08/07/2007 10:53:14 AM] Alex Markov: and make a SVN overview post which explains the SVN system and links to the posts
[08/07/2007 10:53:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know why you keep senting me that link
[08/07/2007 10:53:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i disregarded it because you told me to write the protocol
[08/07/2007 10:53:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you want to write it instead?
[08/07/2007 10:54:05 AM] Alex Markov: look at the code for that post and ur post

[08/07/2007 10:54:09 AM] Alex Markov: u used different formatting
[08/07/2007 10:54:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: because your code doesn't support listing numbers
[08/07/2007 10:54:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: those are the steps
[08/07/2007 10:54:45 AM] Alex Markov: dont put steps into ordered lists
[08/07/2007 10:54:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: they don't require any other explanation underneath them
[08/07/2007 10:54:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: that doesn't make any sense
[08/07/2007 10:54:58 AM] Alex Markov: make them big and have h2
[08/07/2007 10:55:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: they don't require extra information
[08/07/2007 10:55:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: they are simply just an order of directions
[08/07/2007 10:55:23 AM] Alex Markov: brian i dont have time to argue with u. i have to go to meeting in 4 hours
[08/07/2007 10:55:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok fine you have it your way, but it will still look like shit
[08/07/2007 10:55:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: and its because you can't apply the same damn format to every situation
[08/07/2007 10:55:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: you have to adapt something new
[08/07/2007 10:56:00 AM] Alex Markov: study the way that leads psot is made
[08/07/2007 10:56:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i will redo it your way
[08/07/2007 10:56:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you will see that it looks ridiculous
[08/07/2007 10:56:15 AM] Alex Markov: the format will be used for ALL official protocols
[08/07/2007 10:56:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: neg
[08/07/2007 10:56:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need a modfication to the format then
[08/07/2007 10:56:32 AM] Alex Markov: we can discuss that later
[08/07/2007 10:56:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: because it doesn't handle ordered steps
[08/07/2007 10:56:39 AM] Alex Markov: but put everything in that format
[08/07/2007 10:56:54 AM] Alex Markov: make the SVN protocols so easy to udnerstand that i will have no question
[08/07/2007 10:56:56 AM] Alex Markov: s
[08/07/2007 10:57:02 AM] Alex Markov: and a new employee will have no questions
[08/07/2007 10:57:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: is that what you want?
[08/07/2007 10:57:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=154)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/showthread.php?t=154

[08/07/2007 10:57:25 AM] Alex Markov: what is ADMIN
[08/07/2007 10:57:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: that looks retarded
[08/07/2007 10:57:26 AM] Alex Markov: use google
[08/07/2007 10:57:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: why is there a space in between each step?
[08/07/2007 10:57:50 AM] Alex Markov: its the way it is
[08/07/2007 10:57:50 AM] Alex Markov:  
3. Pick your Repo
[08/07/2007 10:57:52 AM] Alex Markov: what is repo
[08/07/2007 10:58:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: repository
[08/07/2007 10:58:06 AM] Alex Markov: brian. go through this. make sure it is fully polished. take the time
[08/07/2007 10:58:10 AM] Alex Markov: spell it out
[08/07/2007 10:58:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is
[08/07/2007 10:58:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i spent days planning it out
[08/07/2007 10:58:32 AM] Alex Markov: and make a general overview post to describe what each post is for
[08/07/2007 10:58:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: and to find out what a repo is, visit the Select your repo post
[08/07/2007 10:58:40 AM] Alex Markov: yes.. i am sure it is well planned. now polish it
[08/07/2007 10:58:51 AM] Alex Markov: then put a link
[08/07/2007 10:59:06 AM] Alex Markov: go through it 100 times if need be
[08/07/2007 10:59:16 AM] Alex Markov: focus. and do it. get this done by end of dasy
[08/07/2007 10:59:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok there is a link
[08/07/2007 10:59:17 AM] Alex Markov: brb
[08/07/2007 10:59:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am done
[08/07/2007 11:00:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the big ass text and spacing for an ordered list looks retarded
[08/07/2007 11:00:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: and if i were a new employee i would look at it and be like WTF? am i missing something?
[08/07/2007 11:00:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: those look like headers not steps?
[08/07/2007 11:06:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: how do you and robert always manage to put me in a bad mood right when a wake up
[08/07/2007 11:07:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: all this nit picky stuff really doesn't matter on the larger scale
[08/07/2007 11:07:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: we still have clients that don't pay us because of missing part of the contract
[08/07/2007 11:07:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: and all you can do is complain about the font size in the posts
[08/07/2007 11:08:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: its not that i hate working, its that this kind of shit annoys the hell out of me
[08/07/2007 11:08:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: all the required information is there, thats the important part
[08/07/2007 11:09:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't want morons working for us, everyone should take their own time to learn to use software to its fullest extent
[08/07/2007 11:09:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: there is no way that i could possibly document every capability for the software
[08/07/2007 11:09:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: they are just going to have to rtfm
[08/07/2007 11:10:23 AM] Alex Markov: stop fighting against everything. u dont think that puts me in a bad mood. when there is something to be done and u do it half assed and disregard specific instructions. and regarding annouying things to do. dont even get me started on annouying shit. EVERY BUSINESS HAS ANNOUYING FUNCTIONS THAT ARE A NECCESSITY AND JSUT NEED TO GET DONE. thats it.
[08/07/2007 11:10:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i just don't understand why the font is so important
[08/07/2007 11:11:20 AM] Alex Markov: u need to be able to look at a protocol and see exactly what to do in big font
[08/07/2007 11:11:48 AM] Alex Markov: thepoint is u dont need to understand why something is important. the point is if it needs to get done just do it
[08/07/2007 11:12:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i had it all worked out and formatted nicely in OneNote, it looked twice as good as it does now, and it matched your format and better, but there is no way for me to get the html code from onenote
[08/07/2007 11:12:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need to modify the format to support numbered lists
[08/07/2007 11:12:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats my biggest issue here
[08/07/2007 11:12:34 AM] Alex Markov: i did too with leads protocol. but i took theextra 30 minutes to lay itout right
[08/07/2007 11:12:44 AM] Alex Markov: we will modify the format later
[08/07/2007 11:12:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i can talk to robert to do it if i need to, its not a hugae change
[08/07/2007 11:12:56 AM] Alex Markov: do what needs to be done
[08/07/2007 11:13:23 AM] Alex Markov: but this SVN forum needs to compeltely and utterly be finished by the end of today
[08/07/2007 11:13:25 AM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=129
[08/07/2007 11:13:34 AM] Alex Markov: make a general psot to introduce SVN
[08/07/2007 11:16:43 AM] Alex Markov: make the protocols so fucking polished that i have literally ZERO comments. anything that i can possibly comments on... fix. make it so a complete idiot can understand
[08/07/2007 11:16:48 AM] Alex Markov: i am gonna check this in 8 hours
[08/07/2007 11:17:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know what else to do
[08/07/2007 11:17:57 AM] Alex Markov: im not gonna micromanage this. go through each post. i can see things left and right i will comment on
[08/07/2007 11:18:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see anything wrong with it
[08/07/2007 11:18:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have all the windows open
[08/07/2007 11:19:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: why does your post use little - dashes
[08/07/2007 11:19:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i had before
[08/07/2007 11:19:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: you have a list in the format
[08/07/2007 11:19:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: you should have use UL and LI
[08/07/2007 11:19:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: and at the top of your post there is a dash and then a space
[08/07/2007 11:20:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: when the rest of them just have a dash and then the text
[08/07/2007 11:20:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: no space
[08/07/2007 11:20:32 AM] Alex Markov: propose a better style for forum posts then if u are not satisfied with current style
[08/07/2007 11:20:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: all i am saying is its not going to be perfect
[08/07/2007 11:21:10 AM] Alex Markov: brian. i am reading this... and i have questions left and right. go rea dit urself and pretend u know nothing about SVN
[08/07/2007 11:21:14 AM] Alex Markov: in 8 hours im gonan check this
[08/07/2007 11:21:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: if we want it official we should have a different type of document like a PDF attached to each version, the forum is for commenting and proposing changed to it
[08/07/2007 11:21:45 AM] Alex Markov: if there is not an overview post and it matches the way our leads protocols work i will be highly disappointed
[08/07/2007 11:22:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: its not going to be perfect when its in the forum, and i am just one person when we get 30 people posting in our forum there is no way you can manage the format for all of that
[08/07/2007 11:22:45 AM] Alex Markov: the forum is too look at a protocols and knwo exactly what is what. 
[08/07/2007 11:22:50 AM] Alex Markov: all protocols will have same style
[08/07/2007 11:23:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you want a perfect standardized format it should be written up in word and converted to a PDF

[08/07/2007 11:25:18 AM] Alex Markov: Step title in h2 
step description not in h2
[08/07/2007 11:25:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: why did you change it, all that information was there
[08/07/2007 11:25:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: in a different arrangement
[08/07/2007 11:25:38 AM] Alex Markov: because u dont need specific instructions in step title
[08/07/2007 11:25:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: its not a step title
[08/07/2007 11:25:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: its a step
[08/07/2007 11:25:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: that you made me change into a title

[08/10/2007 01:38:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i too am waiting for an update on why the admins having fixed this problem yet, i told robert to send them another e-mail
[08/10/2007 01:39:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i uploaded stuff into the SVN
[08/10/2007 01:39:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and found another problem with the configuration
[08/10/2007 01:39:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: something that i would be able to fix if i had admin access
[08/10/2007 01:39:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i called robert back after he called me and he didn't answer
[08/10/2007 01:39:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took a shower and took a shit today too
[08/10/2007 01:40:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and went to the bank to deposit a check for rent from my roommate
[08/10/2007 01:40:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to reconfigure the SVN, and be able to test to make sure it works
[08/10/2007 01:42:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know what else to do
[08/10/2007 01:42:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't do what i need to do because robert has some superiority complex and won't hand over the admin username and password or return my phone calls
[08/10/2007 01:43:19 PM] Alex Markov: robert has been busy all day in meeting and such. 
[08/10/2007 01:43:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i'm going to go make a samich
[08/10/2007 01:43:32 PM] Alex Markov: sec
[08/10/2007 01:43:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: a big juicy peppered turkey samich
[08/10/2007 01:44:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then i'm going to enjoy it thoroughly, and ponder on the next steps for jambonie, and whatever else i can do for this company
[08/10/2007 01:44:26 PM] Alex Markov: i know ur probably tired of hearing things like this. but just listen. u need to start acting more like a partner. what i mean by that is. u should never have "nothing else to do"
[08/10/2007 01:44:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't know what to do
[08/10/2007 01:45:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i do have something to do, but i can't figure out what it is on my own
[08/10/2007 01:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys are managers, i haven't managed a project yet, i am sure that if i had an internship and became a PM, i would have a lot to do
[08/10/2007 01:45:40 PM] Alex Markov: here is something. do u haveadmin access to rps forums?
[08/10/2007 01:45:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but shit like not having an admin password to reconfigure something is really standing in my way
[08/10/2007 01:46:02 PM] Alex Markov: ok i will try to keep u more abreast of ongoing things so u can have an opportunity to pitch in more
[08/10/2007 01:46:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be nice
[08/10/2007 01:46:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do have admin access yes
[08/10/2007 01:46:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: finally ( to the forums that is )
[08/10/2007 01:46:36 PM] Alex Markov: make a forum for jambonie staff
[08/10/2007 01:46:39 PM] Alex Markov: under rps forums
[08/10/2007 01:46:58 PM] Alex Markov: and make the permissions so that only jambonie users and RPS staff can access it
[08/10/2007 01:47:22 PM] Alex Markov: we need a forum in which to discuss things with marc and randy
[08/10/2007 01:47:59 PM] Alex Markov: but marc and randy should not be able to have access to rps forums. only that jambonie forum
[08/10/2007 01:48:04 PM] Alex Markov: its been on my list for a week
[08/10/2007 01:49:19 PM] Alex Markov: next... after u figure that out
[08/10/2007 01:49:26 PM] Alex Markov: we need to install the sugar kb and customer portal
[08/10/2007 01:50:18 PM] Alex Markov: u mentioned u did not know how to do it. well somewhere there has to be instructions. find them and install them
[08/10/2007 01:50:28 PM] Alex Markov: this will give u good practice with sugar too
[08/10/2007 01:50:37 PM] Alex Markov: because we are going to start selling sugar soon
[08/10/2007 01:51:34 PM] Alex Markov: the files for the kb and customer portal are in the sugar download area. information for that is in pmxp under opm db
[08/10/2007 01:53:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/10/2007 01:54:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: this samich is so good
[08/10/2007 01:55:13 PM] Alex Markov: :)
[08/10/2007 01:55:19 PM] Alex Markov: Alex sent you a wink which requires the latest version of Windows Live Messenger. To download the latest version of Windows Live Messenger, go to (Link: http://g.msn.com/5meen_us/122.)http://g.msn.com/5meen_us/122.

[08/10/2007 02:01:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: see i can do these tasks if you just let me know what needs to be done
[08/10/2007 02:01:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not a business major, i know what the company should eventually be, but how to get there is foggy for me
[08/10/2007 02:02:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=106)http://www.rp-s.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=106
[08/10/2007 02:04:52 PM] Alex Markov: :) ok so we will work together and figure it out
[08/10/2007 02:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i'll make one in there for jambonie staff
[08/10/2007 02:05:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be logical
[08/10/2007 02:05:38 PM] Alex Markov: well that is our internal client forum
[08/10/2007 02:05:49 PM] Alex Markov: if u can put the internal jambonie staff forum in there... then thats good

[08/10/2007 02:10:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: can you give me a name of one of the jambonie staff members that will be using this so i can mess around with permissions?
[08/10/2007 02:19:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: looks like that'll work

[08/10/2007 03:02:21 PM] Alex Markov: there has to be a way to set it up so only certain uses can see and access certain forums

[08/10/2007 03:19:53 PM] Alex Markov: np
[08/10/2007 03:19:56 PM] Alex Markov: brb
[08/10/2007 03:20:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: fixed
[08/10/2007 03:24:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am still confused as to this KB issue
[08/10/2007 03:24:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: why are you worried about having to update the KB when you update the helpdesk?
[08/10/2007 03:24:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: that doesn't make any sense
[08/10/2007 03:24:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: like it is going to crash?
[08/10/2007 03:25:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you'd rather try out the Sugar KB?
[08/10/2007 03:25:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: what happens when we have to update Sugar?
[08/10/2007 03:30:52 PM] Alex Markov: well we are not gonna leave sugar
[08/10/2007 03:30:57 PM] Alex Markov: we are with sugar for the long haul
[08/10/2007 03:31:01 PM] Alex Markov: but cerberus we gonna get rid of soon
[08/10/2007 03:31:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck its a good thing i have a lot of gin
[08/10/2007 03:31:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying we should leave sugar
[08/10/2007 03:31:27 PM] Alex Markov: we dont want to build up the kb in cerberus... and then get rid of it... and then have to transfer all that knwoledge somewhere else
[08/10/2007 03:31:36 PM] Alex Markov: that will be a bitch of a transfer
[08/10/2007 03:31:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are leaving cerberus then i agree with you entirely, we should use a different KB software
[08/10/2007 03:31:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is news to me
[08/10/2007 03:31:54 PM] Alex Markov: the cerberus version we have is discontinued
[08/10/2007 03:32:03 PM] Alex Markov: new versions are on a lease type thing
[08/10/2007 03:32:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had no idea up until now that we planned to leave cerberus
[08/10/2007 03:32:09 PM] Alex Markov: where we pay per user
[08/10/2007 03:32:11 PM] Alex Markov: its rly expensive
[08/10/2007 03:32:14 PM] Alex Markov: and not worth it
[08/10/2007 03:32:30 PM] Alex Markov: until we have thousands of clients and a full support staff
[08/10/2007 03:32:36 PM] Alex Markov: sugar has this new knowledgebase
[08/10/2007 03:32:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok then i will install that
[08/10/2007 03:32:50 PM] Alex Markov: and it has ability to make an article internal or external (client accesible)
[08/10/2007 03:32:53 PM] Alex Markov: we should look into it
[08/10/2007 03:32:56 PM] Alex Markov: install customer portal first
[08/10/2007 03:33:01 PM] Alex Markov: the kb feeds into customer portal
[08/10/2007 03:33:10 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: http://www.rp-s.com/new.php)http://www.rp-s.com/new.php
[08/10/2007 03:33:20 PM] Alex Markov: the login box in top right will log a customer into the customer portal
[08/10/2007 03:33:28 PM] Alex Markov: where they can do alot of things
[08/10/2007 03:33:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: customer portal is kind of like a help desk?
[08/10/2007 03:33:33 PM] Alex Markov: but we need to isntall it and check it out
[08/10/2007 03:33:38 PM] Alex Markov: its like a customer center
[08/10/2007 03:33:54 PM] Alex Markov: they can look through knowledgebase... and submit information. and even approve various project elements
[08/10/2007 03:34:04 PM] Alex Markov: like they can see the status of their projects
[08/10/2007 03:34:19 PM] Alex Markov: and sugar has big and crazy plans for it in version 5.0 and 5.5 and 6.0
[08/10/2007 03:34:40 PM] Alex Markov: and since our clients are alreayd in sugar... they will automatically get a username and password created
[08/10/2007 03:34:51 PM] Alex Markov: clients can also update their contact info which will feed into sugar automatically
[08/10/2007 03:34:56 PM] Alex Markov: it has ALOT of potential
[08/10/2007 03:35:01 PM] Alex Markov: be back in a little bit
[08/10/2007 03:36:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: hot
[08/10/2007 03:36:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can edit documents page
[08/10/2007 03:36:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we can still use documents to record SVN changes, and just put a link in it instead of an actual file
[08/10/2007 03:40:04 PM] Alex Markov: keep this in mind too...think of sugar addons we can make and sell to other sugar users
[08/10/2007 03:40:13 PM] Alex Markov: in general
[08/10/2007 03:40:19 PM] Alex Markov: ok install customer portal and kb
[08/10/2007 03:40:20 PM] Alex Markov: i brb
[08/10/2007 03:53:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know where to find customer portal
[08/10/2007 03:53:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it called sugar portal?
[08/10/2007 04:00:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i'm tired
[08/10/2007 04:08:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to go drink some gin to numb the pain
[08/10/2007 04:10:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck thats nasty
[08/10/2007 04:10:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: water doesn't make a good chaser

[08/12/2007 01:26:14 PM] Alex Markov: wack
[08/12/2007 01:26:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert must have changed some code
[08/12/2007 01:27:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: because they showed up as "categories" is what it is called, and they were showing correctly, but everyone could see them, then when i changed them back to forums so they had the right permissions, they didn't display properly
[08/12/2007 01:27:31 PM] Alex Markov: ack

[08/13/2007 02:25:33 PM] Alex Markov: i think unlimited or something
[08/13/2007 02:26:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: SugarPortal is a portal framework that provides a self-service portal, which allows 
 your users and contacts to view, create, and edit cases and bugs in Sugar Suite.
[08/13/2007 02:27:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: does that mean bugs only related to the sugar suite?
[08/13/2007 02:27:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: why would we need that?
[08/13/2007 02:27:46 PM] Alex Markov: no sugar has a whole big bug thing
[08/13/2007 02:27:50 PM] Alex Markov: its kinda like a helpdesk

[08/13/2007 05:19:48 PM] Alex Markov: first and foremost. i am not sure i this is even a problem but i would like to atleast talk about it. u mentioned a few times that you drink. like i said, i dont know the situation because im not there. however, it does not make me feel very good
[08/13/2007 05:20:29 PM] Alex Markov: i known alot of people who drank little here and there and slowly escalated until it changed them
[08/13/2007 05:20:37 PM] Alex Markov: some are completely shot
[08/13/2007 05:21:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, we don't need to discuss this topic
[08/13/2007 05:21:29 PM] Alex Markov: furthermore. we need to stay focused and only when we are focused. we will create such an amazing company
[08/13/2007 05:21:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i do appreciate your concern
[08/13/2007 05:21:41 PM] Alex Markov: i only bring it up because i strongly value your involvement with us
[08/13/2007 05:21:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and has any drinking that i've done on my own time affected that?
[08/13/2007 05:22:43 PM] Alex Markov: no. but it can creep up on anyone
[08/13/2007 05:22:54 PM] Alex Markov: even the best and smartest of people
[08/13/2007 05:23:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love beer, but i'm also not an idiot, i promise you nothing bad will come of me having a beer once in a while
[08/13/2007 05:23:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not even a habit yet
[08/13/2007 05:23:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: let alone a bad one
[08/13/2007 05:23:56 PM] Alex Markov: we will only be the best if we are all working to the best of our abilities and fully focused. so i just thought i would atleast throw it out there
[08/13/2007 05:24:00 PM] Alex Markov: agreed

[08/13/2007 05:24:56 PM] Alex Markov: next
[08/13/2007 05:25:10 PM] Alex Markov: i need you to mail me some of your current business cards
[08/13/2007 05:25:17 PM] Alex Markov: so i can see the paper quality. 
[08/13/2007 05:25:39 PM] Alex Markov: so when we order u new ones, i can make the best decision as to which paper stock to order
[08/13/2007 05:25:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah should i use the address on the card?
[08/13/2007 05:25:47 PM] Alex Markov: yes

[08/13/2007 05:29:42 PM] Alex Markov: cue splitter is a program alot of people use for that
[08/13/2007 05:29:45 PM] Alex Markov: works pretty well
[08/13/2007 05:31:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: can you split mp3s?
[08/13/2007 05:31:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: not just cue?
[08/13/2007 05:31:51 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[08/13/2007 05:31:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it free?
[08/13/2007 05:32:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: not trial crap?
[08/13/2007 05:32:54 PM] Alex Markov: not sure
[08/13/2007 05:33:08 PM] Alex Markov: read up on it. from my memory it was free
[08/13/2007 05:35:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: says it needs a cue file
[08/13/2007 05:37:24 PM] Alex Markov: i dont know. i split up a big mp3 into smaller ones before
[08/13/2007 05:44:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: sonar can do it
[08/13/2007 05:44:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: hotness
[08/13/2007 05:44:54 PM] Alex Markov: i just emailed out new policy i am instituting

[08/13/2007 05:56:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 05:56:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[08/13/2007 05:57:06 PM] Alex Markov: did u read it yet?
[08/13/2007 05:57:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/13/2007 05:57:42 PM] Alex Markov: song rly badass lol
[08/13/2007 05:57:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/13/2007 05:58:06 PM] Alex Markov: it is a really important policy because this whole working late is not good
[08/13/2007 05:58:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: k
[08/13/2007 05:58:53 PM] Alex Markov: its not good because 1. late afternoon and evening is when most things happen, such as good tv, social functions, and time spent with family and friends. work should not encroach in this time
[08/13/2007 05:59:03 PM] Alex Markov: sometimes we will work late. but it should not be the norm
[08/13/2007 05:59:37 PM] Alex Markov: 2. if we want to work with clients, we need to work based on their business hours. and we need to be comfortable with it. we need to get into the habit NOW before we start working on clients full time
[08/13/2007 06:00:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[08/13/2007 06:00:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: its just hard when robert and I are up debugging at 12 at night
[08/13/2007 06:00:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i agree
[08/13/2007 06:00:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when school starts i'll have an even stricter schedule
[08/13/2007 06:00:54 PM] Alex Markov: i know. but we need to get out of this schedule
[08/13/2007 06:01:07 PM] Alex Markov: when school starts the schedules for school attending staff will be amended
[08/13/2007 06:01:26 PM] Alex Markov: this policy applies to me too. it is much easier to follow somethign when there is a strict policy
[08/13/2007 06:02:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/13/2007 06:03:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: my roommate was not impressed with my ring tone
[08/13/2007 06:03:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i worked so hard on it
[08/13/2007 06:03:24 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[08/13/2007 06:03:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: bastard isn't amused by anything
[08/13/2007 06:03:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: hes so much more fun when he drinks
[08/13/2007 06:10:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: if there is anything that will drive me to alcoholism it will be an antisocial roommate
[08/13/2007 06:10:30 PM] Alex Markov: hehe
[08/13/2007 06:10:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: usually when i am around computer people we are always talking about cool stuff
[08/13/2007 06:10:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: he hardly even speaks to me
[08/13/2007 06:11:24 PM] Alex Markov: dont worry. ive had some shitting roomates in the past
[08/13/2007 06:11:46 PM] Alex Markov: its a small uncomfortable siutaiton that will go away soon
[08/13/2007 06:11:50 PM] Alex Markov: dont let it bother u
[08/13/2007 06:12:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, i think its just him, i don't think he wants to talk to me
[08/13/2007 06:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[08/13/2007 06:12:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i had the recovery CD for my laptop sent to the wrong address

[08/14/2007 02:25:32 PM] Alex Markov: did u figure out how to log into it?
[08/14/2007 02:25:38 PM] Alex Markov: find a login name for client
[08/14/2007 02:25:52 PM] Alex Markov: and letslogin and play with it
[08/14/2007 02:26:03 PM] Alex Markov: and install kb so we can see it in action too
[08/14/2007 02:26:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: no documentation on KB
[08/14/2007 02:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: might take me a while
[08/14/2007 02:27:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: The system converts SugarPortal registrants into leads in Sugar Suite. You must send 
 every registrant a unique user name and password to log into SugarPortal.
[08/14/2007 02:27:15 PM] Alex Markov: k i believe in you. i am positive u will be able to figure it out
[08/14/2007 02:27:30 PM] Alex Markov: how do we create the usernames and passwords
[08/14/2007 02:27:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: robert says he doesn't want to use sugar KB
[08/14/2007 02:27:38 PM] Alex Markov: i want to see it still
[08/14/2007 02:27:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: he needs to get that sand out of his vagina
[08/14/2007 02:27:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: go ahead and register yourself
[08/14/2007 02:28:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: just use alex for the username
[08/14/2007 02:30:16 PM] Alex Markov: done
[08/14/2007 02:35:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i just reconfigure it with the portal extension
[08/14/2007 02:36:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: stop using portal for a sec
[08/14/2007 02:37:22 PM] Alex Markov: k
[08/14/2007 02:44:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok log in again
[08/14/2007 02:59:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i sure wish this fucking thing came with a readme file
[08/14/2007 02:59:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats just bad programming

[08/14/2007 03:35:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: hi
[08/14/2007 03:38:13 PM] Alex Markov: username and pass
[08/14/2007 03:38:15 PM] Alex Markov: for portal
[08/14/2007 03:38:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2007 03:38:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about it?
[08/14/2007 03:38:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought you created one?
[08/14/2007 03:39:18 PM] Alex Markov: i did but it did not give me user and pass
[08/14/2007 03:41:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: should have e-mailed it to you
[08/14/2007 03:41:31 PM] Alex Markov: no email
[08/14/2007 03:52:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: To ensure that your contacts can successfully use SugarPortal, create a contact 
 in Sugar Suite as a portal-only user and log into SugarPortal with the portal 
 username and password.
[08/14/2007 03:52:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is the missing link
[08/14/2007 03:52:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no password and username options for contacts
[08/14/2007 03:53:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: this portal thing sucks
[08/14/2007 03:59:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah this shit doesn't work at all
[08/14/2007 04:03:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i followed their tutorial step by step and it doesn't work
[08/14/2007 04:03:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the KB doesn't even have installation information
[08/14/2007 04:03:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking gay
[08/14/2007 04:06:12 PM] Alex Markov: hey. you are smart. u can figure it out
[08/14/2007 04:06:19 PM] Alex Markov: search sugar forums
[08/14/2007 04:06:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude i've been trying to figure it out
[08/14/2007 04:06:28 PM] Alex Markov: or post on sugar forums

[08/14/2007 04:06:40 PM] Alex Markov: this is the contact it created
[08/14/2007 04:06:48 PM] Alex Markov: when i press edit i see a password
[08/14/2007 04:06:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that worked
[08/14/2007 04:06:51 PM] Alex Markov: it was randomized at first
[08/14/2007 04:06:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the only thing that worked
[08/14/2007 04:07:00 PM] Alex Markov: but i cant figure out the username
[08/14/2007 04:07:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: it actually created a lead and i converted it
[08/14/2007 04:07:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: from lead to contact
[08/14/2007 04:07:57 PM] Alex Markov: question is what is the username?
[08/14/2007 04:08:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i added portal password to the edit form
[08/14/2007 04:08:11 PM] Alex Markov: oh i see
[08/14/2007 04:08:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: it says portal application
[08/14/2007 04:08:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not a checkbox
[08/14/2007 04:08:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there is no portal username field
[08/14/2007 04:09:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: The system converts SugarPortal registrants into leads in Sugar Suite. You must send

[08/14/2007 04:09:18 PM] Alex Markov: that is fine
[08/14/2007 04:09:23 PM] Alex Markov: but where is the username created
[08/14/2007 04:10:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't say
[08/14/2007 04:10:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it says i have to do it
[08/14/2007 04:11:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there are no fields to do it

[08/15/2007 01:34:17 PM] Alex Markov: one of my friends was working for a corporate donald trump company but the company shut down so she doesn ahve a job
[08/15/2007 01:34:34 PM] Alex Markov: she said she is willing to work part time for $15 an hour
[08/15/2007 01:34:55 PM] Alex Markov: thats like to answer phones, file papers, prepare documents for my meetings, keep me organized, input data into sugar, send emails
[08/15/2007 01:35:14 PM] Alex Markov: for like $200 a week i can get much more organized
[08/15/2007 01:35:49 PM] Alex Markov: its a crazy proposition
[08/15/2007 01:35:59 PM] Alex Markov: she rly is sharp in terms of keeping things organized
[08/15/2007 01:36:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude what ever works
[08/15/2007 01:36:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you need help keeping organized you should do it
[08/15/2007 01:36:37 PM] Alex Markov: because i rly doo spend alot of time in a week on mundane things when i could be spending that time working with clients
[08/15/2007 01:36:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: it has made a huge difference in my dad's life having a secretary and an organizer
[08/15/2007 01:37:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely, and with our website going live soon we will have a lot more client activity
[08/15/2007 01:37:10 PM] Alex Markov: i should spend 100% of my time making rps money and not doing the bullshit shit i do on a daily basis
[08/15/2007 01:37:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/15/2007 01:37:19 PM] Alex Markov: i have liek 10 projects cooking
[08/15/2007 01:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: sweet good deal man
[08/15/2007 01:37:30 PM] Alex Markov: but i spent 3 hours today going through bullshit paper work and inputting shit into sugar
[08/15/2007 01:37:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes a nice woman then?
[08/15/2007 01:37:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone reliable?
[08/15/2007 01:38:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: easy on the eyes?
[08/15/2007 01:42:29 PM] Alex Markov: reliable yes
[08/15/2007 01:42:34 PM] Alex Markov: easyon the eyes somewhat
[08/15/2007 01:42:36 PM] Alex Markov: shes cute
[08/15/2007 01:42:45 PM] Alex Markov: ive known her for years. good friend
[08/15/2007 01:42:58 PM] Alex Markov: best friend of one of my best friend'
[08/15/2007 01:43:05 PM] Alex Markov: s girlfriend
[08/15/2007 01:43:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool cool good stuff
[08/15/2007 01:43:47 PM] Alex Markov: i dont know tho'
[08/15/2007 01:43:50 PM] Alex Markov: its somewhat of a risk
[08/15/2007 01:44:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: how so?
[08/15/2007 01:44:37 PM] Alex Markov: well because w edont have like an extra 800-1000 to spend on an office manager
[08/15/2007 01:44:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah good point
[08/15/2007 01:45:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you figure 3 hours per day is 15 hours per week
[08/15/2007 01:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats 225 dollars you could save of your own time per week
[08/15/2007 01:45:39 PM] Alex Markov: like we physically COULD cover it... but until the effeciency gains are seen it would be straining
[08/15/2007 01:45:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: 15*15
[08/15/2007 01:45:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/15/2007 01:46:10 PM] Alex Markov: i was thinking doing like 10-4 4 days a week.
[08/15/2007 01:46:38 PM] Alex Markov: thats 6 hours a day. at $15 an hour so thats $360 a week
[08/15/2007 01:46:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey i got my laptop working, so i need to finish setting that up then reinstall my desktop which will take significantly less time, and i will be back up and running at full speed
[08/15/2007 01:46:45 PM] Alex Markov: bah thats alot
[08/15/2007 01:46:52 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[08/15/2007 01:46:55 PM] Alex Markov: hurry
[08/15/2007 01:47:12 PM] Alex Markov: aso it wont jsut bring effeciency gains for me. it will for u guys too because she would be general office manager
[08/15/2007 01:47:19 PM] Alex Markov: so u guys can request her to do things
[08/15/2007 01:49:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that might be helpful
[08/15/2007 01:49:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know man 360 is a lot
[08/15/2007 01:49:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: my calculations couldn't top that
[08/15/2007 01:49:46 PM] Alex Markov: yeah it is i would probably start her off at lower than $15 an hour
[08/15/2007 01:49:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking a
[08/15/2007 01:49:52 PM] Alex Markov: and try to do like $200 per week

[08/15/2007 01:50:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was the one big difference i was looking forward to
[08/15/2007 01:51:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they ruined my hopes and dreams

[08/15/2007 03:02:36 PM] Alex Markov: k
[08/15/2007 03:04:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: as soon as i get a real linux computer set up I am so doing this answering machine thing
[08/15/2007 03:05:43 PM] Alex Markov: why
[08/15/2007 03:05:48 PM] Alex Markov: how does it differ from ur voicemail
[08/15/2007 03:06:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it records audio files
[08/15/2007 03:06:04 PM] Alex Markov: have u submitted case to sugar yet?
[08/15/2007 03:06:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: we don't have a home telephone number so nvm
[08/15/2007 03:06:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll submit the case now
[08/15/2007 03:06:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been working on my new laptop and making sure that all my configurations are backed up
[08/15/2007 03:07:00 PM] Alex Markov: brian come on. focus. u should have thought of submitting the case when u ran into the problem. i am not here to tell u how to do something
[08/15/2007 03:07:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: to reinstall on the desktop
[08/15/2007 03:07:08 PM] Alex Markov: im here to tell u what needs to be done
[08/15/2007 03:07:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude wtf is the big deal?

[08/15/2007 03:08:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't even know sugar had a forum until you mentioned it, i did submit the case to the forum so its not like i haven't put the issue out there
[08/15/2007 03:08:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i even modified the post to make it more clear
[08/15/2007 03:08:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: lets give it 24 hours in the forum, you can't expect results immediately
[08/15/2007 03:08:46 PM] Alex Markov: the big deal is i am here doing little tasks for rps al day and doing one thing after the next. and u lose focus and go research linux modems and things for yourself. its all irrelevant. it was 23 minutes since i told u how to submit a case. thats 23 minutes totally gone. 23 minutes here and there and before u know it thats 1 full work day a week that is wasted. 
[08/15/2007 03:08:53 PM] Alex Markov: do buth. forum and case

[08/15/2007 03:09:48 PM] Alex Markov: thats 23 minutes less likely that we will get a responce from sugar support today
[08/15/2007 03:09:55 PM] Alex Markov: we pay hundreds of dolalrs for their support. 
[08/15/2007 03:10:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is stuff that will make me more productive, like having a functional laptop
[08/15/2007 03:10:08 PM] Alex Markov: so that could have added a day on this task
[08/15/2007 03:10:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: or backing up configurations so i can reinstall windows
[08/15/2007 03:10:15 PM] Alex Markov: thats fine but u can multitask
[08/15/2007 03:10:32 PM] Alex Markov: windows is a bitch. often u need to just wait while things are loading or transfering ect
[08/15/2007 03:10:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[08/15/2007 03:10:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i reinstall windows about once a year
[08/15/2007 03:10:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i need to get it done before school starts
[08/15/2007 03:11:11 PM] Alex Markov: i understnd but u can multi task
[08/15/2007 03:11:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you are completely right, i have been working on stuff that benefits me
[08/15/2007 03:11:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you mentioned the phone system which i read over
[08/15/2007 03:11:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i took 5 minutes to search "linux answering machine" and found the first article
[08/15/2007 03:11:45 PM] Alex Markov: if we want this company to be a very well tuned engine. we must work on rps stuff during rps hours and then the stuff for yourself u can work on later
[08/15/2007 03:12:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: its something that i have always wanted to set up, but never found relevant results
[08/15/2007 03:12:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i did
[08/15/2007 03:12:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will proceed to bookmark it and save it for years down the road
[08/15/2007 03:12:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats also a negative
[08/15/2007 03:12:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: google gives their empoyees an entire work day to do personal research
[08/15/2007 03:13:15 PM] Alex Markov: lets say for example... if we do everything we need to do to get rps into fully functional mode. and lets say it takes 1 month. 5 mintues of bsing here and 5 minutes thee and 20 there and 5 there and before u know it instead of getting it up in 1 monht its 3 monhts
[08/15/2007 03:13:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you're mad because i take 5 minutes to look up something that may end up expanding my knowledge drastically in the future
[08/15/2007 03:13:37 PM] Alex Markov: im not mad. im just discussing
[08/15/2007 03:13:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i'm just saying, you can't put a price or time limit on knowledge
[08/15/2007 03:13:53 PM] Alex Markov: we are not google. google is corporate and their stock is $500 per share
[08/15/2007 03:14:15 PM] Alex Markov: we will have all the time in the world to research and expand knowledge later
[08/15/2007 03:14:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: no matter what it is, if i research something, it is increasing my knowledge, and no matter what it is, it could end up benefiting the company
[08/15/2007 03:15:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: the better i am at using linux to closer i will be to managing our servers, instead of paying hundreds of dollars per month on someone else to do it
[08/15/2007 03:15:24 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[08/15/2007 03:16:29 PM] Alex Markov: handle what needs to be done stratigicly. u have not bee handling this portal and kb setup in a smart manner. u are very smart. u should have figured out there were forums. and u know there is sugar support since we pay for it. come on bro. your potential is great
[08/15/2007 03:16:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: now you mentioned 25 minutes ago submitting the case to sugar support, i put the case in the forum, now i'm waiting to see if anyone else has similar issues, so you say 25 minutes less time to get a response, but i see it as 25 minutes more of finding a serious issue, 25 minutes closer to a full 24 hours in a forum
[08/15/2007 03:16:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't worry, it will get done
[08/15/2007 03:17:13 PM] Alex Markov: i should have told u to psot a case yesterday
[08/15/2007 03:17:19 PM] Alex Markov: AND forum
[08/15/2007 03:17:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just think it would be better if we used this time spent on the portal towards something more productive
[08/15/2007 03:17:31 PM] Alex Markov: i dont doubt u will. but it eneds to get done quicker so we can move on
[08/15/2007 03:18:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we should get the other KB i sent you a link to and start looking into that.  robert now says that might be too complicated, "we just need something simple", and thats after wanting to completely pick apart cerberus and reprogram it to use just the KB
[08/15/2007 03:18:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats ridiculous
[08/15/2007 03:18:45 PM] Alex Markov: agreed
[08/15/2007 03:19:01 PM] Alex Markov: let me decide what is more productive to spend time on. 
[08/15/2007 03:19:08 PM] Alex Markov: i have my reasons
[08/15/2007 03:19:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i'll let you decide, but the more you keep me in the loop the more tasks i have to do everyday
[08/15/2007 03:20:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i have a suggestion for the phone stuff
[08/15/2007 03:20:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you use the numbers 1 2 and 3
[08/15/2007 03:20:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats good to keep the listings short
[08/15/2007 03:21:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i have a question first, in the post you listed 1 existing clients
[08/15/2007 03:21:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it going to announce that?
[08/15/2007 03:21:13 PM] Alex Markov: no
[08/15/2007 03:21:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: then the client picks 1 or 2 for new clients?
[08/15/2007 03:21:26 PM] Alex Markov: yes
[08/15/2007 03:21:55 PM] Alex Markov: edited
[08/15/2007 03:21:56 PM] Alex Markov: look
[08/15/2007 03:22:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok so eventually we will have to modify it when we get more project managers?
[08/15/2007 03:22:41 PM] Alex Markov: well its very simple to modify
[08/15/2007 03:22:50 PM] Alex Markov: its all in an online admin area
[08/15/2007 03:23:03 PM] Alex Markov: but i think we will have a receptionist pick up all phones
[08/15/2007 03:23:07 PM] Alex Markov: and jsut write info
[08/15/2007 03:23:12 PM] Alex Markov: and the PMs will call them back
[08/15/2007 03:23:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah cool, or use Sugar to create information based on the type of call
[08/15/2007 03:23:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think we do need to add to the main menu, website support, and technical support
[08/15/2007 03:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: forward those to robert, then he can contact the right person based on the client inquiry
[08/15/2007 03:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i could to website and technical support too
[08/15/2007 03:24:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if the question goes over my head, i will ask for their name and number to call them back when i find the answer
[08/15/2007 03:25:03 PM] Alex Markov: hummm
[08/15/2007 03:25:13 PM] Alex Markov: ill talk about it with robert
[08/15/2007 03:25:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg, i just had this entirely spontaneous google query
[08/15/2007 03:25:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.sugarcrm.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21421)http://www.sugarcrm.com/forums/showthread.php?t=21421
[08/15/2007 03:25:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: sugar mobile
[08/15/2007 03:26:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be a fun project
[08/15/2007 03:26:35 PM] Alex Markov: (Link: https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/wireless/)https://www.rp-s.com/myrps/wireless/
[08/15/2007 03:26:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess that would be it
[08/15/2007 03:27:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats sweet thanks
[08/15/2007 03:28:13 PM] Alex Markov: oh yeah. u can use that to access sugar on ur phone
[08/15/2007 03:28:24 PM] Alex Markov: but u should sync all ur contacts into outlook using sugar sync
[08/15/2007 03:28:28 PM] Alex Markov: and that should sync into ur treo
[08/15/2007 03:29:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want all those contacts on my phone
[08/15/2007 03:29:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is too many
[08/15/2007 03:29:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it never worked for me
[08/15/2007 03:29:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: it only downloaded me, and no one else
[08/15/2007 03:29:42 PM] Alex Markov: i dont see a problem with amyncontacts
[08/15/2007 03:29:46 PM] Alex Markov: it jsut means all ur info is in one place
[08/15/2007 03:29:56 PM] Alex Markov: i have like 600 contacts in my phone with multiple #s for each
[08/15/2007 03:30:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll think about it
[08/15/2007 03:30:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i ever get it to work
[08/15/2007 03:30:29 PM] Alex Markov: k
[08/15/2007 03:30:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: and did you use get different folders in outlook to sync/
[08/15/2007 03:30:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[08/15/2007 03:30:42 PM] Alex Markov: no
[08/15/2007 03:30:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it only syncs the regular contacts folder
[08/15/2007 03:31:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: when the instructions for using sugar offline say to download to Business
[08/15/2007 03:31:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think
[08/15/2007 03:31:36 PM] Alex Markov: no
[08/15/2007 03:31:40 PM] Alex Markov: it syncs into regular
[08/15/2007 03:32:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/15/2007 03:33:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of request type would this be?
[08/15/2007 03:33:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: for the portal problem
[08/15/2007 03:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: nvm
[08/15/2007 03:39:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: why doesn't vbulletin show how many moderators are online
[08/15/2007 03:40:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: moderators are supposed to solve all my problems

[08/21/2007 12:47:22 PM] Alex Markov: and work on the other outstanding tasks
[08/21/2007 01:06:24 PM] Alex Markov: so we need robert to set it up on server?
[08/21/2007 01:06:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/21/2007 01:07:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: shit i keep making changes and saving over them
[08/21/2007 01:07:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: this would be so much cooler to use with svn
[08/21/2007 01:09:07 PM] Alex Markov: yep
[08/21/2007 01:09:47 PM] *** Alex Markov has received C:\Documents and Settings\Brian Cullinan\My Documents\My Company\BART. Gallery. PC 1.2.doc.
[08/21/2007 01:12:04 PM] Alex Markov: i am making changes 
[08/21/2007 01:12:13 PM] Alex Markov: i am putting sections on their own pages
[08/21/2007 01:12:21 PM] Alex Markov: and u dont ened to include prices for things included elsewhere
[08/21/2007 01:45:36 PM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "BART. Gallery. PC 1.4.doc"
[08/21/2007 01:45:47 PM] Alex Markov: i made a bunch of changes
[08/21/2007 01:45:54 PM] Alex Markov: i think this will be very simple and very effective
[08/21/2007 01:45:59 PM] Alex Markov: the whole gallery will be on one page
[08/21/2007 01:46:05 PM] Alex Markov: the images willnot have descriptions
[08/21/2007 01:46:10 PM] Alex Markov: and will just have an order button underneith
[08/21/2007 01:46:17 PM] Alex Markov: so describe the gallery in detail
[08/21/2007 01:46:20 PM] Alex Markov: features and stuff
[08/21/2007 01:46:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you just said don't do half the features
[08/21/2007 01:46:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've already got them implemented
[08/21/2007 01:46:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: in the ffz code
[08/21/2007 01:48:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow dude, you removed like everything i wrote
[08/21/2007 01:51:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand, what am i supposed to add?
[08/21/2007 01:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want me to write this "escription of how client will login and upload a picture and what the gallery will automatically do."
[08/21/2007 01:51:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had that all written and you erased it
[08/21/2007 02:08:32 PM] Alex Markov:  yeah it was talking about features we dont rly need
[08/21/2007 02:08:51 PM] Alex Markov: just explain that it will automatically resize and optimize pictures
[08/21/2007 02:08:57 PM] Alex Markov: of artworks
[08/21/2007 02:09:07 PM] Alex Markov: and load them on the website
[08/21/2007 02:09:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i explained it in more detail, you deleted it all
[08/21/2007 02:10:06 PM] Alex Markov: i shouldnt cut it all sry
[08/21/2007 02:10:10 PM] Alex Markov: we dont need categories
[08/21/2007 02:10:20 PM] Alex Markov: we dont need long and short descriptions
[08/21/2007 02:10:24 PM] Alex Markov: we dont need any
[08/21/2007 02:10:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: so no descriptions?
[08/21/2007 02:10:40 PM] Alex Markov: we willnot specify size of thumbnails
[08/21/2007 02:10:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: why not? what if client wants descriptions?
[08/21/2007 02:10:56 PM] Alex Markov: he doesnt
[08/21/2007 02:11:02 PM] Alex Markov: if he wants them we will add it later
[08/21/2007 02:11:06 PM] Alex Markov: he wont want descriptions
[08/21/2007 02:11:32 PM] Alex Markov: this project is a bit weird because u did not start talking to client
[08/21/2007 02:11:48 PM] Alex Markov: we need to make it as cheap as possible
[08/21/2007 02:11:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/21/2007 02:12:16 PM] Alex Markov: he will not control or customize intro/welcome text
[08/21/2007 02:12:27 PM] Alex Markov: we will create one version o it and it may change a few words here and there
[08/21/2007 02:12:34 PM] Alex Markov: over next few years
[08/21/2007 02:12:40 PM] Alex Markov: it will just be a simple paragraph
[08/21/2007 02:12:42 PM] Alex Markov: static
[08/21/2007 02:13:06 PM] Alex Markov: just have imagemagik resize and optimize the pictures when they get uploaded
[08/21/2007 02:13:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/21/2007 02:13:37 PM] Alex Markov: a 1 page template and logo we will pay designer to do as combo for like $250
[08/21/2007 02:13:46 PM] Alex Markov: and then u will get paid $200 for the simple script
[08/21/2007 02:13:55 PM] Alex Markov: and then we charge client $900
[08/21/2007 02:14:01 PM] Alex Markov: so we have $550 profit
[08/21/2007 02:14:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/21/2007 02:14:37 PM] Alex Markov: $200 to u as pm. $100 to HPM. $150 to rps
[08/21/2007 02:14:49 PM] Alex Markov: $250 to rps
[08/21/2007 02:14:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should reuse the ffz template
[08/21/2007 02:14:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be even cheaper
[08/21/2007 02:15:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: just send the photoshop file back to template designer for modification
[08/21/2007 02:16:01 PM] Alex Markov: sec
[08/21/2007 02:16:08 PM] Alex Markov: im trying to find it to look at it
[08/21/2007 02:16:22 PM] Alex Markov: so u will make $200 for coding it and $200 for managing it
[08/21/2007 02:16:27 PM] Alex Markov: not terrible for a starting project
[08/21/2007 02:16:52 PM] Alex Markov: if u like PM work and think u can do good at it ill start u up on a bunch of other smaller projects
[08/21/2007 02:16:54 PM] Alex Markov: errr
[08/21/2007 02:16:55 PM] Alex Markov: not smaller
[08/21/2007 02:16:56 PM] Alex Markov: larger
[08/21/2007 02:17:07 PM] Alex Markov: with actual budgets

[08/21/2007 02:41:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: why me?
[08/21/2007 02:41:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: there it goes
[08/21/2007 02:41:50 PM] *** Alex Markov has received C:\Documents and Settings\Brian Cullinan\My Documents\Websites\BART\docs\BART. Gallery. PC 1.5.doc.
[08/21/2007 02:45:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: see what i fixed?
[08/21/2007 02:50:13 PM] Alex Markov: Other options may include the size of thumbnails, customizable introduction/welcome text for the site, and per picture display options.
[08/21/2007 02:50:15 PM] Alex Markov: how much will this cost
[08/21/2007 02:50:21 PM] Alex Markov: if it costs anything.. we dont need it
[08/21/2007 02:50:38 PM] Alex Markov: and the size of thumbnails will not change because there will be 4 thumbnails per row. thats it
[08/21/2007 02:52:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok then remove resizable thumbnails
[08/21/2007 02:52:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just put extra picture options on there to make it look more pleasing
[08/21/2007 02:52:40 PM] Alex Markov: k
[08/21/2007 02:52:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't going to cost anything because i already have half the script written when i did FFZ
[08/21/2007 02:57:55 PM] Alex Markov: will it cost alot to take it out?
[08/21/2007 02:58:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: to take out descriptions?
[08/21/2007 02:58:20 PM] Alex Markov: and to option to resize
[08/21/2007 02:58:28 PM] Alex Markov: this eneds to be as simple as possible so idiot client does not fuck anything up
[08/21/2007 02:58:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually resize option was never implemented
[08/21/2007 02:58:38 PM] *** Alex Markov is trying to send you "BART. Gallery. PC 1.6.doc"
[08/21/2007 02:59:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: but either way it will be very cheap for us
[08/21/2007 02:59:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: half the script is already written
[08/21/2007 03:00:12 PM] Alex Markov: nice
[08/21/2007 03:00:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i need money for food
[08/21/2007 03:00:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so lets get this done quick
[08/21/2007 03:01:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it ready?
[08/21/2007 03:01:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: to send to client?
[08/21/2007 03:01:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: e-mail address and phone number?
[08/21/2007 03:01:28 PM] Alex Markov: look it over
[08/21/2007 03:02:28 PM] Alex Markov: i added that eacxh picture will ahve an artwrok title
[08/21/2007 03:02:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok title is also already implemented
[08/21/2007 03:02:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: so all we need to change is basically remove description
[08/21/2007 03:03:03 PM] Alex Markov: and so we can ahcnge order of pictures
[08/21/2007 03:03:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: piece of cake
[08/21/2007 03:03:18 PM] Alex Markov: same way we change order of staff members in that botnick staff thing u did a while back
[08/21/2007 03:03:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/21/2007 03:04:34 PM] Alex Markov: ok im calling client and will tell him u are going to fax it. 
[08/21/2007 03:05:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have a fax machine

[08/22/2007 11:17:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: so its clear SVN will not work with our current server's set up
[08/22/2007 11:22:09 AM] Alex Markov: god dammit
[08/22/2007 11:22:10 AM] Alex Markov: why not
[08/22/2007 11:22:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: don't know, i haven't been able to find any solutions for the error it keeps throwing back at me
[08/22/2007 11:23:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: uploading work just fine, but when i try to get information from the server it says "connection failed" or "malformed network data"

[08/22/2007 11:53:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have to take it down maybe once per month, even then its never very long, sometimes its just rebooting 1 virtual machine, so the SVN server is still up

[09/05/2007 08:31:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok back
[09/05/2007 08:31:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so lets see here my first rebuke
[09/05/2007 08:32:02 PM] Alex Markov: kk
[09/05/2007 08:32:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are only 3 of us working together and we have as much internal politics as microsoft and its very discouraging
[09/05/2007 08:32:44 PM] Alex Markov: lol
[09/05/2007 08:33:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is encouraging that this company has other focuses outside of just software development because from what i have learned in my software engineering class so far, you and Robert don't know anything about software engineering
[09/05/2007 08:33:16 PM] Alex Markov: yeah its not our focus
[09/05/2007 08:33:24 PM] Alex Markov: we try to make business owners lives easier
[09/05/2007 08:33:38 PM] Alex Markov: hows class going. learning anything interesting and or useful?
[09/05/2007 08:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: during that class i analyze software life cycle and realize how much our methods are out of line
[09/05/2007 08:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: we haven't implemented any software engineering life cycle, and what our current process resembles is a waterfall method, which is terribly inefficient, and looking back could be the cause of most of our problems between us and our clients
[09/05/2007 08:36:03 PM] Alex Markov: yeah. you are absolutly right
[09/05/2007 08:36:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so before the next project i need robert to write a protocol for requesting access permissions, and it needs to include that developers get access to the entire website
[09/05/2007 08:37:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: he got an internship at ebay and all of a sudden he knows everything
[09/05/2007 08:37:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: they have a completely different business model from us, so its ridiculous to try and enforce every method they use on our company
[09/05/2007 08:38:39 PM] Alex Markov: yeah we need to protocol our projects
[09/05/2007 08:38:43 PM] Alex Markov: thats a big task still not finished
[09/05/2007 08:40:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so with further study i think we need to choose a software engineering life cycle such as RUP and implement into everything.  It will be a big task, and implementing it will even include modifying the contracts that we make with clients
[09/05/2007 08:41:23 PM] Alex Markov: yes i agree 100%
[09/05/2007 08:42:05 PM] Alex Markov: ill start asking around regarding what other web development people use. i know a bunch of ceos of other firms to see if there is a common proccess of ANY process used by others. ill also psot in web development forums
[09/05/2007 08:42:12 PM] Alex Markov: i think such a lifecycle can apply to other things
[09/05/2007 08:42:21 PM] Alex Markov: good input brian
[09/05/2007 08:43:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so to conclude, robert is still a bitch and has no rebuttal for my previous e-mail, and i might be getting a job at ITS which would give me weekly paychecks which i desperately need.  but i will still have time to work on websites
[09/05/2007 09:00:43 PM] Alex Markov: yes get a job if u need steady money. until we get this beast of a company up on its feet it cannot promise steadiness
[09/05/2007 09:00:49 PM] Alex Markov: all in due time
[09/05/2007 09:03:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: wouldn't it be interesting to take 2 countries constantly at war and put in-penetrable domes right on top of the countries, separating them
[09/05/2007 09:03:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: would they stop shooting at the domes?
[09/05/2007 09:03:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: would the generations forget the disputes?
[09/05/2007 09:03:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: how would they react if the barrier was ever removed?
[09/05/2007 09:04:01 PM] Alex Markov: is this from homework?
[09/05/2007 09:04:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: would they enjoy being entirely cut off from the rest of the world? or would they turn on themselves and tear their country apart?
[09/05/2007 09:04:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, just pondering
[09/05/2007 09:04:24 PM] Alex Markov: tough questions
[09/05/2007 09:04:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it would be a good idea
[09/05/2007 09:04:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: think of how many soldiers we could save
[09/05/2007 09:04:49 PM] Alex Markov: true
[09/05/2007 09:04:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: how many wars could be immediately ended

[09/14/2007 03:28:27 PM] Alex Markov: so regarding AZRN and your payment
[09/14/2007 03:29:10 PM] Alex Markov: my problem is this. the client is PISSED. i am gonna be contacting them next week and giving them something for free or refund or something. not sure
[09/14/2007 03:30:00 PM] Alex Markov: your payment was for $100
[09/14/2007 03:30:32 PM] Alex Markov: we need to find another developer to make AZRN work right
[09/14/2007 03:30:45 PM] Alex Markov: at this point i dont really care about anything except that the client is pissed
[09/14/2007 03:30:53 PM] Alex Markov: now in response to your email
[09/14/2007 03:31:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i don't really give a shit if the client is pissed, its their fucking fault in the first place for using yahoo
[09/14/2007 03:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a lot of shit that happened that was entirely out of my control
[09/14/2007 03:31:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the entire site being reverted back to a previous non-working version
[09/14/2007 03:32:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about the other half of jambonie payment?  i was told in the first quarter of this year that i would be paid 1,500 dollars for jambonie
[09/14/2007 03:32:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: now it is done and i only have been paid half
[09/14/2007 03:32:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then you guys changed it to jambonie and ffz
[09/14/2007 03:32:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i did both of those
[09/14/2007 03:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you guys pissed off ffz, now i don't get paid
[09/14/2007 03:33:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so whats going on here?  are we not making enough money from clients to pay bills?
[09/14/2007 03:33:29 PM] Alex Markov: you said that we should have software engineering protocols. which i agree. however that is why we pay specialists. our specialists can use whatever software engineering protocols they want. that is upto the specialist. i only care it gets done
[09/14/2007 03:33:29 PM] Alex Markov: sec
[09/14/2007 03:33:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: are other people getting paid?
[09/14/2007 03:34:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i am done working with robert under these conditions
[09/14/2007 03:34:07 PM] Alex Markov: just curious. what things that happen that were out of your control with azrn
[09/14/2007 03:34:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys are too disorganized, and that was supposed to change this summer
[09/14/2007 03:34:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and nothing has changed
[09/14/2007 03:34:18 PM] Alex Markov: sec ill get to jam and ffz
[09/14/2007 03:35:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i listed some of the things that happened, errors were everywhere but we couldn't see them because they are using fucking yahoo, somehow a few weeks ago every file got replaced with an older version that didn't work, i have no idea how that happened
[09/14/2007 03:35:53 PM] Alex Markov: and we couldnt just upload the previous verison again that was saved on ur computer?
[09/14/2007 03:36:02 PM] Alex Markov: were changes being done to thelives server?
[09/14/2007 03:36:03 PM] Alex Markov: live
[09/14/2007 03:36:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: not at the time
[09/14/2007 03:36:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did have to replace every file back
[09/14/2007 03:36:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the client e-mailed us and said it wasn't working
[09/14/2007 03:36:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it took hours to figure out what was wrong
[09/14/2007 03:37:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: all because they were using fucking yahoo
[09/14/2007 03:37:42 PM] Alex Markov: a mass update couldnt just be uploaded overwritting all files?
[09/14/2007 03:38:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe, no idea
[09/14/2007 03:38:10 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[09/14/2007 03:38:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: still don't know what caused it
[09/14/2007 03:38:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but my point is, i've been working on this for months and got nothing for it
[09/14/2007 03:38:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: 100 dollars isn't even worth it for me
[09/14/2007 03:38:58 PM] Alex Markov: well i dont know what to do for azrn. on one hand u did spend alot of time on it. on the other hand... its still not working the right way.
[09/14/2007 03:39:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was told all it required was some database work, none of this fucking paypal shit
[09/14/2007 03:39:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i did the database work
[09/14/2007 03:39:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: for 100 dollars
[09/14/2007 03:39:29 PM] Alex Markov: im gonna send u $100 right now over paypal.
[09/14/2007 03:39:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: then robert told me to learn how to use paypal
[09/14/2007 03:39:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what do i get paid for that?
[09/14/2007 03:40:16 PM] Alex Markov: im gonna hire some other developer to make sure it works right. because frnakly i dont care about anything else other than that client is pissed
[09/14/2007 03:41:07 PM] Alex Markov: giveme ur paypal
[09/14/2007 03:41:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: b.cullinan@cox.net
[09/14/2007 03:41:51 PM] Alex Markov: regarding the $1500
[09/14/2007 03:42:05 PM] Alex Markov: it was for jam and ffz
[09/14/2007 03:42:11 PM] Alex Markov: that was what it totalled upto
[09/14/2007 03:42:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: originally robert said it was for jambonie alone
[09/14/2007 03:42:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you guys changed it
[09/14/2007 03:42:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i didn't figure that out until i got the first 750
[09/14/2007 03:42:47 PM] Alex Markov: i am pretty sure it was like $1300 for jam and $200 for ffz or some breakdown like that. 
[09/14/2007 03:43:21 PM] Alex Markov: i pretty sure i was the one who put the updated # at $1500 for both projects
[09/14/2007 03:43:44 PM] Alex Markov: it was a combination
[09/14/2007 03:44:15 PM] Alex Markov: ill look into it and see what i can find. acc has been reorganized since then. those records are with the accountant
[09/14/2007 03:44:42 PM] Alex Markov: so u got paid $750 and u still have a $750 check.
[09/14/2007 03:45:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that you don't was me to cash
[09/14/2007 03:45:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what is to stop me from cashing it right now?
[09/14/2007 03:45:39 PM] Alex Markov: nothing
[09/14/2007 03:45:58 PM] Alex Markov: sec
[09/14/2007 03:46:13 PM] Alex Markov: ummm i forget again. what was the $750 check on 6/08/07 for?
[09/14/2007 03:46:29 PM] Alex Markov: i know there was $1500 after that
[09/14/2007 03:46:41 PM] Alex Markov: but do u remember what was that for?
[09/14/2007 03:46:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i cashed 1 check for 750, i am waiting for you to give me the go ahead for the second half
[09/14/2007 03:47:32 PM] Alex Markov: that was that first oen right?
[09/14/2007 03:47:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[09/14/2007 03:48:02 PM] Alex Markov: phone sec
[09/14/2007 03:48:33 PM] Alex Markov: ok
[09/14/2007 03:49:25 PM] Alex Markov: well i just sent out over $5,000 in bills in past month. funds are tight. yearly $1600 to sugar. acc reorg and tons of other bullshit. insurance. ect
[09/14/2007 03:49:32 PM] Alex Markov: if u cash the check... it wont bounce
[09/14/2007 03:49:50 PM] Alex Markov: fucking FFZ rly fucked us up. we had a major loss on that project
[09/14/2007 03:49:56 PM] Alex Markov: its going to lawyers and collections right now
[09/14/2007 03:50:02 PM] Alex Markov: so eventually we may be in the clear
[09/14/2007 03:50:24 PM] Alex Markov: it was an error of contracts not being clear enough and rly crazy bitchy women
[09/14/2007 03:50:35 PM] Alex Markov: i would prefer that you wait a bit on cashing that $750
[09/14/2007 03:51:38 PM] Alex Markov: if you do need it and its life and death. let me know u cash it so i can make sure there are funds there at the time. i beleive the check u have is for the account for our general expenses and i dont keep so much in there at all times
[09/14/2007 03:51:54 PM] Alex Markov: so let me know before u cash it so i make sure it doesnt bounce and then i have to write another check. pain in the ass
[09/14/2007 03:52:21 PM] Alex Markov: but as a favor i ask u hold it for a bit. we were gonna pay your 2nd $750 from FFZ and they just flaked out
[09/14/2007 03:53:54 PM] Alex Markov: so regarding azrn... dont worry about it. chalk it up to experience. live and learn. im gonna hire someone to make it work right. 
[09/14/2007 03:54:08 PM] Alex Markov: unless you know for a fact u can fix it to work the way it should
[09/14/2007 03:54:19 PM] Alex Markov: ill be back in a little bit. dinner is rdy. 
[09/14/2007 03:54:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i found a problem with it
[09/14/2007 04:00:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am done working with robert
[09/14/2007 04:01:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will be looking forward to cashing that check sometime before next year
[09/14/2007 04:02:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and until Robert changes his general attitude towards taking my advice, i won't be working with him
[09/14/2007 04:07:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and for all i care, this client can suck my cock
