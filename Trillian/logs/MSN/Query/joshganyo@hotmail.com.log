[10/29/2007 10:01:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/29/2007 10:01:41 PM] Josh Ganyo: and girls want what they can't have / want other girls bfs to feel like they're better

[10/29/2007 10:01:47 PM] Josh Ganyo: yeah
[10/29/2007 10:03:07 PM] Josh Ganyo: but really a 6 is as low as you should ever go
[10/29/2007 10:03:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know
[10/29/2007 10:05:37 PM] Josh Ganyo: you might want to skip leveraging the 6 and just go after the one of the 8s friends
