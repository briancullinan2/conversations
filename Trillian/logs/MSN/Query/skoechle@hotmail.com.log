[04/20/2008 10:43:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: *math
[04/20/2008 10:43:43 PM] Steve Koechle: yea so then that would be a bad idea for u
[04/20/2008 10:45:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i will just take general physics
[04/20/2008 10:46:27 PM] Steve Koechle: do u need the lab sciences?
[04/20/2008 10:46:40 PM] Steve Koechle:  cuz i'm pretty sure it has to be university physics to count for that
[04/20/2008 10:47:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i don't need the lab science

[04/20/2008 10:49:21 PM] Steve Koechle: kinda cool... got boring at some parts though.... if Best is teaching it he is hillarious
[04/20/2008 10:50:08 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont remember how long the lab was... but its stuff like interpret this map or look at these rocks
[04/20/2008 10:50:12 PM] Steve Koechle: nothing complicated

[04/26/2008 07:48:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree
[04/26/2008 07:48:17 PM] Steve Koechle: i am going to ask you for one thing
[04/26/2008 07:48:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: anything
[04/26/2008 07:48:44 PM] Steve Koechle: crystal would not talk to me because she wants to talk to you first
[04/26/2008 07:49:02 PM] Steve Koechle: she promised me she would save your chat history and let me read it after the fact
[04/26/2008 07:49:04 PM] Steve Koechle: ask her
[04/26/2008 07:49:11 PM] Steve Koechle: i think she will delete it though
[04/26/2008 07:49:21 PM] Steve Koechle: if she does i'm coming to you for it
[04/26/2008 07:49:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: understood
[04/26/2008 07:49:39 PM] Steve Koechle: and if you want any hope of us being cool again u better give it to me
[04/26/2008 07:49:58 PM] Steve Koechle: just so u know i am trying to keep things together with her
[04/26/2008 07:50:04 PM] Steve Koechle: so i would like you to support theat
[04/26/2008 07:50:06 PM] Steve Koechle: *that
[04/26/2008 07:50:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do
[04/26/2008 07:50:40 PM] Steve Koechle: then stop saying the things you do to her on messenger
[04/26/2008 07:50:47 PM] Steve Koechle: stop telling her you like her
[04/26/2008 07:51:15 PM] Steve Koechle: she is very easily influenced and its partly why she's been having so many problems
[04/26/2008 07:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/26/2008 07:51:43 PM] Steve Koechle: and so u know, she knows i've been wanting to put a ring on that finger for 2 years
[04/26/2008 07:51:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: she told me none of this
[04/26/2008 07:52:07 PM] Steve Koechle: i didnt expect her to
[04/26/2008 07:52:09 PM] Steve Koechle: thats why i am
[04/26/2008 07:52:20 PM] Steve Koechle: i know she is mostly at fault but u still participated
[04/26/2008 07:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: that i true, i did not stop anything from happening
[04/26/2008 07:52:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: *is true
[04/26/2008 07:53:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i suppose now i owe you an explanation
[04/26/2008 07:54:01 PM] Steve Koechle: give it ur best shot
[04/26/2008 07:54:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: up until last night everything i said to her, and everything we talked about, and our entire friendship has been completely harmless
[04/26/2008 07:54:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i was in full support of her working things out with you, i encouraged her to talk to you, and stay with you
[04/26/2008 07:55:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i could tell you that alcohol had a lot to do with it, but despite what you may believe, i respect you more then that, so i'll will be honest with you
[04/26/2008 07:56:34 PM] Steve Koechle: we had the best last week we have had in over a year
[04/26/2008 07:56:41 PM] Steve Koechle: and i know alcohol was involved
[04/26/2008 07:56:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and who do you think is responsible for that?
[04/26/2008 07:57:21 PM] Steve Koechle: which part
[04/26/2008 07:57:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: you having a great week together
[04/26/2008 07:57:50 PM] Steve Koechle: me because i went out of my fucking way to treat her like a princess despite the fact i have a shit ton to do
[04/26/2008 07:58:22 PM] Steve Koechle: if you are implying u did you are sorely mistaken and i resent u saying that
[04/26/2008 07:58:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: that brings me to my next point
[04/26/2008 07:58:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was but i do like her, i never told her that i did, i told her she is attractive, i told her she has nice hair, but i never told her i liked her
[04/26/2008 07:59:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: she deserves the world, and if you can't give that to her then you have to let her go, if you can, like you did last week, then you should lock it down
[04/26/2008 08:00:21 PM] Steve Koechle: i thought i was locking it down
[04/26/2008 08:00:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but making her happy is "going out of your way"?
[04/26/2008 08:01:29 PM] Steve Koechle: jesus christ if you dont want me to kick ur ass shut the fuck up
[04/26/2008 08:01:42 PM] Steve Koechle: i am so pissed right now i ccant even form a real sentence
[04/26/2008 08:01:48 PM] Steve Koechle: of course you shouldnt take me litereally
[04/26/2008 08:02:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never meant to interfere, and you are absolutely right, you probably should hit me, but she is worth fighting for
[04/26/2008 08:02:56 PM] Steve Koechle: u dont even know her
[04/26/2008 08:03:08 PM] Steve Koechle: i have been with her since the beggining of freshman year
[04/26/2008 08:03:39 PM] Steve Koechle: we had a slight falling out (which all relationships have at some point) and now you are telling me what my relationship is about?
[04/26/2008 08:04:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am telling you i have been in your position
[04/26/2008 08:04:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that you are not wrong to hate me
[04/26/2008 08:04:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that you completely deserve a free hit to my face
[04/26/2008 08:05:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am warning you, that isn't going to change anything between you and crystal
[04/26/2008 08:05:26 PM] Steve Koechle: look this neeeds to stop before it gets worse.... i';m out

[04/28/2008 02:31:14 AM] Steve Koechle: u there?
[04/28/2008 02:33:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 02:33:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you finish the scheme project?
[04/28/2008 02:33:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: Leah is really upset with it
[04/28/2008 02:33:28 AM] Steve Koechle: no dude, i've had too many issues if you can imagine
[04/28/2008 02:33:44 AM] Steve Koechle: look i'm still not cool with you but i'm not fuming either
[04/28/2008 02:33:55 AM] Steve Koechle: i just want to talk to u about crystal
[04/28/2008 02:34:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i understand
[04/28/2008 02:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: but just to mention i may very well be the only person to finish this project, so if you need help over the next couple of days, don't be afraid to ask
[04/28/2008 02:34:58 AM] Steve Koechle: its due tomorrow morning though
[04/28/2008 02:35:03 AM] Steve Koechle: at 8 am
[04/28/2008 02:35:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: didn't you get an extension?
[04/28/2008 02:35:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is what Leah said
[04/28/2008 02:35:34 AM] Steve Koechle: no
[04/28/2008 02:35:39 AM] Steve Koechle: i was denied by abe
[04/28/2008 02:35:45 AM] Steve Koechle: so i didnt ask
[04/28/2008 02:36:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, that is strange abe is usually the understanding one
[04/28/2008 02:36:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: but at least he and eck give a lot of late points
[04/28/2008 02:36:29 AM] Steve Koechle: look i know things have been bad between me and crystal, and we both let things slip.  Before u met her we were starting to work things out.
[04/28/2008 02:36:44 AM] Steve Koechle: i really love her more than i can put into words
[04/28/2008 02:37:12 AM] Steve Koechle: i know i can make her feel special and be there for her through all the good and bad times
[04/28/2008 02:37:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/28/2008 02:38:05 AM] Steve Koechle: i am trying so hard to just have her give us one more chance, because she was withdrawn before not thinking we could fix it.  I just want a chance to show her
[04/28/2008 02:38:19 AM] Steve Koechle: if things dont work out from their at least i know i tried
[04/28/2008 02:38:33 AM] Steve Koechle: i really want to know what you think you can give her
[04/28/2008 02:38:36 AM] Steve Koechle: and for how long
[04/28/2008 02:41:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is a really hard question, i don't know how long, i suppose it would be up to her
[04/28/2008 02:41:35 AM] Steve Koechle: would you be willing to follow a long distance relationship to ithica new york?
[04/28/2008 02:42:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i told her i didn't need a commitment from her, and i would be here for her
[04/28/2008 02:42:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: if she decided to see someone else in NY, i may be disappointed but it is her choice
[04/28/2008 02:43:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: anywho lets not talk about me
[04/28/2008 02:43:20 AM] Steve Koechle: u were right she is worth fighting for and i dont intend on just stepping aside.  despite what you did with her i still want to make her my wife.  I know she doesnt feel the same way about me right now but she still says a life with me sounds good
[04/28/2008 02:43:46 AM] Steve Koechle: i am asking you to be the honorable friend that you told me you were on the phone, and not date a friends ex gf
[04/28/2008 02:44:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel bad about maybe making things worse, a lot of people thought it was just a long time coming for you two, if things had gone down in a different order then we would be having a very different conversation
[04/28/2008 02:45:20 AM] Steve Koechle: who are alot of people
[04/28/2008 02:47:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i will make a deal with you, assuming she chooses to take your offer and give it another shot, i will back off, i won't invite her to any more parties, but i am not going to stop being her friend, all i ask in return is you forgive me for fraking up.  until she makes her decision i want start any conversation with her, and i will be completely neutral 
[04/28/2008 02:47:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: for everyone's sake, i hope she decides to take your offer
[04/28/2008 02:48:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you want to negotiate anything?
[04/28/2008 02:48:47 AM] Steve Koechle: i'm trying to figure out how to respond to that
[04/28/2008 02:50:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: that may have been a little bold, but i am going out on a limb because i can't help being attracted to her
[04/28/2008 02:50:57 AM] Steve Koechle: cant you see that you might be destroying something bigger than you can possibly imagine?
[04/28/2008 02:51:16 AM] Steve Koechle: you met her when she was unsure, i dont think she told you about the good times
[04/28/2008 02:51:31 AM] Steve Koechle: she probably never told you we got her ring finger measured
[04/28/2008 02:52:01 AM] Steve Koechle: can you deal with the fact that she is bi-polar and occasionally has mainc or depression episodes?
[04/28/2008 02:52:26 AM] Steve Koechle: u have no idea about her family structure and all the things that go with that
[04/28/2008 02:52:49 AM] Steve Koechle: i got her off drugs freshman year, i helped her to become the driven student she is
[04/28/2008 02:53:00 AM] Steve Koechle: i believe in her and i know she can do anything she want
[04/28/2008 02:53:01 AM] Steve Koechle: s
[04/28/2008 02:53:13 AM] Steve Koechle: i will follow her where ever she goes
[04/28/2008 02:53:44 AM] Steve Koechle: i really want to make the perfect life with her....
[04/28/2008 02:54:15 AM] Steve Koechle: not a fling and just to be there for her... i want it all
[04/28/2008 02:54:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can understand that
[04/28/2008 02:54:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: have you expressed all of this to her?
[04/28/2008 02:55:02 AM] Steve Koechle: yes but i dont know if she thinks i'm serious
[04/28/2008 02:55:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would say her decision should be obvious
[04/28/2008 02:55:37 AM] Steve Koechle: but thats my point
[04/28/2008 02:55:53 AM] Steve Koechle: you are clouding it.... there are a million girls out there
[04/28/2008 02:55:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: look, if you are that determined, then there is nothing i can do to get in the way
[04/28/2008 02:56:03 AM] Steve Koechle: why cant u let this one go
[04/28/2008 02:56:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not trying to tie her down at all, i have remained relatively neutral
[04/28/2008 02:57:05 AM] Steve Koechle: i can be as determined as i want but she is stuborn... if she wants to explore the possibilites with you she wont think about long term reprocussions
[04/28/2008 02:57:34 AM] Steve Koechle: i only asked her for one thing to give me trust back and that is not to see you
[04/28/2008 02:57:51 AM] Steve Koechle: i told her i didnt want her talking to you but i can understand that she will do it anyway
[04/28/2008 02:58:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we all need to relax
[04/28/2008 02:58:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: this has been blown way out of proportion
[04/28/2008 02:58:31 AM] Steve Koechle: that might be easy for you to say but i really dont think you grasp the magnitude of the situation
[04/28/2008 02:59:29 AM] Steve Koechle: you are literally talking about my entire future, and hers as well.  to you she might just be another girl.  You cant just let "the one" walk away from you
[04/28/2008 02:59:52 AM] Steve Koechle: thats why i'm able to forgive her
[04/28/2008 03:00:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: allow me to express another point of view, when she leaves for NY aren't you afraid she could just as easily meet someone there?  especially if she is willing to go behind your back even when she can be with you here?  i don't mean to instill doubt, but i would be concerned and certainly be taking more affirmative action then you are now.
[04/28/2008 03:00:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: and if she is the one, then you will both absolutely find a way to be together
[04/28/2008 03:01:21 AM] Steve Koechle: she told me that would never happen again and i honestly believe her
[04/28/2008 03:02:23 AM] Steve Koechle: and if she meets someone there then thats her deal, i believe we would end things the right way and then at least i was able to try again
[04/28/2008 03:02:36 AM] Steve Koechle: i'll know i had a great summer with her and thats what will matter
[04/28/2008 03:04:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mean to be a difficult person, i really don't
[04/28/2008 03:05:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i understand the magnitude of your feelings for her, and that is why i think her decision is so important
[04/28/2008 03:06:05 AM] Steve Koechle: it is and i want her to totally understand that before she makes it
[04/28/2008 03:08:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i have just always believed it is better to have more experience, it helps a person define what they want in a partner
[04/28/2008 03:09:48 AM] Steve Koechle: the problem is she wants both
[04/28/2008 03:09:55 AM] Steve Koechle: she wants to be with you then come back to me
[04/28/2008 03:10:01 AM] Steve Koechle: and i dont know if i can stand for that
[04/28/2008 03:10:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i understand
[04/28/2008 03:10:40 AM] Steve Koechle: and like i said i really dont think she knows what she will be throwing away if she does
[04/28/2008 03:11:52 AM] Steve Koechle:  i really dont mind you being a friend to her, if you can actually assure me and not lie this time.... that thats all it would be
[04/28/2008 03:12:15 AM] Steve Koechle: i just dont want you to have any romantic relationship in any way with her
[04/28/2008 03:13:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't mean to lie, and everything i told you on the phone i meant, i did not have the intention to pursue her but she had other plans
[04/28/2008 03:13:50 AM] Steve Koechle: she was drunk dude
[04/28/2008 03:13:57 AM] Steve Koechle: that would have never happened sober 
[04/28/2008 03:14:04 AM] Steve Koechle: maybe now it would but not the first time
[04/28/2008 03:14:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know a lot of people that don't come on to other people when they are drunk
[04/28/2008 03:15:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: but she is unique
[04/28/2008 03:15:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is no reason to blame me
[04/28/2008 03:15:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: sorry for my sporadic arguments, ideas are not as well formulated in IM
[04/28/2008 03:15:47 AM] Steve Koechle: no u not stopping it is a reason
[04/28/2008 03:16:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: well that was because i was drunk
[04/28/2008 03:16:12 AM] Steve Koechle: well thats not an excuse either
[04/28/2008 03:16:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know studies have shown that e-mail is the most honest form of communication
[04/28/2008 03:16:50 AM] Steve Koechle: im is better than that in my opinion unless thats included
[04/28/2008 03:17:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: in IM you talk to quickly without creating well formulated ideas
[04/28/2008 03:18:40 AM] Steve Koechle: well i just sent u the email i sent her the wed before u did stuff
[04/28/2008 03:19:32 AM] Steve Koechle: we had a date night planned for saturday.... i wanted to show her what she meant to me
[04/28/2008 03:19:47 AM] Steve Koechle: i special ordered some wine that i knew was really good
[04/28/2008 03:22:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like her heart is in the right place
[04/28/2008 03:22:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i sent you an e-mail
[04/28/2008 03:22:44 AM] Steve Koechle: yea 
[04/28/2008 03:22:53 AM] Steve Koechle: i read it
[04/28/2008 03:22:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: all of it?
[04/28/2008 03:23:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: that was quick
[04/28/2008 03:23:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i meant
[04/28/2008 03:23:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: a knew one
[04/28/2008 03:23:15 AM] Steve Koechle: ur convo with her
[04/28/2008 03:23:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: that i was just talking to her about
[04/28/2008 03:23:41 AM] Steve Koechle: thats not neutral though
[04/28/2008 03:23:46 AM] Steve Koechle: i just want u to know
[04/28/2008 03:23:53 AM] Steve Koechle: Brian Cullinan: if we spent the next two weeks developing this great relationship, and continued to talk all the time online during the summer and while you are in NY
[04/28/2008 03:23:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: it gets better
[04/28/2008 03:24:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is just an example
[04/28/2008 03:24:04 AM] Steve Koechle: that makes her think you will have an amazing relationship
[04/28/2008 03:24:12 AM] Steve Koechle: thats not how she'll take it though
[04/28/2008 03:24:44 AM] Steve Koechle: she will think that means you want to be with her and expect it to be amazingly wonderful and you want to continue through NY
[04/28/2008 03:25:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tried my best, you are welcome to present a count example
[04/28/2008 03:25:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: look, IMHO and that of others you should let it play or step it up
[04/28/2008 03:26:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: but for the sake of being diplomatic, i will not see her sexually
[04/28/2008 03:26:49 AM] Steve Koechle: i'm trying to step it up, but she wont let me
[04/28/2008 03:26:59 AM] Steve Koechle: she said shes too confused about the situation
[04/28/2008 03:27:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: have you tried flowers?
[04/28/2008 03:28:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: capricorns love constant displays of gratitude through small, fiscally responsible gifts
[04/28/2008 03:28:44 AM] Steve Koechle: well i bought her forever roses on our 3rd year anniversary
[04/28/2008 03:28:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean since two days ago
[04/28/2008 03:29:10 AM] Steve Koechle: i was going to suprise her with her favorite candy bar and a card on saturday before this whole thing blew up
[04/28/2008 03:29:24 AM] Steve Koechle: she told me she wants space how can i intrude on that
[04/28/2008 03:29:40 AM] Steve Koechle: while i love her i respect her
[04/28/2008 03:30:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: do it subtly is what i would suggest
[04/28/2008 03:30:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: [04/28/2008 03:27:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i made it sound like we could have something great, but if there is no sexual contact and the next two weeks are mediocre for you, do you think you would see steve again?
 [04/28/2008 03:28:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes.
[04/28/2008 03:30:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know man she doesn't seem confused she seems like she just needs space
[04/28/2008 03:30:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably from both of us
[04/28/2008 03:31:01 AM] Steve Koechle: i know thats what i'm saying she feels like you would be a sexually exciting adventure for two weeks
[04/28/2008 03:31:13 AM] Steve Koechle: and honestly if that happened me and you would never be cool
[04/28/2008 03:31:17 AM] Steve Koechle: just being honest
[04/28/2008 03:31:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: honesty is good
[04/28/2008 03:31:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i told her there wouldn't be any sexual contact
[04/28/2008 03:31:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i am fine with that
[04/28/2008 03:32:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: it always seems to complicate things anyways
[04/28/2008 03:32:53 AM] Steve Koechle: i really appreciate u taking that step
[04/28/2008 03:33:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: so why don't we sleep on it, i won't try to "get with her", but i am not going to stop being her friend
[04/28/2008 03:33:48 AM] Steve Koechle: it really means alot to me despite whats happened
[04/28/2008 03:34:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: she needs independence, so why don't we all just focus on school the last few weeks
[04/28/2008 03:34:40 AM] Steve Koechle: agreed however you kinda know how i feel... i would greatly appreciate if you can help her see what she is to me
[04/28/2008 03:34:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will do my best
[04/28/2008 03:35:01 AM] Steve Koechle: thank you

[05/02/2008 02:35:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i c
[05/02/2008 02:35:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: kind of just the "you need to see this through" attitude i previously suggested she take
[05/02/2008 02:36:16 AM] Steve Koechle: what do u mean
[05/02/2008 02:37:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i mean before she stopped talking to me i told her that she needs to focus on seeing you this week, and concentrate on you and her priorities.  i think the letter was similar to that idea
[05/02/2008 02:37:44 AM] Steve Koechle: well unfortunatly thats not the case, she has continued to lie to me about you and her, and even about trying to make things work
[05/02/2008 02:38:10 AM] Steve Koechle: to her telling me she was going to try meant, i am trying to make it not hurt so bad for you but i'm leaving you anyway
[05/02/2008 02:38:16 AM] Steve Koechle: look i am really wanting to know your feelings / intentions
[05/02/2008 02:39:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: well, i avoided talking to her all week, i figured you guys would have your date and things would kind of settle down.
[05/02/2008 02:40:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: i certainly like talking to her, so this week has been hard/uninteresting
[05/02/2008 02:41:56 AM] Steve Koechle: i want you to know i really feel like you are simply a replacement to a bad year in our relationship... new people and relationships are inherently exciting
[05/02/2008 02:42:26 AM] Steve Koechle: i know she still likes me, she's said that too me, its just it would be harder for us to fix things than her to start something new
[05/02/2008 02:42:52 AM] Steve Koechle: she hasnt given us a chance because for some reason she is becoming increasingly infatuated with you
[05/02/2008 02:43:21 AM] Steve Koechle: now why i say you are a replacement, is because all the things she used to do in relation to me, she is now only doing with you
[05/02/2008 02:43:29 AM] Steve Koechle: for example
[05/02/2008 02:44:35 AM] Steve Koechle: she says she loves talking to you about random whatever, and i have tried to do that lately and she is just overly annoyed.... she says she cant do any work or study without u being there on messenger to talk to.  Karan said she has always been like that with me, and very frustrated when i'm not online
[05/02/2008 02:45:29 AM] Steve Koechle: she spent today telling me how she cant wait to talk to you while also telling me she doesnt understand how that hurts me
[05/02/2008 02:47:15 AM] Steve Koechle: she is also paranoid that you dont like her now because u blocked her

[05/02/2008 12:36:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i finally got a chance
[05/02/2008 12:36:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[05/02/2008 12:36:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i slept through my alarm, i think i am going to get fired
[05/02/2008 12:37:10 PM] Steve Koechle: so do u need to review what i was saying last night because i want to pick it up at the same place
[05/02/2008 12:37:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: right
[05/02/2008 12:38:42 PM] Steve Koechle: i never got whatever u were typing last night either
[05/02/2008 12:38:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh, i just wanted to tell you that if those things you say are true and she does still have feelings for you, then she will find her way back to you.  However i have always been a fan of having mature relationship experience, it really helps a person determine what they want in a relationship and their partner.
[05/02/2008 12:40:07 PM] Steve Koechle: right so i was going to continue to say last night
[05/02/2008 12:40:10 PM] Steve Koechle: so i asked her, if brian doesnt like you what then?  would you want to come back to me?  and she said yes but with a break first
[05/02/2008 12:41:44 PM] Steve Koechle: i really think that in her mind she sees me and her as work and you and her as fun... i dont know if she will ever understand what she is throwing away, and honestly i dont know if i will be able to take her back after she goes to you... that would all have to be seen in the future
[05/02/2008 12:42:47 PM] Steve Koechle: the purpose of her not to talk to you was so that we could work things out.... when i found out that she wasnt going to do that i encouraged her to continue not talking to you to help her and you see what you really want
[05/02/2008 12:43:07 PM] Steve Koechle: apparently that was too much for her and she really really just wants to be around you all the time
[05/02/2008 12:44:14 PM] Steve Koechle: two other things i wanted to note... all the way up until what happened with you and her, we were doing things that you would never do with someone you are about to leave
[05/02/2008 12:44:45 PM] Steve Koechle: some of those, very initimate and personal, and she wouldn want me to go into details with you
[05/02/2008 12:45:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i understand
[05/02/2008 12:45:46 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont know where her mind is and no one will except her... she says she doesnt think this should be a suprise, but even our closest friends call it surreal and dont see how this could have happend
[05/02/2008 12:45:48 PM] Steve Koechle: the other thing
[05/02/2008 12:46:02 PM] Steve Koechle: there is one thing that i honestly think is really bad between u and her
[05/02/2008 12:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is that?
[05/02/2008 12:47:09 PM] Steve Koechle: so i mentioned before she is bi-polar.... she wanted me to express that while she has episodes they arent frequent... She has stopped seeing her counsilors and psychiatris with the exception of when she needs meds... i've been trying to get her to go back
[05/02/2008 12:47:11 PM] Steve Koechle: anyway
[05/02/2008 12:47:56 PM] Steve Koechle: the one thing her doctor told her is that she needs consistent 8 hours of sleep every night, because unlike other people it will affect her much more, and will make it more likely for her to go into depression
[05/02/2008 12:48:36 PM] Steve Koechle: she loves talking to you into all hours of the night, and if you want her to stay healthy you need to make her go to sleep or at the least stop talking to you so she'll get board and go to sleep
[05/02/2008 12:49:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, i think we all just had a lot of projects to work on this last week, everyone should get a healthy amount of sleep
[05/02/2008 12:49:45 PM] Steve Koechle: she also forgets to take her meds from time to time, its not inappropriate for you to ask her every morning if she did, she wont be offended
[05/02/2008 12:50:16 PM] Steve Koechle: i'm not telling u these things because i'm ok with the situation, i still think its the shittiest shadiest thing that could happen
[05/02/2008 12:50:30 PM] Steve Koechle: but i think you know i love her and i just want the best for her, no matter what she has done to me
[05/02/2008 12:50:47 PM] Steve Koechle: i want to believe if she will leave me for you, you will take care of her
[05/02/2008 12:50:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i understand
[05/02/2008 12:51:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will do everything i can
[05/02/2008 12:54:52 PM] Steve Koechle: i know she says you have talked about this but i think it would also be really good for her to take it slow, and build into your relationship... coming out of a long serious relation tends to accelerate things, and i think both of you can benifit from removing the sexual stuff and building a great friendship first. (I'm saying there should be a time frame)
[05/02/2008 12:55:28 PM] Steve Koechle: its just i'd hate to see you guys fucking in like a week (not that i'd know about it).  i think it would only encourage a shallow relationship
[05/02/2008 12:55:31 PM] Steve Koechle: just keep in mind after almost 4 years when things got hard for once she'd rather run than fix them.... i just hope the same thing doesnt happen to you
[05/02/2008 12:57:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i appreciate that, but she is not my first girlfriend, part of the fun is discovering all these problems and good things, i agree entirely with the sexual stuff, and i was going to suggest to her holding off on that part, but she beat me to it.
[05/02/2008 12:58:06 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont intend for things to get better between me and you anytime soon if at all, I am also going to stop talking to her until i can handle whats happened and move on
[05/02/2008 12:58:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i understand
[05/02/2008 12:59:36 PM] Steve Koechle: i also told her no matter what mine and her relationship is, if she is having problems with certain things from her past i want her to ask me for help.... likewise if you see her declining into any extreme negative action, dont hesitate to ask me to step up and help her
[05/02/2008 01:00:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[05/02/2008 01:00:16 PM] Steve Koechle: goodbye
[05/02/2008 01:00:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: bye

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Steve Koechle): Wed May 07 19:13:31 2008
[05/07/2008 07:13:32 PM] Steve Koechle: out  of curiousity, a little while ago crystal made it sound like you told her shes not allowed to talk to me.... did you?
[05/07/2008 07:14:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never said she wasn't allowed, i told her the same thing i would tell you.  you guys definitely need to get on the same page with your feelins and understand each other, but it should wait until after finals, and you guys need to focus on passing classes
[05/07/2008 07:18:02 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont think we will ever get on the same page... i really feel like she transfered a lot of her remaining feelings from our relationship to yours.  I dont know if she has told you anything i have said to her in the last week but i think she is basically going to shut me out until you are completely out of the picture (and who knows how long that will take)
[05/07/2008 07:21:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: She told me she was a little annoyed because she is trying really hard to get work done.  She does feel bad that this is affecting your school work as well.  But i think these things take time, I will encourage her to express her feelings about all this to you, but you also have to ask how she is feeling.
[05/07/2008 07:24:24 PM] Steve Koechle: i have asked... and she has made it very clear to me that she does have feelings for you, i dont doubt that. But she also still has some feelings for me.  I dont care what she does with you, but i feel like she is trying to make those feeling for me completely disappear.  I am willing to wait for her to do what she wants, go to cornell and come back.  I really would take her back after all that.
[05/07/2008 07:25:14 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont know if you really realize how i feel about her.  i just cant let it go yet.  i can wait that long because i know she is worth it
[05/07/2008 07:31:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: I think you have made your feelings for her very obvious.  But ultimately she will make her own decisions.  I still have feelings for my previous girlfriends, and i respect them as people.  I understand that you don't want to give up on the relationship, i was very much that way with a girlfriend in high school, she moved on, and i didn't.  Now every time i see her it is just plain awkward, but there were better relationships after that because it was all a good experience.
[05/07/2008 07:34:28 PM] Steve Koechle: i dont consider this just another relationship though, i really honestly believed she was going to marry me. Like in my mind we were unofficially engaged.  So this situation is a total flip on that idea, and i really cant move on yet. The fact that she bounced right to you with zero time in between really really hurts me. It makes me feel like the last 4 years meant nothing to her.
[05/07/2008 07:35:06 PM] Steve Koechle: i'm not saying i cant move on, i really just am not ready yet... so i will do it on my own terms. and believe me i have left her alone to the best of my ability, i know talking to her about it only hurts my cause
[05/07/2008 07:36:43 PM] Steve Koechle: i mean like 2 days before she met you i asked her if she had any reason at all to think we might not be together while she was at cornell and she said no we were going to be fine
[05/07/2008 07:37:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think that is the case at all.  There are always going to be happy memories.  And i do feel bad about the way this all played out, my best friend in high school made his dating anniversary with the girl i couldn't get over before i stopped dating her.  I think the problem here was the feelings were not mutual, i am not saying they were strong or didn't mean anything, they were just not the same.
[05/07/2008 07:38:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: *i don't think that is the case was relating to "the last 4 years meant nothing to her"
[05/07/2008 07:39:25 PM] Steve Koechle: i honeslty believe her talking to you made her feel much more like it was over or couldnt be fixed... because despite what she may say, no one was saying our relationship was over... this is a total shock to all our mutual friends, no one saw this coming. and like i just said above, we did talk about if we would make it better and be fine and she told me everytime we would be
[05/07/2008 07:40:49 PM] Steve Koechle: theres nothing really more to say here.... i mean we all know how everyone in this fucked up triangle feels... and i really dont think anything will change.  if you have ever been in a situation like mine at all, then you should know why i cant just let go and move on
[05/07/2008 07:42:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, i understand you can't let it go, and i don't blame you, but i think you should wait to not let it go until after finals, that is all.
[05/07/2008 07:43:39 PM] Steve Koechle: you have to understand i have not exactly been harassing her... i have brought this up for maybe 10 mins every two days.... all things considered i think that is pretty good progress
[05/07/2008 07:43:50 PM] Steve Koechle: and i have told her i wont talk to her again until after finals
[05/07/2008 07:44:03 PM] Steve Koechle: i just think its really fucked up that she is still lying to me
[05/07/2008 07:44:21 PM] Steve Koechle: (like saying she didnt block me when she clearly did)
[05/07/2008 07:44:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: On MSN it says blocked next to the name when you get blocked.
[05/07/2008 07:45:43 PM] Steve Koechle: if you block that person
[05/07/2008 07:45:46 PM] Steve Koechle: not if they block you
[05/07/2008 07:46:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty sure it goes both ways, she blocked keifer a while ago and he told me that is what it said
[05/07/2008 07:46:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: try it, i'll tell you what it says
[05/07/2008 07:46:57 PM] Steve Koechle: she blocked me almost all of yesterday and it only said she was offline, i actually did another test with a friend yesterday and it doesnt say that

[05/07/2008 07:47:52 PM] Steve Koechle: i know because she was talking to you, while she was offline right after telling me she didnt block me.... its just petty at this point that she cant tell me the truth
[05/07/2008 07:48:11 PM] Steve Koechle: and say i'm blocking your ass because i dont want to talk to you, thats how easy it is
[05/07/2008 07:49:06 PM] Steve Koechle: i'm just bitter if you cant tell
[05/07/2008 07:51:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can tell.  we did talk about it today.  she expressed to me that she couldn't deal with it right now, but i assure you i will encourage her to hear you out and tell you how she feels.  she told me she blocked you but then you were upset so she unblocked you.
[05/07/2008 07:52:28 PM] Steve Koechle: i just told her she doesnt have to block me, just ask me to leave her alone
[05/07/2008 07:52:36 PM] Steve Koechle: i still respect her despite the situtation
[05/07/2008 07:53:05 PM] Steve Koechle: like i know she says i distract her then she spends the rest of the night talking to you, i really dont take up any of her time
[05/07/2008 07:53:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes but we are avoiding getting into a conversation now because there is so much work to be done.
[05/07/2008 07:54:16 PM] Steve Koechle: very well.... its just pointless to continue this conversation unless you have some really profound point to make other than whats already been said
[05/07/2008 07:55:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: I am not a very profound person.
