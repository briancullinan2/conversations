[08/14/2007 08:41:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: you might have to plug the USB into one computer and copy over some music, then plug it into the other laptop and copy it to there
[08/14/2007 08:41:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: then go back and forth until it is all copied if you need to
[08/14/2007 08:41:46 PM] Kelly King: oh
[08/14/2007 08:41:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: then log into itunes on the new computer and import all your music
[08/14/2007 08:41:58 PM] Kelly King: ok
