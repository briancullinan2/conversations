[05/17/2007 04:23:51 PM] Steve McVey: password management for a Web site? or for a personal password vault?
[05/17/2007 04:24:40 PM] BJCullinan: a passworf vault
[05/17/2007 04:24:48 PM] BJCullinan: enterprise level
[05/17/2007 04:24:55 PM] BJCullinan: one we can use for our company
[05/17/2007 04:25:22 PM] Steve McVey: by enterprise you mean 3 people
[05/17/2007 04:25:46 PM] BJCullinan: well, something we can expand to a very large database
[05/17/2007 04:25:54 PM] Steve McVey: are we talking like ms active directory?
[05/17/2007 04:25:55 PM] BJCullinan: so yeah 3 people now, but eventually 50
[05/17/2007 04:26:04 PM] BJCullinan: ms active directory?
[05/17/2007 04:26:07 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[05/17/2007 04:26:19 PM] Steve McVey: id and password management
[05/17/2007 04:26:33 PM] Steve McVey: single sign-on also
[05/17/2007 04:26:49 PM] Steve McVey: probably some open source out there
[05/17/2007 04:26:53 PM] Steve McVey: look up ldap
[05/17/2007 04:27:05 PM] BJCullinan: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory
[05/17/2007 04:27:06 PM] BJCullinan: ?
[05/17/2007 04:27:10 PM] BJCullinan: ah ldap
[05/17/2007 04:27:13 PM] BJCullinan: that i recognize
[05/17/2007 04:27:45 PM] BJCullinan: maybe not quite so extensive
[05/17/2007 04:27:49 PM] BJCullinan: well
[05/17/2007 04:27:59 PM] BJCullinan: not sure, i'll look into thanks
[05/17/2007 04:28:02 PM] Steve McVey: ok
[05/17/2007 04:28:23 PM] Steve McVey: your Winxp in a real orange folder?
[05/17/2007 04:28:34 PM] BJCullinan: maybe not log in stuff as much as just keeping track of passwords
[05/17/2007 04:28:48 PM] BJCullinan: yes its in a blue and orange folder
[05/17/2007 04:28:56 PM] BJCullinan: on my desk

[05/17/2007 04:29:14 PM] BJCullinan: i really just want an image of it
[05/17/2007 04:29:33 PM] BJCullinan: yeah thats really nice software
[05/17/2007 04:29:42 PM] BJCullinan: i started using that a few weeks ago
[05/17/2007 04:30:00 PM] Steve McVey: (Link: http://sdm.sourceforge.net/)http://sdm.sourceforge.net/
[05/17/2007 04:30:14 PM] BJCullinan: but maybe thats a little too user base, we need something database like, so maybe an implementation of ldap will work
[05/17/2007 04:30:18 PM] Steve McVey: (Link: http://www.bytecode.com.au/passwordsafeswt/)http://www.bytecode.com.au/passwordsafeswt/
[05/17/2007 04:31:15 PM] BJCullinan: the one we are using now, Password Manager XP, keeps corrupting our databases and we have to refer to backups
[05/17/2007 04:31:42 PM] Steve McVey: does it do what you need?
[05/17/2007 04:32:07 PM] BJCullinan: there are somethings about it that i don't like but yes
[05/17/2007 04:32:12 PM] BJCullinan: it gets the job done
[05/17/2007 04:32:24 PM] Steve McVey: commercial or free?
[05/17/2007 04:32:31 PM] BJCullinan: but it might be just as time consuming to restore databases all the time, then to just find a new one
[05/17/2007 04:32:33 PM] BJCullinan: commercial
[05/17/2007 04:32:39 PM] BJCullinan: supposedly they made a fix for it
[05/17/2007 04:33:18 PM] BJCullinan: and it had to do with our NetDrive software, but one of the things it did was it didn't reopen the file each time, it kept some sort of cache of the database
[05/17/2007 04:33:39 PM] Steve McVey: they should be interested in fixing it then
[05/17/2007 04:33:56 PM] BJCullinan: they did make a fix for it based on our recommendations
[05/17/2007 04:34:29 PM] BJCullinan: but i am just worried it isn't grabbing the new databases each time we open it
[05/17/2007 04:37:36 PM] BJCullinan: anywho the company is sending me a new case and video card
[05/17/2007 04:37:46 PM] BJCullinan: i'm gonna try out a ati x1900
[05/17/2007 04:37:56 PM] Steve McVey: good
[05/17/2007 04:38:21 PM] BJCullinan: and another coolermaster case, because the one i have now is so cramped i had to put a fan grate on the inside inorder to get it closed

[05/17/2007 04:44:29 PM] BJCullinan: we are going to put an events calendar on the band profile page, that would be a great way for you to let your friends know whats coming up
[05/17/2007 04:45:50 PM] BJCullinan: we installed the same engine that you tube uses for converting any video to flv so it can be played in the flash player
[05/17/2007 04:45:56 PM] BJCullinan: it was pretty pricy
[05/17/2007 04:49:57 PM] Steve McVey: cant register on jambonie

[10/05/2007 01:23:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i ordered a 50 footer
[10/05/2007 01:24:00 PM] Steve McVey: going from what to what?
[10/05/2007 01:24:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: digital out on media server around the room to digital in on receiver
[10/05/2007 01:24:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: the analog doesn't play real 5.1
[10/05/2007 01:25:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so even though everything is converted to analog eventually, there are multiple channels that can be expressed on the digital signal
[10/05/2007 01:25:06 PM] Steve McVey: i see, so comp will be on opposite wall fromprojector?
[10/05/2007 01:25:24 PM] Steve McVey: oh you mean stereo
[10/05/2007 01:25:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/05/2007 01:25:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i bought a optical cable
[10/05/2007 01:26:00 PM] Steve McVey: can you put all that stuff on the same wall?
[10/05/2007 01:26:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it will be higher quality then using the stereo cable
[10/05/2007 01:26:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: no room for receiver, its on opposite wall with the subwoofer and center speaker
[10/05/2007 01:26:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so computer and project are on the same wall, then receiver is across from it
[10/05/2007 01:27:08 PM] Steve McVey: cant move receiver? long speaker cable might be cheaper
[10/05/2007 01:29:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: all the couches are on the other wall

[10/05/2007 01:30:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i needed a DVI cable
[10/05/2007 01:30:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know the max length for a DVI signal is 5 meters
[10/05/2007 01:30:36 PM] Steve McVey: ok, cya

[10/05/2007 01:30:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: sry
[10/05/2007 01:30:56 PM] Steve McVey: 15 * 3 = 45 ft

[10/29/2007 03:45:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless i take all 2 math classes at once with like 2 CS classes and a capstone
[10/29/2007 03:47:35 PM] Steve McVey: well, that would be good.
[10/29/2007 03:47:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is too many classes at once
[10/29/2007 03:48:19 PM] Steve McVey: i mean fall would be good
[10/29/2007 03:48:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think the math minor is worth an extra semester
[10/29/2007 03:48:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and by taking calc 3, just like any 3rd class in the series, i will remember calculus forever

[02/20/2008 12:35:54 PM] Steve McVey: there?
[02/20/2008 12:36:24 PM] Steve McVey: That leaking we saw appears to be transmission fluid. Should take it to the mechanic and have them see where it is leaking.
[02/20/2008 12:36:37 PM] Steve McVey: If you run too low, the transmission will be shot.
[02/20/2008 12:37:17 PM] Steve McVey: There is a dipstick for transmission fluid, just like the oil one. Read your owners manual to see how to check it.
[02/20/2008 12:37:28 PM] Steve McVey: For some cars, you need to be in gear when checking.
[02/20/2008 12:53:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i will check it out today
[02/20/2008 12:53:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i take it back to midas or the other place?
[02/20/2008 12:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i get more transmission fluid right away?
[02/20/2008 12:54:09 PM] Steve McVey: i dont like midas....
[02/20/2008 12:54:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i take it back to the other place?
[02/20/2008 12:54:24 PM] Steve McVey: check the level and go get some if it's low.
[02/20/2008 12:54:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[02/20/2008 12:54:33 PM] Steve McVey: if it gets too low, disaster...
[02/20/2008 12:54:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: can i get a new car now?
[02/20/2008 12:54:51 PM] Steve McVey: i would go back to the mechanic who fixed the electrical

[02/20/2008 04:25:42 PM] Steve McVey: Check trans fluid when engine running and trans in Park. Good to run through gears once to make sure fluid is circulating
[02/20/2008 04:27:33 PM] Steve McVey: Must use the exact fluid recommended in owners manual
[02/20/2008 04:31:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i will try to find it

[02/20/2008 10:53:54 PM] Steve McVey: probably, but just want to keep an eye on it.
[02/20/2008 10:54:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: understood
[02/20/2008 10:54:10 PM] Steve McVey: it could get worse and leak faster
[02/20/2008 10:55:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: on another note my friend suggested a language learning software but it is quite costly, i can't remember the name but i might download a version to try it out, if it work might be worth looking into for improving all of our secondary languages
[02/20/2008 10:55:48 PM] Steve McVey: as in spoken language?
[02/20/2008 10:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[02/20/2008 10:56:17 PM] Steve McVey: there are hundreds of them out there
[02/20/2008 10:56:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: interesting method of learning, it is focused around making the user figure out what phrases mean by associating then with pictures
[02/20/2008 10:57:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: my friend is a computer scientist and knows probably 10 non-computer languages
[02/20/2008 10:57:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: mostly from this software

[07/31/2008 02:31:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i meant after defcon, maybe mom should come up with andrew in the camry because i don't think he has ever driven in the mountains, and then you come up in the van, and one of you can take my car back
[07/31/2008 02:32:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i guess i will still have to drive back to phoenix after defcon

[09/09/2008 10:41:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am taking the pci cards off the board and using PCI ribbon cables to connect them
[09/09/2008 10:42:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: and taking the power supply out of the casing, so everything is exposed and laying flat
[09/09/2008 10:43:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think it will look really cool
[09/09/2008 10:44:41 AM] Steve McVey: inside the table i presume
[09/09/2008 10:44:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes underneath the glass
[09/09/2008 10:45:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i will have another layer suspended to hold up the parts
[09/09/2008 10:45:49 AM] Steve McVey: maybe you should just modify a glass table
[09/09/2008 10:46:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am devising it so that there is only 1 piece that will have to be removed to make it look like a regular glass coffee table, and that is the bottom of it
[09/09/2008 10:46:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: buying a glass table would be more expensive, manufacturing costs and such, i want the finish the same color as the black table
[09/09/2008 10:47:13 AM] Steve McVey: im not so sure i would assume that
[09/09/2008 10:47:24 AM] Steve McVey: if they make 1000 glass tables and you make one...
[09/09/2008 10:47:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: besides i can get the glass without paying for it

[09/12/2008 11:38:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am thinking he has something running and that is causing the lag but he says he closes stuff down
[09/12/2008 11:38:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe the new drivers are causing the problem/
[09/12/2008 11:38:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[09/12/2008 11:38:31 AM] Steve McVey: im wondering if it is the tv doing DVR or something

[10/21/2008 12:29:22 PM] Steve McVey: latest firefox release?
[10/21/2008 12:30:00 PM] Steve McVey: 2.0.0.14?
[10/21/2008 12:30:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't banks has money to pay for good programmers?  all the crap they are doing to the site looks ridiculous.  i think they can't let go of the legacy code, and as a result it has become bloated
[10/21/2008 12:30:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: 3.0.3
[10/21/2008 12:30:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: been out for months
[10/21/2008 12:30:27 PM] Steve McVey: hmm... yeah im running latest
[10/21/2008 12:31:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should work for their website team
[10/21/2008 12:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: the chase site is beautiful
[10/21/2008 12:31:31 PM] Steve McVey: the problemis they have very strict versioning that takes lots of times to see changes
[10/21/2008 12:31:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: because of security?
[10/21/2008 12:32:37 PM] Steve McVey: and auditing, and general change control testing so it doesnt  crash
[10/21/2008 12:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think that adding a bunch of javascript ajax crap is really necessary when it comes to online banking
[10/21/2008 12:34:23 PM] Steve McVey: but its sooo cool
[10/21/2008 12:34:42 PM] Steve McVey: you do want a cool web site right?
[10/21/2008 12:38:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol right
[10/21/2008 12:39:00 PM] Steve McVey: actually it can save a lot of prcessing by not having to send a whole page
[10/21/2008 12:39:11 PM] Steve McVey: plus quicker of the user
[10/21/2008 12:39:17 PM] Steve McVey: if used correctly....
[10/21/2008 12:39:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know i am an advocate of using ajax, i just think the boa site has issues
[10/21/2008 12:40:00 PM] Steve McVey: probably
[10/21/2008 12:40:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: our server got hacked
[10/21/2008 12:40:13 PM] Steve McVey: if they run it the way they run their branches
[10/21/2008 12:40:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to go around and change all my passwords
[10/21/2008 12:40:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: since i use a password filler i figure i will just make them all randomly generated
[10/21/2008 12:40:35 PM] Steve McVey: which server?
[10/21/2008 12:40:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: acm server
[10/21/2008 12:40:45 PM] Steve McVey: running what?
[10/21/2008 12:41:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: ubuntu, mediawiki, wordpress, joomla, phpBB
[10/21/2008 12:41:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: we haven't figured out where they got in yet
[10/21/2008 12:42:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is russian or something, left a screen open with a bunch of taunts, and got the entire forum database, so my password is in there, just a simple run through a raindbow table and he could get in to all my bank accounts and google and everything
[10/21/2008 12:42:51 PM] Steve McVey: hmmm...
[10/21/2008 12:43:02 PM] Steve McVey: maybe you should have mutli passwords depending on risk
[10/21/2008 12:43:10 PM] Steve McVey: i use one for banks, etc
[10/21/2008 12:43:20 PM] Steve McVey: another for public sites
[10/21/2008 12:43:30 PM] Steve McVey: another for low-risk stuff
[10/21/2008 12:44:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, random is ok with me, i can even get the plugin for my phone in case i ever forget a password
[10/21/2008 12:44:14 PM] Steve McVey: i had my yahoo account hijacked, but the password was not the same for important stuff
[10/21/2008 12:44:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can always look it up on remote desktop
[10/21/2008 12:44:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i'll store the encrypted database on a thumbdrive
[10/21/2008 12:44:59 PM] Steve McVey: there are software pkgs that do password safe stuff

[10/27/2008 10:23:40 AM] Steve McVey: the old one likely just needs new capacitors
[10/27/2008 10:23:54 AM] Steve McVey: wanna try your hand at soldering some new ones in?
[10/27/2008 10:24:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: sure
[10/27/2008 10:24:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: we would have to go to frys and get replacements
[10/27/2008 10:24:28 AM] Steve McVey: yes, first you would have to find them inside the case
[10/27/2008 10:24:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: you think it is on the power supply in the monitor?
[10/27/2008 10:24:41 AM] Steve McVey: no idea
[10/27/2008 10:24:55 AM] Steve McVey: i just read some forums that said it is almost always capacitor failure
[10/27/2008 10:25:07 AM] Steve McVey: usually they are bulging or leaking
[10/27/2008 10:25:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just ordered a magnifying glass with a little stand and clips on the sides for soldering
[10/27/2008 10:26:06 AM] Steve McVey: might help unless you have to hold the whole thing
[10/27/2008 10:26:35 AM] Steve McVey: anyways ask andrew if he wants youto give it a try
[10/27/2008 10:26:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i can face it down towards the desk, there are like 5 pivoting points

[11/05/2008 11:30:40 AM] Steve McVey: i read that the biggest problem is capacitor failure
[11/05/2008 11:30:50 AM] Steve McVey: you could look and see if caps are bulging or leaking
[11/05/2008 11:31:04 AM] Steve McVey: how is the car?
[11/05/2008 11:31:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i would probably have to open it up voiding the warranty
[11/05/2008 11:31:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: the spare is a little flat, i am going to take it to get air today
[11/05/2008 11:31:41 AM] Steve McVey: alignment seem ok?

[11/05/2008 11:32:30 AM] Steve McVey: the costco warranty is in the glove box
[11/05/2008 11:32:39 AM] Steve McVey: you might read that to see what our options are

[11/05/2008 12:01:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: can we just buy 1?
[11/05/2008 12:01:48 PM] Steve McVey: probably, but usually you should replace them in pairs
[11/05/2008 12:01:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh ok
[11/05/2008 12:02:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but still cheaper then replacing all 4

[11/10/2008 12:17:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[11/10/2008 12:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe short circuit or terminator would be more mainstream
[11/10/2008 12:18:03 PM] Steve McVey: for sure, but that one started the whole robot sci-fi thing
[11/10/2008 12:18:56 PM] Steve McVey: Also, try Roby the Robot

[11/12/2008 12:26:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, not sure
[11/12/2008 12:26:51 PM] Steve McVey: just pulled out compnents and re-installed?
[11/12/2008 12:27:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, the little beep still happens before the post, kind of strange, i thought it was an error message but turns out it works
[11/12/2008 12:28:38 PM] Steve McVey: isnt it normal to beep once before post?
[11/12/2008 12:30:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought it usually beeps when its done with the mem check
[11/12/2008 12:31:06 PM] Steve McVey: i thought itwas after checking all the peripherals before you see anything on-scren. guess ill pay attention next time i reboot
[11/12/2008 12:33:19 PM] Steve McVey: the award bios site says:
[11/12/2008 12:33:20 PM] Steve McVey: The only AwardBIOS beep code indicates that a video error has occurred and the BIOS cannot initialize the video screen to display any additional information. This beep code consists of a single long beep followed by two short beeps. Any other beeps are probably a RAM (Random Access Memory) problems. 
 
[11/12/2008 12:33:38 PM] Steve McVey: was it award bios or ami?
[11/12/2008 12:35:28 PM] Steve McVey: Here is the ami code doc:

[12/11/2008 01:05:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wouldn't work in the Camry either, there is some weird locking device that i don't think was working right, i removed it and it worked so maybe it will work in the van too
[12/11/2008 01:06:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i also tore apart my phone earbuds and soldered them to the adapter, so now i can stream music off my server and play it in my car
[12/11/2008 01:06:35 PM] Steve McVey: maybe you should have gone into EE
[12/11/2008 01:07:13 PM] Steve McVey: figure out your capactors?
[12/11/2008 01:07:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: trying to figure out circuits is boring to me, and it has more math
[12/11/2008 01:07:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to call envision and try to order the part again
[12/11/2008 01:08:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: if that doesn't work i guess i will have to order some capacitors
[12/11/2008 01:08:29 PM] Steve McVey: i see
[12/11/2008 01:42:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am waiting for a tech person to call me back, i called and left a message but i haven't heard from them
[12/11/2008 01:43:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: their automated phone systems specifically says, "For technical support, or to order a replacement part for your television or monitor press 3"
[12/11/2008 01:43:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that sounds like exactly what i want to do
[12/11/2008 01:43:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't think of a part that you would need to replace that doesn't include opening the thing up
[12/11/2008 01:58:38 PM] Steve McVey: yu, especially if you are seeing bad capacitors

[12/16/2008 04:47:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember when i showed you the picture of the batman costume
[12/16/2008 04:47:27 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[12/16/2008 04:47:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i asked you about one of the materials, it looked like carbon fiber
[12/16/2008 04:47:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you said it looked like a sporting material like you know where to find it
[12/16/2008 04:48:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i need to get some, because the thickness of it will affect the way i carve the clay
[12/16/2008 04:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you know where i could find it?
[12/16/2008 04:48:23 PM] Steve McVey: nope
[12/16/2008 04:48:42 PM] Steve McVey: im sure thre are lots of internet sites that carry woven fabrics
[12/16/2008 04:49:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, where have you seen that kind of pattern before not on carbon fiber?
[12/16/2008 04:49:43 PM] Steve McVey: backpack?
[12/16/2008 04:49:45 PM] Steve McVey: jacket?
[12/16/2008 04:49:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: because looking at the picture again, the amount of reflection from the lighting looks like there is some kind of plastic coating
[12/16/2008 04:50:02 PM] Steve McVey: car interior?
[12/16/2008 04:54:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wouldn't even know where to begin to search for something like that
[12/16/2008 04:54:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i should just order carbon fiber
[12/16/2008 04:54:58 PM] Steve McVey: that should be cheap
[12/16/2008 04:55:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know how to find any alternative
[12/16/2008 04:55:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know carbon fiber would have the same appearance
[12/16/2008 04:55:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: what else has that pattern with a plastic finish over it?
[12/16/2008 04:56:13 PM] Steve McVey: raw carbon fiber doenst have a plastic finish

[01/07/2009 10:28:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: we have to figure out a way to bolt the rafters together
[01/07/2009 10:28:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is driving me nuts
[01/07/2009 10:30:09 AM] Steve McVey: Don't get your hopes too high on that one....
[01/07/2009 10:30:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tried looking in where the vent is, but it is completely enclosed, doesn't look like i will be able to see what arrangement the rafters are in, only other thing i can think of it to remove one of the fan fixtures and look through there
[01/07/2009 10:31:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: or ask
[01/07/2009 10:31:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: can't we bolt them ourselves?
[01/07/2009 10:32:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: if we know where they are can't we just sink the screws through the drywall and then cover it up with some putty and paint?
[01/07/2009 10:32:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: we can screw it in past the dry wall, or cut out a little square
[01/07/2009 10:33:09 AM] Steve McVey: I suspect what you are hearing is the floor above you shifting against the studs
[01/07/2009 10:34:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: then we can still find out the arrangement of studs in order to figure out if they can fill the entire ceiling with noise reducing insulation
[01/07/2009 10:36:11 AM] Steve McVey: I would ask if anyone else has seen that as an issue, if so what have they done?
[01/07/2009 10:37:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: ask people at the office?
[01/07/2009 10:37:18 AM] Steve McVey: yes

[01/27/2009 12:59:12 PM] Steve McVey: or fire fighters
[01/27/2009 01:00:04 PM] Steve McVey: or just raise tuition by 50%
[01/27/2009 01:00:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, maybe i won't have to pay for tuition, but as a republican i don't like paying other people
[01/27/2009 01:00:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't want taxes to go up, especially in flagstaff
[01/27/2009 01:01:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i care about my professors and the people i work with
[01/27/2009 01:01:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there is no guarantee that if they don't cut funds they will still keep their job
[01/27/2009 01:02:29 PM] Steve McVey: everyone with an interest protests cuts to their interest
[01/27/2009 01:02:35 PM] Steve McVey: but how do you solve the problem?
[01/27/2009 01:03:04 PM] Steve McVey: what will nau cut first if they have less money?

[01/27/2009 01:36:56 PM] Steve McVey: was there an official communication from the administration?
[01/27/2009 01:37:48 PM] Steve McVey: surely there is a way to aks the administration what  actions they would take if there were a budget cut
[01/27/2009 01:38:24 PM] Steve McVey: you can either be smart about these things and armed with facts or just be part of an angry mob 
[01/27/2009 01:38:38 PM] Steve McVey: angry mog = less work

[05/06/2009 11:57:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: Basically my options were, Dave moves out maybe a month in to the summer, and we go with no roommate for 2 months, or i find a new roommate to take up the full summer.  Mike is really enthusiastic about living there, and Dave wasn't, so i have to kick him out in order to fill all 3 months of summer
[05/06/2009 12:03:48 PM] Steve McVey: so dave is still there?
[05/06/2009 12:04:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: I told him he has until the 15th, but it doesn't sound like he found a place.  And Mike is expecting to move in the 15th, so i am not really sure what to do.
[05/06/2009 12:05:10 PM] Steve McVey: is mike flexible on that?
[05/06/2009 12:05:21 PM] Steve McVey: just cant kick dave (assuming he pays some rent)
[05/06/2009 12:05:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: not really, because he lives in an apartment
[05/06/2009 12:05:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, he said he would send a check for half the month
[05/06/2009 12:06:18 PM] Steve McVey: any way to accomodate all three for a week or two?
[05/06/2009 12:06:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure we could figure it out
[05/06/2009 12:07:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but for the last 3 months Dave has been talking about moving out and has assured me that he would be able to find a new place by the 15th
[05/06/2009 12:07:46 PM] Steve McVey: i see
[05/06/2009 12:08:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and now the time has come and he isn't doing anything about it, and hasn't started packing up, so he is pretty unreliable at this point
[05/06/2009 12:09:36 PM] Steve McVey: has he left everything in good shape?
[05/06/2009 12:10:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a spot on the carpet need the doorway that is pretty dark, and a hole in the dry wall from the futon, and another from the door despite the new doorstopper
[05/06/2009 12:11:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can patch those up easily enough, but the spot didn't come out with the cleaner when we tried
[05/06/2009 12:11:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: other then that i think it's in pretty good shape
[05/06/2009 12:11:42 PM] Steve McVey: ok, normal accidental stuff
[05/06/2009 12:11:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yup
[05/06/2009 12:12:22 PM] Steve McVey: would be nice to clean carpets and pain that room over the summer
[05/06/2009 12:12:40 PM] Steve McVey: when would mike move out?
[05/06/2009 12:12:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/06/2009 12:13:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably august 15th, i think he has plans to move in to an apartment then
[05/06/2009 12:13:26 PM] Steve McVey: that works well then
[05/06/2009 12:13:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yup
[05/06/2009 12:13:46 PM] Steve McVey: and did you set a price?
[05/06/2009 12:16:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i told him 400 would be ok, with the hope that Crystal will also be able to contribute to rent
[05/06/2009 12:16:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but she might not even be there for most the summer since i will be gone so much, she may stay in tucson with her mom
[05/06/2009 12:16:58 PM] Steve McVey: i see, when do you go get her?
[05/06/2009 12:17:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: 23rd at 9:06 AM
[05/06/2009 12:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should be back june 4th in time for keifer's wedding the 8th
