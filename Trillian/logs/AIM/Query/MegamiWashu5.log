[08/22/2007 02:25:59 PM] Kristina O'Conner: ive read about it on wiki but not seen it no
[08/22/2007 02:26:05 PM] Kristina O'Conner: it sounds real freaky
[08/22/2007 02:26:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: strange movie, kind of a comedy horror, its cool, i just watched it again

[08/22/2007 02:27:35 PM] Kristina O'Conner: oh yeah? my parents said stardust was awesome and if they say its good then yeah!
[08/22/2007 02:28:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i had a girlfriend that glowed
[08/22/2007 02:28:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: claire danes is pretty
[08/22/2007 02:28:15 PM] Kristina O'Conner: lmao
[08/22/2007 02:29:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: what classes did you have today?
[08/22/2007 02:29:48 PM] Kristina O'Conner: i had religion of the world, history 101 and history 109
[08/22/2007 02:29:56 PM] Kristina O'Conner: its kind of unique
[08/22/2007 02:30:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took religions
[08/22/2007 02:30:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: good class
[08/22/2007 02:30:10 PM] Kristina O'Conner: i forgot to take the basic history classes when i switched my majors
[08/22/2007 02:30:15 PM] Kristina O'Conner: yeah i like my teacher in this one
[08/22/2007 02:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: other religions are fascinating, but Christianity is the only one i could ever truly believe in
[08/22/2007 02:31:30 PM] Kristina O'Conner: Catholicism here (sp)
[08/22/2007 02:31:33 PM] Kristina O'Conner: which is the same
[08/22/2007 02:31:40 PM] Kristina O'Conner: i forgot why they're different
[08/22/2007 02:32:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: well yeah, the main difference is the hierarchy in Catholicism, and catholics believe salvation can only be achieved through the catholic church, where i believe that the trust and love of jesus will save you
[08/22/2007 02:33:33 PM] Kristina O'Conner:  That's not what ive been taught mind you but that can be the jist of it 
[08/22/2007 02:36:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: certainly not all catholics are the same, the bible is the important thing, its just times when the Vatican announces things like that, i get upset, or things like "10 commandments of driving", they use their power of writing blessed documents too frivolously 
[08/22/2007 02:36:27 PM] Kristina O'Conner: lol 'of driving'
[08/22/2007 02:36:33 PM] Kristina O'Conner: i know what yu mean
[08/22/2007 02:36:35 PM] Kristina O'Conner: *you
[08/22/2007 02:36:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: they really did announce a ten commandments of driving
[08/22/2007 02:37:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/19/news/vat.php)http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/19/news/vat.php
[08/22/2007 02:37:36 PM] Kristina O'Conner: lol i like the first one
[08/22/2007 02:38:54 PM] Kristina O'Conner: number 7 is the only one that is common sense and well said.
[08/22/2007 02:38:58 PM] Kristina O'Conner: short and to the point
[08/22/2007 02:40:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i hope its not meant to replace the original, i agree that sometimes documents should be written in the name of god to accommodate for the changing of times, but i think that a drivers ten commandments is a little over the top.  people are who they choose to be, although its a considerate gesture, only the person can decide to be good or bad, i think the Vatican should have more to worry about then a few angry tourists
[08/22/2007 02:40:59 PM] Kristina O'Conner: a lot of it is just good common sense
[08/22/2007 02:41:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: well exactly, and if people are still inconsiderate despite it being common sense, then god will be the final judge, there is no need for a powerful religious city like the Vatican to tell us how to drive
[08/22/2007 02:42:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if they have nothing better to do then write a 10 commandments for drivers in 100 different languages then what ever suits them
[08/22/2007 02:43:07 PM] Kristina O'Conner: you've got to remember, there's always those few people who need to be reminded once in a while
[08/22/2007 02:43:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but thing like that are the reason i don't participate in the catholic church
[08/22/2007 02:43:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it is nice to know you are catholic
[08/22/2007 02:43:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you go to church often?
[08/22/2007 02:44:05 PM] Kristina O'Conner: yes
[08/22/2007 02:44:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's good
[08/22/2007 02:44:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: what church do you go to?
[08/22/2007 02:44:37 PM] Kristina O'Conner: i go to a church in snottsdale
[08/22/2007 02:44:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol i live in snottsdale

[08/22/2007 02:49:45 PM] Kristina O'Conner: sure thing though itll be a while, dont like the cold places X D
[08/22/2007 02:49:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: should be a good winter i here, the ferns pollinated like crazy, maybe the ski season will last more then a week
[08/22/2007 02:50:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, the snow is tolerable if you have a nice warm condo and good friends to spend time with
[08/22/2007 02:51:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: nothing like coming back from class to a warm cup of hot chocolate
