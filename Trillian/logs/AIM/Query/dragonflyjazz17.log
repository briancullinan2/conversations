[09/10/2007 05:31:37 PM] Jesus: whats her name
[09/10/2007 05:31:40 PM] Jesus: is she hot?
[09/10/2007 05:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to her randomly after i said "rain sucks"
[09/10/2007 05:31:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: her name is Jill, and i think she is really cute
[09/10/2007 05:32:09 PM] Jesus: very cool
[09/10/2007 05:32:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: petite, shorter then me, cute face, really nice body, but her personality is really great too
[09/10/2007 05:33:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we started talking and i offered her a ride home because of the rain and she jumped right on the offer, if she has a boyfriend do you think she would have been more hesitant?
[09/10/2007 05:33:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we talked the entire car ride back to her place, and she seemed really enthusiastic about talking to me, and was very engaging in the conversation

[09/10/2007 05:38:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he is more a nerd, so its hard to talk to someone with him always asking what kind of computer they use
[09/10/2007 05:38:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: *he is a bigger nerd
