[09/17/2007 08:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: love songs mostly
[09/17/2007 08:31:50 PM] Jenna Schoch: though ive come to realize that you tend to tune just about anything out anyway....so it doesnt matter whats playing
[09/17/2007 08:31:52 PM] Jenna Schoch: lol
[09/17/2007 08:32:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: "all night long", "my love", "stuck on you", "love will conquer"

[09/17/2007 08:33:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might have missed you saying "i have to go" a few times, but that was intentional

[09/17/2007 08:37:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: Scorpio is the symbol of sex and Scorpios are passionate lovers, the most sensually energetic of all the signs.
[09/17/2007 08:37:29 PM] Jenna Schoch: haha, are you a scorpio?
[09/17/2007 08:37:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: my friend Leah to other day mentioned that part of a scorpios horoscope, but i guess you have to be having sex to be passionate about it
[09/17/2007 08:37:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[09/17/2007 08:37:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_%28astrology%29)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_%28astrology%29(Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_%28astrology%29)

[09/17/2007 08:38:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it's pretty accurate
[09/17/2007 08:38:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: except for not having sex
[09/17/2007 08:38:32 PM] Jenna Schoch: hmm wonder what mine says
[09/17/2007 08:39:10 PM] Jenna Schoch: he opposite sign to Taurus is (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio)Scorpio, and both signs are commonly known as the most sexually responsive of all zodiacal members. lol

[09/17/2007 08:40:35 PM] Jenna Schoch: interesting
[09/17/2007 08:41:45 PM] Jenna Schoch: but yeah, the whole thing sounds pretty accurate as well
[09/17/2007 08:41:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: the scorpios body?
[09/17/2007 08:41:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: or taurus bodies?
