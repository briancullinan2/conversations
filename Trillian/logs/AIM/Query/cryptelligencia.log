[09/27/2007 02:26:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol k
[09/27/2007 02:26:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: I've had that conversation with him thousands of times
[09/27/2007 02:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/27/2007 02:27:10 PM] Leah Dahmer: He has...really high standards. Unrealistic expectations.
[09/27/2007 02:27:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: its kind of hard to find good looking women that you can have an intelligent conversation with, so i guess i'm in the same boat he is
[09/27/2007 02:27:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah
[09/27/2007 02:27:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you and matt give all us CS nerds hope

[09/27/2007 02:28:47 PM] Leah Dahmer: All geeky and stunningly gorgeous
[09/27/2007 02:29:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, i'd love to meet them
[09/27/2007 02:29:15 PM] Leah Dahmer: Except that two of them are scorpios
[09/27/2007 02:29:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: And scorpio-scorpios don't usually work out.
[09/27/2007 02:29:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think scorpios get along with eachother
[09/27/2007 02:29:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: Nope :(
[09/27/2007 02:30:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: well either way, you'll have to introduce me
[09/27/2007 02:30:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you having a large wedding and inviting everyone? or just your close friends?
[09/27/2007 02:30:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: Well, we sort of wanted a small wedding to begin with
[09/27/2007 02:30:59 PM] Leah Dahmer: But then my mom got in on it
[09/27/2007 02:31:04 PM] Leah Dahmer: and now it's going to be a huge wedding.
[09/27/2007 02:31:06 PM] Leah Dahmer: Sigh.
[09/27/2007 02:31:16 PM] Leah Dahmer: So, we're going with it and inviting all the CS faculty and all of our friends :)

[09/27/2007 02:32:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: open bar?
[09/27/2007 02:32:16 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah :)
[09/27/2007 02:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am so there, i am taking a cab
[09/27/2007 02:33:44 PM] Leah Dahmer: haha
[09/27/2007 02:34:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: the summer after freshman year i went to my cousins wedding
[09/27/2007 02:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got 2 phone numbers and dances with a bangles cheerleader
[09/27/2007 02:35:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: haha, tell me about it. The atmosphere at weddings just lends itself to lovin'
[09/27/2007 02:35:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/27/2007 02:38:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: damn this October Fest is good
[09/27/2007 02:38:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: Is that the beer from Nimarcos?
[09/27/2007 02:38:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: no we bought a 12 pack
[09/27/2007 02:39:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i not pursue a girl because shes morman?
[09/27/2007 02:39:49 PM] Leah Dahmer: If she's a strict mormon, you probably shouldn't.
[09/27/2007 02:40:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: Mormon's are big into only dating and marrying other mormons.
[09/27/2007 02:40:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: what religion are you?
[09/27/2007 02:40:46 PM] Leah Dahmer: I was raised Catholic, but I'm sort of loosely Lutheran now.
[09/27/2007 02:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: good choice
[09/27/2007 02:41:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was raised catholic and i try to avoid the hierarchy 
[09/27/2007 02:41:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, me too.
[09/27/2007 02:41:42 PM] Leah Dahmer: There was an incident when I was about 12 years old
[09/27/2007 02:41:52 PM] Leah Dahmer: Me and my mom were sitting in church
[09/27/2007 02:42:02 PM] Leah Dahmer: and this guy came around to usher
[09/27/2007 02:42:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: and just reached down my mom's shirt, out of nowhere.
[09/27/2007 02:42:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: In church.
[09/27/2007 02:42:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: is your mom as hot as you?
[09/27/2007 02:42:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: lol
[09/27/2007 02:42:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: She doesn't dress like a 20-year-old.
[09/27/2007 02:43:11 PM] Leah Dahmer: So she really didn't provoke it or anything
[09/27/2007 02:43:23 PM] Leah Dahmer: Apparently this guy was retarted
[09/27/2007 02:43:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he has terets?  there are 2 different kinds, the verbal and the physical, a church would be a very accepting place for someone like him
[09/27/2007 02:43:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, but when we talked to the priest
[09/27/2007 02:43:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: apparently he'd had problems before
[09/27/2007 02:43:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: And turns out that particular church was seedy
[09/27/2007 02:44:15 PM] Leah Dahmer: That priest was coercing other priests and altar boys and stuff
[09/27/2007 02:44:29 PM] Leah Dahmer: Anyway, that's when we stopped going and became Lutherans.
[09/27/2007 02:44:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah the catholic church has some issues
[09/27/2007 02:45:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, I think the main problem is the celibacy
[09/27/2007 02:45:21 PM] Leah Dahmer: Priests should be ale to have healthy, sexual relationships
[09/27/2007 02:45:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: It would cut out the little boy crap altogether
[09/27/2007 02:46:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: priests don't even have to be celibate anymore, the college of cardinals released a doctrine addressing that issue way back then the whole sexual abuse thing started
[09/27/2007 02:47:29 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think it's mandated by the Vatican - it's frowned upon anyway.
[09/27/2007 02:48:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: Are you still Catholic?
[09/27/2007 02:48:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are a lot of priests that have married, we have one that practices at our church in phoenix
[09/27/2007 02:48:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i said i try to avoid the hierarchy, so i would much rather go to a non-denominational church
[09/27/2007 02:49:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, that's a good idea
[09/27/2007 02:50:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: unfortunately my mother still tries to coax me into going to church with her
[09/27/2007 02:50:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and of course if i get married someday it will be traditional, large catholic church wedding
[09/27/2007 02:50:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: They do have beautiful churches.
[09/27/2007 02:52:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Anyway, I'm going to go do my not-so-rigorous workout.
[09/27/2007 02:52:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: Are you coming to the meeting?
[09/27/2007 02:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[09/27/2007 02:53:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: not so rigorous?
[09/27/2007 02:53:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: Cool, see you then
[09/27/2007 02:54:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should work out together!
[09/27/2007 02:54:10 PM] Leah Dahmer: haha, no way. You're too rigorous.
[09/27/2007 02:54:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i missed my workout again today because my buddy blew me off
[09/27/2007 02:54:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you run? i could go for a run now
[09/27/2007 02:55:06 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, I'm gonna start running more often
[09/27/2007 02:55:21 PM] Leah Dahmer: My friend Lauren has been trying to drag me to the rec center track.
[09/27/2007 02:55:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok well we should work out together, i need more people to go with, or i won't go because i'm too lazy
[09/27/2007 02:56:03 PM] Leah Dahmer: heh, ok
[09/27/2007 02:56:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: Maybe tomorrow
[09/27/2007 02:56:14 PM] Leah Dahmer: Today I have my workout video
[09/27/2007 02:56:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might still go today
[09/27/2007 02:57:35 PM] Leah Dahmer: Cool, see ya tonight
[09/27/2007 02:57:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: c ya

[09/27/2007 09:53:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you believe in kissing on the first date?
[09/27/2007 09:54:52 PM] Leah Dahmer: It depends if it was a good date
[09/27/2007 09:55:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm

[09/27/2007 10:20:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't hear about it
[09/27/2007 10:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess he doesn't want me to come
[09/27/2007 10:20:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: He does, but he wanted to keep it on the DL from Chippy & Bozo and now EE guy
[09/27/2007 10:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: who the hell are these people?
[09/27/2007 10:20:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: Omg I had a "yarr" moment last night
[09/27/2007 10:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol what?
[09/27/2007 10:21:14 PM] Leah Dahmer: You'll pick up on the subtle nuances as you hang out with us more and more, heh
[09/27/2007 10:21:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: So one day when I was walking down the hall at work
[09/27/2007 10:21:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: I saw this girl dressed like a pirate
[09/27/2007 10:21:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: And so I got so excited and just yelled "YARR!"
[09/27/2007 10:22:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: And she gave me this meek laugh
[09/27/2007 10:22:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: like she'd had a bad day or something
[09/27/2007 10:22:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: and as I was smugly walking back to my office
[09/27/2007 10:22:46 PM] Leah Dahmer: I realized that she wasn't actually dressed like a pirate, and she just had the eyepatch on - like she probably had something wrong with her eye
[09/27/2007 10:23:02 PM] Leah Dahmer: I felt like an asshole.
[09/27/2007 10:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats so sad, what if she was hooking and had to wear it as male order for the money to support her child that she had when she was only 16
[09/27/2007 10:23:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: or that
[09/27/2007 10:23:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: such an asshole
[09/27/2007 10:23:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: haha
[09/27/2007 10:23:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol that's hilarious though
[09/27/2007 10:23:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, so that's a "Yarr" moment.
[09/27/2007 10:23:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would have done the same thing
[09/27/2007 10:24:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so explain who these people are
[09/27/2007 10:24:22 PM] Leah Dahmer: Chippie and Bozo are the "monkey" names we came up with annoying ACM people.
[09/27/2007 10:24:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: who is the blonde kid that has a kind of feminine voice and sits on the side?
[09/27/2007 10:24:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: Chippie is Joe Eagar
[09/27/2007 10:24:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: The redheaded kid who's allergic to EVERYTHING
[09/27/2007 10:24:49 PM] Leah Dahmer: And Bozo is Ryan Bohner
[09/27/2007 10:24:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: the redhead with the beard?
[09/27/2007 10:24:59 PM] Leah Dahmer: The beard...
[09/27/2007 10:25:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: Um he's the blender freak
[09/27/2007 10:25:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah he has rosey cheeks? and a high pitch voice?
[09/27/2007 10:25:22 PM] Leah Dahmer: He loves blender. If Blender was a chick, he'd cream his pants in front of her.
[09/27/2007 10:25:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yes
[09/27/2007 10:25:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, hes quite strange
[09/27/2007 10:25:43 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yes, he nerdstalked us
[09/27/2007 10:25:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: who is Bozo though?
[09/27/2007 10:25:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: So we're careful not to mention events to him
[09/27/2007 10:26:01 PM] Leah Dahmer: Bozo is Ryan Bohner
[09/27/2007 10:26:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: who's freaking annoying in every way
[09/27/2007 10:26:22 PM] Leah Dahmer: Has kind of a fro
[09/27/2007 10:26:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: glasses
[09/27/2007 10:26:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: really nerdy
[09/27/2007 10:26:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: was he there tonight
[09/27/2007 10:26:36 PM] Leah Dahmer: yeah
[09/27/2007 10:26:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: He was arguing about Norton 2008
[09/27/2007 10:26:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, yeah that guy is a dork
[09/27/2007 10:27:00 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah
[09/27/2007 10:27:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: He doesn't nerdstalk though
[09/27/2007 10:27:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but who is the red red head that sits next to the big guy and they hardly ever talk?
[09/27/2007 10:27:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: they kind of just sit and chuckle
[09/27/2007 10:27:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, they are so weird.
[09/27/2007 10:27:36 PM] Leah Dahmer: The brothers smell.
[09/27/2007 10:27:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: We call them, anyway.
[09/27/2007 10:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: they like don't even participate
[09/27/2007 10:27:44 PM] Leah Dahmer: I know!
[09/27/2007 10:27:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[09/27/2007 10:27:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're so funny
[09/27/2007 10:27:50 PM] Leah Dahmer: They've been to every single ACM meeting
[09/27/2007 10:27:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/27/2007 10:27:59 PM] Leah Dahmer: And they just sit there
[09/27/2007 10:28:04 PM] Leah Dahmer: No input, ever.
[09/27/2007 10:28:22 PM] Leah Dahmer: And they don't shower apparently
[09/27/2007 10:28:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: in every class I've been in with Jared (red head)
[09/27/2007 10:28:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: You could literally smell him from 3 rows away.
[09/27/2007 10:29:16 PM] Leah Dahmer: You know, it really seems like I sit around and gossip about these people
[09/27/2007 10:29:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: You tend to bring this trait out in me, heh
[09/27/2007 10:29:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[09/27/2007 10:29:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's fun to listen to you
[09/27/2007 10:30:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i try to give everyone a chance
[09/27/2007 10:30:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: or multiple chances
[09/27/2007 10:30:09 PM] Leah Dahmer: Oh totally.
[09/27/2007 10:30:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think its because i am totally a cynical person
[09/27/2007 10:30:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah. Everyone has they're flaws
[09/27/2007 10:30:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: it makes for good drama.
[09/27/2007 10:30:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so your gossip goes well with my cynicism
[09/27/2007 10:30:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[09/27/2007 10:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think i was invited to steve's party
[09/27/2007 10:31:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: hes all like "who told you?"
[09/27/2007 10:31:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: That's ok, he won't mind you there.
[09/27/2007 10:31:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: you can tell him I did
[09/27/2007 10:31:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i'm all like "i derived you were having a party from our final conversation. was i not supposed to know?"
[09/27/2007 10:31:47 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think he just didn't want our nerdstalkers there
[09/27/2007 10:32:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and hes like "good answer, ttyl"
[09/27/2007 10:32:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so he didn't answer my question
[09/27/2007 10:32:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: what if he thinks i am a stalker?
[09/27/2007 10:32:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: Well, he was there when we tracked down your number.
[09/27/2007 10:32:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be terrible, i'd have to cancel all my hot dates this weekend and paintballing on sunday in order to crash your party
[09/27/2007 10:34:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a backup date
[09/27/2007 10:34:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: *another backup date
[09/27/2007 10:34:36 PM] Leah Dahmer: What a scorpio :)

[10/14/2007 01:01:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: what?
[10/14/2007 01:02:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Can you tell Hentai Dave that since he's dropped me from his friend on facebook that I can't ask him this directly, but: There's an Algorithms Study Group this Wednesday in the Engineering Building. In the CS Lounge (room 105).
[10/14/2007 01:02:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: 5pm
[10/14/2007 01:03:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: you want me to confirm the validity of that?
[10/14/2007 01:03:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: Wha?
[10/14/2007 01:03:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: that wasn't a question
[10/14/2007 01:03:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: where is the question mark?
[10/14/2007 01:04:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: It was sort of a request/informative statement
[10/14/2007 01:04:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[10/14/2007 01:10:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: How you doing?
[10/14/2007 01:11:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine
[10/14/2007 01:11:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: you?
[10/14/2007 01:11:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Pretty good. Abe tells me that Portal is worth the money, so perhaps I will pick it up
[10/14/2007 01:12:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't you like half life 2?
[10/14/2007 01:12:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: or team fortress?
[10/14/2007 01:12:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: I don't like FPSes really.
[10/14/2007 01:12:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[10/14/2007 01:12:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: But I did love Vampire: Bloodlines
[10/14/2007 01:12:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: which was based on HL2
[10/14/2007 01:12:50 PM] Leah Dahmer: So I like the engine
[10/14/2007 01:12:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: just not really the FPS-style gameplay, I guess.
[10/14/2007 01:14:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i doesn't know anything about the study group
[10/14/2007 01:15:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he didn't add you on facebook
[10/14/2007 01:15:09 PM] Leah Dahmer: oh
[10/14/2007 01:15:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: Well, tell him there is a study group on wednesday
[10/14/2007 01:15:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: for when we get the review list
[10/14/2007 01:15:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok

[10/14/2007 01:16:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: Cool
[10/14/2007 01:16:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was painful
[10/14/2007 01:16:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: back breaking if you will
[10/14/2007 01:16:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: Well, thanks

[10/14/2007 01:18:23 PM] Leah Dahmer: No, not yet
[10/14/2007 01:18:29 PM] Leah Dahmer: But that would be aweshome.
[10/14/2007 01:38:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: eck was thinking about getting a couch
[10/14/2007 01:39:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: I heard about that! I thought that was just a ruse, though.
[10/14/2007 01:41:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think it was

[10/14/2007 02:16:03 PM] Leah Dahmer: why's that?
[10/14/2007 02:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: is his stuttering a symptom of autism?
[10/14/2007 02:16:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: That's not very nice, Brian.
[10/14/2007 02:16:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: :)
[10/14/2007 02:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: just wondering
[10/14/2007 02:16:35 PM] Leah Dahmer: No, it's turretts.
[10/14/2007 02:16:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes it is
[10/14/2007 02:16:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[10/14/2007 02:16:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Vocal tic
[10/14/2007 02:16:47 PM] Leah Dahmer: He doesn't have autism.
[10/14/2007 02:17:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i didn't know, both can cause stuttering
[10/14/2007 02:17:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: but "you might have to build a fan for your wireless card"
[10/14/2007 02:17:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: wtf is that?
[10/14/2007 02:17:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: heh, well a beast with 3 antennae does put out a lot of power.
[10/14/2007 02:18:07 PM] Leah Dahmer: He's actually come around very nicely
[10/14/2007 02:18:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: You should have seen him when we first met him - he was dorked out.
[10/14/2007 02:18:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but i've never even seen a router with fans on it (excluding economic size ones)
[10/14/2007 02:18:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: But lately, probably just from hanging around with us, he's become more social 
[10/14/2007 02:18:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: He dresses cooler, with his siggraph shirts.
[10/14/2007 02:19:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahaha hes such a dork
[10/14/2007 02:19:11 PM] Leah Dahmer: And he can be helpful most of the time.
[10/14/2007 02:19:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: Nah, he's cool. I would say he's one of the coolest out of all our little acm dorks.
[10/14/2007 02:19:37 PM] Leah Dahmer: Ryan Bohner, however.
[10/14/2007 02:19:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: He gets to me.
[10/14/2007 02:19:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[10/14/2007 02:19:59 PM] Leah Dahmer: He makes me think violent thoughts about him.
[10/14/2007 02:19:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: at least he plays video games
[10/14/2007 02:20:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: He needs to impress everyone all the time.
[10/14/2007 02:20:47 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's terrible. In my algorithms class with him
[10/14/2007 02:20:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: joe always thinks he's right, like when palmer or abe says something they probably know better then joe does and neither side actually goes to look it up on wikipedia to support their side
[10/14/2007 02:20:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: I was whining to Hentai Dave about how hard the homework was
[10/14/2007 02:21:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/14/2007 02:21:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: Dave doesn't like whining
[10/14/2007 02:21:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do it all the time, maybe you can get away with it because you have breasts
[10/14/2007 02:21:36 PM] Leah Dahmer: Well, he was whining himself.
[10/14/2007 02:21:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: Anyway
[10/14/2007 02:21:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: but just shoots me down
[10/14/2007 02:21:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyway
[10/14/2007 02:21:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: Ryan turns around and was like
[10/14/2007 02:22:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: "How can you think that was hard? I did that assignment in like 5 minutes. It was so easy."
[10/14/2007 02:22:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: Felt like embracing my inner Dahmer.
[10/14/2007 02:22:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[10/14/2007 02:22:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: And it's ridiculous how he manages to be so freaking arrogant
[10/14/2007 02:23:06 PM] Leah Dahmer: and yet, me & Dave tied on the highest test scores.
[10/14/2007 02:23:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: How can one guy manage to know so little but yet be so freaking arrogant?
[10/14/2007 02:23:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: ugh.
[10/14/2007 02:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[10/14/2007 02:24:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: embrace the inner Leah
[10/14/2007 02:24:33 PM] Leah Dahmer: My inner Dahmer!
[10/14/2007 02:24:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think computer science people are generally pretty arrogant
[10/14/2007 02:24:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: like Jeffrey Dahmer.
[10/14/2007 02:24:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: Not all of them!
[10/14/2007 02:24:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: dave is pretty fucking arrogant too
[10/14/2007 02:24:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, but he knows what he's talking about.
[10/14/2007 02:24:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: hentai dave that is
[10/14/2007 02:25:03 PM] Leah Dahmer: Most of the time.
[10/14/2007 02:25:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but that doesn't mean he should be condescending towards other people
[10/14/2007 02:25:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think he does it mostly in jest.
[10/14/2007 02:25:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: The way it comes across anyway.
[10/14/2007 02:25:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes, he does has a strange sense of humor
[10/14/2007 02:26:01 PM] Leah Dahmer: I like his dark humor.
[10/14/2007 02:26:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: I tend to have the same type of humor.
[10/14/2007 02:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, he is very dark, in general

[10/14/2007 02:29:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just wish i had someone to work out with
[10/14/2007 02:29:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: a spotter possibly
[10/14/2007 02:29:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: some sort of motivation to go frequently
[10/14/2007 02:29:36 PM] Leah Dahmer: Stop trying to hook up with me, sheesh.
[10/14/2007 02:29:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[10/14/2007 02:30:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: you work out right?
[10/14/2007 02:30:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yes. Alone in the solace of my living room. And with Lauren, occasionally.
[10/14/2007 02:30:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not trying to "hook up" with you
[10/14/2007 02:30:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: Boys and girls don't platonically work out together. Unless you're Abe.
[10/14/2007 02:31:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[10/14/2007 02:31:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: And he's pretty much 75% female anyway.
[10/14/2007 02:32:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you and Matt are great, and i wish you guys the best of relationships, he just never really engaged in conversation with me before, i hope there isn't some conflict in our personalities that i am unaware of
[10/14/2007 02:32:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: abe is an awesome guy
[10/14/2007 02:32:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he needs a woman
[10/14/2007 02:34:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: Matt thinks you want his woman.
[10/14/2007 02:34:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: So, naturally, he's a little hostile.
[10/14/2007 02:34:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahah really?
[10/14/2007 02:34:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: (Link: http://www.captainflour.com/photos/no_more_than_three/nmtt_20060622.jpg)http://www.captainflour.com/photos/no_more_than_three/nmtt_20060622.jpg
[10/14/2007 02:35:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[10/14/2007 02:37:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, please assure matt that although i think you're attractive, i only express myself around you guys because i am comfortable around friends, my intentions are only friendly, and my interactions with you are harmless
[10/14/2007 02:37:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that compliment at game night was purely because i know you personally, and i don't know keira knighly
[10/14/2007 02:38:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it still stands because you wear a lot less makeup then she does
[10/14/2007 02:38:25 PM] Leah Dahmer: And I don't ned my boobs airbrushed.
[10/14/2007 02:38:29 PM] Leah Dahmer: need*
[10/14/2007 02:39:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would love to see matt's stack smashing example
[10/14/2007 02:39:45 PM] Leah Dahmer: That was one very drunken night.
[10/14/2007 02:39:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i heard about it from lizard
[10/14/2007 02:39:52 PM] Leah Dahmer: Lizard?
[10/14/2007 02:39:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: ben
[10/14/2007 02:39:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: lizouwski
[10/14/2007 02:40:07 PM] Leah Dahmer: Ben....
[10/14/2007 02:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: works at CENS-IT with me
[10/14/2007 02:40:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: Oh his ACTUAL stack smashing.
[10/14/2007 02:40:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, that's pretty sweet.
[10/14/2007 02:40:42 PM] Leah Dahmer: You should have taken Computer Security this year
[10/14/2007 02:40:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there an alternate definition of stack smash?
[10/14/2007 02:41:03 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, there was a night we all got drunk and played charades
[10/14/2007 02:41:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: And Matt put "Smashing the Stack for fun and Profit" in the hat
[10/14/2007 02:41:21 PM] Leah Dahmer: and I drew it
[10/14/2007 02:41:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: So I acted out a stack.
[10/14/2007 02:41:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah i heard this story
[10/14/2007 02:41:46 PM] Leah Dahmer: and then I smashed myself. It was a had-to-be-there moment
[10/14/2007 02:43:06 PM] Leah Dahmer: Anyway, if you'd like to talk to Matt, his screen name is nobody289
[10/14/2007 02:43:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: I don't wanna pass on that message because it's awkward. For me.
[10/14/2007 02:44:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm, maybe you could think of a better way to say it?
[10/14/2007 02:45:56 PM] Leah Dahmer: Perhaps. I am not very good at dealing out information subtly.
[10/14/2007 02:47:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should just give it some time, wait until it's right, he will see i am harmless
[10/14/2007 02:48:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're the only female in CS, i think you're a fascinating person
[10/14/2007 02:48:10 PM] Leah Dahmer: Thanks, I work out.
[10/14/2007 02:48:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am currently trying to get closer to a mormon girl
[10/14/2007 02:49:09 PM] Leah Dahmer: Good luck :) They're elitist.
[10/14/2007 02:49:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i doubt it will go anywhere because of religious differences
[10/14/2007 02:49:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: They only date other mormons
[10/14/2007 02:49:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, it's a sad truth of this world.
[10/14/2007 02:49:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but i might still be in because she called me yesterday night and wanted me to come over and watch a movie with her
[10/14/2007 02:50:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: Bow-chicka-bow-wow
[10/14/2007 02:50:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: Sorry, I hang out with guys too much.
[10/14/2007 02:50:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[10/14/2007 02:51:00 PM] Leah Dahmer: anyway, I'm gonna go eat lunch. I'll catch you later
[10/14/2007 02:51:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what i thought at first, but it fell through, she isn't making much of an effort to find time to hang out with me, but i was surprised

[10/14/2007 07:26:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: gotta do a flyer

[10/14/2007 07:26:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is blender?
[10/14/2007 07:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: joe was talking about it
[10/14/2007 07:26:59 PM] Leah Dahmer: yeah, joe eagar's gonna do a demo on blender
[10/14/2007 07:27:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is blender?
[10/14/2007 07:27:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: 3d modelling, I think
[10/14/2007 07:27:35 PM] Leah Dahmer: I've never actually used it
[10/14/2007 07:27:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, i will have to come up with some annoying difficult questions for him
[10/14/2007 07:28:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: he would stutter on every word
[10/14/2007 07:28:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: mean!
[10/14/2007 07:28:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha i know
[10/14/2007 07:30:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: I need to hone your gossiping skilles
[10/14/2007 07:30:14 PM] Leah Dahmer: skills*
[10/14/2007 07:30:16 PM] Leah Dahmer: because you suck
[10/14/2007 07:30:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i gave away dave's nickname?
[10/14/2007 07:30:51 PM] Leah Dahmer: Things the person can't help is most certainly not on the list of acceptable ridicule!
[10/14/2007 07:31:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: ha can help it
[10/14/2007 07:31:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: no, because you make fun of joe's stuttering
[10/14/2007 07:31:21 PM] Leah Dahmer: he can not!
[10/14/2007 07:31:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/14/2007 07:31:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's impulsive. You meanie.
[10/14/2007 07:31:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: by not talking
[10/14/2007 07:31:37 PM] Leah Dahmer: Make fun of him for nerd-stalking or being annoying
[10/14/2007 07:31:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry, it's not gossip, i am just a terribly cynical person
[10/14/2007 07:31:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: *AAAAIIIINNNNNnhh*
[10/14/2007 07:31:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: that's the buzzer noise.
[10/14/2007 07:32:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: That's not cynical. That's just horribly mean.
[10/14/2007 07:32:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: Nerdstalking is ok. Wearing his blender shirt every day is ok.
[10/14/2007 07:32:30 PM] Leah Dahmer: Stuttering, not ok.
[10/14/2007 07:33:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: MAN! You should really attend my gossip workshop.
[10/14/2007 07:33:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is my cynicism, but i understand your point, i didn't mean to make fun
[10/14/2007 07:35:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i didn't mean to make fun earlier when i suggested it was a symptom of autism, there are many disabilities that cause stuttering
[10/14/2007 07:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone suggested to me that it was autism the other day when it was brought up
[10/14/2007 07:35:28 PM] Leah Dahmer: Hush you mean-heart!
[10/14/2007 07:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i told them that it couldn't be
[10/14/2007 07:35:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you cleared that up, i didn't realize it was terrets
[10/14/2007 07:36:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: so thank you
[10/14/2007 07:36:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, he has muscle spasms if you watch carefully.
[10/14/2007 07:36:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't notice
[10/14/2007 07:37:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have no intention of gossiping, your workshop won't be necessary, enough of it pours out of you i find it all amusing
[10/14/2007 07:38:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: But you're committing a social faux pas and I'm trying to prevent you from continuing.
[10/14/2007 07:38:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: If you make fun of Joe's stuttering in public, you will most certainly be shot down and seen as a meanie.
[10/14/2007 07:39:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry, my comment was uncalled for and out of character
[10/14/2007 07:39:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: won't happen again
[10/14/2007 07:40:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: Sheesh, I'm not your mommy. Just trying to help.

[10/14/2007 07:40:41 PM] Leah Dahmer: So how is your latter day saint?
[10/14/2007 07:41:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: haven't talked to her
[10/14/2007 07:42:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll give it time
[10/14/2007 07:42:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't want to be to persistent in trying to find time to spend with her
[10/14/2007 07:43:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: I see. Have you seen Big Love?
[10/14/2007 07:43:13 PM] Leah Dahmer: Speaking of LDS
[10/14/2007 07:44:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[10/14/2007 07:44:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: the mormon church doesn't support polygamy anymore
[10/14/2007 07:45:11 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, I know. But the show is great!
[10/14/2007 07:45:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: And they really do still exist in sects in Utah
[10/14/2007 07:45:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: And here, actually.
[10/14/2007 07:46:26 PM] Leah Dahmer: A group of them live out near my dad's plot of land in Utah
[10/14/2007 07:47:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: They're the nicest people when you have to interact with them, but they sort of hide away in their houses for long periods of time.
[10/14/2007 07:47:11 PM] Leah Dahmer: They don't like to be seen in public, really.
[10/14/2007 07:48:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are veyr cult like
[10/14/2007 07:49:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example they don't talk about the church unless you are a member
[10/14/2007 07:50:07 PM] Leah Dahmer: mormons in general or polygamists?
[10/14/2007 07:50:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: mormons
[10/14/2007 07:50:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are even different levels of the church where you are allowed to know different things
[10/14/2007 07:50:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they have mormon underwear
[10/14/2007 07:50:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: LOL!
[10/14/2007 07:50:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: that they have to wear in the shower
[10/14/2007 07:50:50 PM] Leah Dahmer: what?! that cant be true
[10/14/2007 07:50:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's true
[10/14/2007 07:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: they can only take it off to change it
[10/14/2007 07:51:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is the more hardcore mormons
[10/14/2007 07:51:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: a lot of them don't do that anymore
[10/14/2007 07:51:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they are only allowed to drink pepsi
[10/14/2007 07:51:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: because one of their higher members owns part of it
[10/14/2007 07:51:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: that's not true, they're not allowed any caffeine
[10/14/2007 07:52:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: that is so weird!
[10/14/2007 07:52:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: the hardcore one's won't drink caffeine, but not all pepsi products are caffinated 
[10/14/2007 07:53:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are worse then greek orthodox
[10/14/2007 07:54:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and more exclusive then the catholic church
[10/14/2007 07:54:43 PM] Leah Dahmer: But don't LDS people go door-to-door?
[10/14/2007 07:54:57 PM] Leah Dahmer: That seems less cult-like than catholics, anyway
[10/14/2007 07:55:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: they do go door to door, they try to get your attention by presenting the bible, because it's better known, but the book of mormon is pretty different
[10/14/2007 07:56:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i actually have a book of mormon
[10/14/2007 07:57:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: how come?
[10/14/2007 07:57:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: found it
[10/14/2007 07:57:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: dave found it
[10/14/2007 07:57:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: the biggest problem i have with the mormon religion is they follow the book of mormon so closely, when it was written based on the story of jesus from the point of view of 1 man
[10/14/2007 07:58:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: the bible is supposed to be a compilation of all the points of view of all the apostles
[10/14/2007 07:59:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: 12 different view that intertwine is a lot less likely to have room for error, then the views of 1 man
[10/14/2007 07:59:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: Very true
[10/14/2007 07:59:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and just like the catholics they believe salvation only comes through their church
[10/14/2007 08:00:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: those religions bother me, i believe salvation comes through your faith in god, not the name of the church you attend
[10/14/2007 08:00:13 PM] Leah Dahmer: I agree
[10/14/2007 08:00:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: Religious is a very personal journey
[10/14/2007 08:00:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: Not a tyranny
[10/14/2007 08:00:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: Religion*
[10/14/2007 08:00:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think that when jesus told the people the church would be rebuilt in 3 days that he had any idea what to call it, i think that was our doing
[10/14/2007 08:01:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you christian then?
[10/14/2007 08:01:34 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, it seems really arrogant, even for the savior, to call a religion after yourself.
[10/14/2007 08:01:44 PM] Leah Dahmer: I'm loosely Christian
[10/14/2007 08:02:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about matt?
[10/14/2007 08:02:02 PM] Leah Dahmer: I attend a Lutheran church, but I'm mostly going out of requirement to get married there.
[10/14/2007 08:02:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: His whole family is Lutheran. He's more religious than I am.
[10/14/2007 08:03:13 PM] Leah Dahmer: I was raised Catholic, but my family had a falling out with the Catholic church a while back.
[10/14/2007 08:03:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was raised catholic, i had church school every sunday after mass, i have friends that have been a good influence on me, and i remain strongly religious, but i've moved away from the hierarchy of the catholic church
[10/14/2007 08:04:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you every have any questions, please feel free to ask, richard and i have discussed many things with our agnostic friends, and we can defend our point of view quite well
[10/14/2007 08:04:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is never easy being christian when there are so many people around you tearing at your faith
[10/14/2007 08:05:08 PM] Leah Dahmer: When you're the biggest, you're the biggest target.
[10/14/2007 08:05:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's true
[10/14/2007 08:05:50 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think I would most likely use the cliche:
[10/14/2007 08:06:00 PM] Leah Dahmer: I'm Spiritual, but not religious.
[10/14/2007 08:06:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that is pretty cliche
[10/14/2007 08:06:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: I tend to use religion as a means to reassure myself that there is something greater than I out there
[10/14/2007 08:06:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: and that all of my hard work to be so morally strict
[10/14/2007 08:06:43 PM] Leah Dahmer: is worth something in the end
[10/14/2007 08:06:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: as long as you don't start practicing reiki, we can remain friends
[10/14/2007 08:07:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: ahahaha
[10/14/2007 08:07:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: I went to kung-fu and they offered that class there
[10/14/2007 08:07:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i believe in the body emitting a positive energy, but for the most part i think spiritualists are full of shit
[10/14/2007 08:08:07 PM] Leah Dahmer: Though there is something to be said about chi.
[10/14/2007 08:08:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: When you walk into a place, you sort of "feel" whether it's good or bad for you.
[10/14/2007 08:08:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: Whether the crowd receives you well, how your body chemistry reacts.
[10/14/2007 08:08:52 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's sort of new-agey, but it's hard to deny.
[10/14/2007 08:09:05 PM] Leah Dahmer: When I walk into keggers, I know I'm in the wrong environment for me to function.
[10/14/2007 08:09:31 PM] Leah Dahmer: I don't feel comfortable and my body just feels different.
[10/14/2007 08:09:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i can understand that, i know there must be some time of energy around all of us, sort of like a magnetic field around every living thing
[10/14/2007 08:10:13 PM] Leah Dahmer: There are a lot of great things you can learn from different religions
[10/14/2007 08:10:20 PM] Leah Dahmer: Spiritualists can teach you how to relax
[10/14/2007 08:10:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have never seen someone heal a person of cancer with a ball of light
[10/14/2007 08:10:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have however heard people claim such things
[10/14/2007 08:10:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: Actually, it does happen!
[10/14/2007 08:11:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't believe it
[10/14/2007 08:11:03 PM] Leah Dahmer: My mom is an oncologist
[10/14/2007 08:11:32 PM] Leah Dahmer: She says that when cancer patients are surrounded by loving family, with flowers and children and hugs
[10/14/2007 08:11:40 PM] Leah Dahmer: they heal better than people who battle cancer alone.
[10/14/2007 08:11:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i totally believe in miracles, don't get me wrong
[10/14/2007 08:11:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: Maybe you can't entirely heal cancer with a ball of light, but you can sure influence it.
[10/14/2007 08:12:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am saying i don't believe a person can deny physics and emit physical light from their hands in order to heal someone
[10/14/2007 08:12:53 PM] Leah Dahmer: Of course not, but they're just using that as a vision in your mind.
[10/14/2007 08:13:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have heard spiritualists claim they can do it
[10/14/2007 08:13:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: Eh, they're insane.
[10/14/2007 08:14:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what i think
[10/14/2007 08:14:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: this mormon guy doesn't look very happy in the show
[10/14/2007 08:14:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: big love?
[10/14/2007 08:14:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/14/2007 08:15:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: is he not mormon?
[10/14/2007 08:15:09 PM] Leah Dahmer: The older guy or the main guy?
[10/14/2007 08:15:11 PM] Leah Dahmer: bill paxton?
[10/14/2007 08:15:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess he doesn't have to be to be a polygomist 
[10/14/2007 08:15:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/14/2007 08:15:27 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's funny, actually.
[10/14/2007 08:15:38 PM] Leah Dahmer: You see him interact with his three wives
[10/14/2007 08:15:54 PM] Leah Dahmer: and you actually feel *sorry* for him for having to deal with three separate families.
[10/14/2007 08:16:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: polygamy is wrong
[10/14/2007 08:16:06 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's such a cliche guy fantasy
[10/14/2007 08:16:10 PM] Leah Dahmer: to have more than one girl
[10/14/2007 08:16:19 PM] Leah Dahmer: But in reality, it sucks!
[10/14/2007 08:16:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's sort of reassuring to see that :)
[10/14/2007 08:16:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahah, i can't even find one girl that's right for me, i doubt i could find 3
[10/14/2007 08:16:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not my fantasy
[10/14/2007 08:17:00 PM] Leah Dahmer: Yeah, mine either, lol.
[10/14/2007 08:17:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: Three cheers for monogamy!
[10/14/2007 08:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't stand modeling
[10/14/2007 08:19:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's the worst type of vertex graphics
[10/14/2007 08:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like mapping though, create worlds of objects, instead of each individual one
[10/14/2007 08:19:22 PM] Leah Dahmer: Are you looking at blender?
[10/14/2007 08:19:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah

[10/22/2007 01:13:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got pretty defensive pretty quick, did some ex-boyfriend dump you for a hotter, younger Mac?
[10/22/2007 01:14:46 PM] Leah Dahmer: You called me gay pretty quick.
[10/22/2007 01:15:10 PM] Leah Dahmer: Also, people don't understand intonation over the internet.
[10/22/2007 01:15:17 PM] Leah Dahmer: One of the flaws of not speaking face to face.
[10/22/2007 01:15:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: the phrase is ambiguous, obviously you can't be gay if you're getting married to someone of the opposite sex
[10/22/2007 01:15:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't think it was a good idea to respond with more negativity
[10/22/2007 01:15:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: So why use it if the phrase is ambiguous?
[10/22/2007 01:16:13 PM] Leah Dahmer: You know, all the ACM officers were mighty close to banning you for trolling.
[10/22/2007 01:17:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i don't think the quality of someone's humor is grounds for banning someone
[10/22/2007 01:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys would fit in with counterstrike server admins
[10/22/2007 01:18:00 PM] Leah Dahmer: Trolling is legit grounds for banning.
[10/22/2007 01:18:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: my points is, everyone says things that could be considered offensive
[10/22/2007 01:18:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: what if my father died in a car accident?
[10/22/2007 01:18:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and matt was being condescending
[10/22/2007 01:18:39 PM] Leah Dahmer: You were being hurtful and disrespectful
[10/22/2007 01:18:48 PM] Leah Dahmer: And we all find it annoying.
[10/22/2007 01:18:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so we all say things that are negative or offensive
[10/22/2007 01:18:58 PM] Leah Dahmer: So either cut it out, or get new friends.
[10/22/2007 01:19:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: real nice
[10/22/2007 01:20:14 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think friendship is based on respect.
[10/22/2007 01:20:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: And if you don't have respect for someone else, you can't be friends. period.
[10/22/2007 01:20:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so making a situation worse is how you deal with friends?
[10/22/2007 01:21:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice job creating a double standard here
[10/22/2007 01:21:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you criticized my negative post, then posted something negative yourself
[10/22/2007 01:22:35 PM] Leah Dahmer: I'm not going to have this childish argument with you. You can either apologize and we can put it behind us, or we can go our separate ways.

[12/12/2007 04:41:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i also think it might be a little difficult to recruit people, if we can't even give the existing participants a little slack
[12/12/2007 04:42:15 PM] Leah Dahmer: It's actually been quite a semester for us
[12/12/2007 04:42:24 PM] Leah Dahmer: We've had a lot of new people come to meetings lately
[12/12/2007 04:43:12 PM] Leah Dahmer: I think the biggest reason why I was so offended by your attack because I thought we were becoming good friends.
[12/12/2007 04:43:18 PM] Leah Dahmer: And then you sort of attacked me out of nowhere.
[12/12/2007 04:43:55 PM] Leah Dahmer: If you were a Ryan Bohner, I would just simply ignore you. And probably poke fun at you.

[12/12/2007 04:46:23 PM] Leah Dahmer: Makes sense now. It was sort of a misunderstanding that gradually festered because nobody wanted to deal with it.

[01/25/2008 12:06:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could let you borrow it
[01/25/2008 12:06:59 PM] Leah Shanker: Though it's probably too gritty.
[01/25/2008 12:07:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean so you don't have to download it
[01/25/2008 12:07:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: just pick your format i have tons of conversion tools
[01/25/2008 12:08:19 PM] Leah Shanker: just an img file would be cool

[01/27/2008 06:02:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you like fantasy movies at all
[01/27/2008 06:02:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's like an action adventure comedy romance
[01/27/2008 06:03:49 PM] Leah Shanker: yay!
[01/27/2008 06:04:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get chills when i watch it
[01/27/2008 06:04:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it's so sensational
[01/27/2008 06:05:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you seen the fountain?
[01/27/2008 06:05:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i asked you that before

[01/28/2008 10:15:44 AM] Leah Shanker: hey brian
[01/28/2008 10:15:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am adding 3D to slagcore
[01/28/2008 10:16:08 AM] Leah Shanker: lol, seriously?
[01/28/2008 10:16:13 AM] Leah Shanker: you should talk to murphy
[01/28/2008 10:16:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/28/2008 10:16:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: did he already do it?
[01/28/2008 10:16:34 AM] Leah Shanker: He did it for JavaCore
[01/28/2008 10:16:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[01/28/2008 10:16:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[01/28/2008 10:16:57 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it was super impressive. When I took Vdub with him, all his projects were in 3d.
[01/28/2008 10:19:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: see that's what i want to do
[01/28/2008 10:19:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i will just write it myself instead of trying to port his code
[01/28/2008 10:19:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't find java core
[01/28/2008 10:19:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: it will be good calc and trig practice
[01/28/2008 10:20:39 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, another way you can do it is write all the game logic in slagcore and call OpenGL libraries to draw the screen
[01/28/2008 10:21:04 AM] Leah Shanker: Or, you don't even have to use SlagCore, really.
[01/28/2008 10:21:17 AM] Leah Shanker: I knew people in Vdub who wrote games in straight Java
[01/28/2008 10:21:27 AM] Leah Shanker: it's more time-consuming, but he doesn't take off points.
[01/28/2008 10:27:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was just going to extend a few classes like rect and quad that uses a vector3
[01/28/2008 10:28:25 AM] Leah Shanker: cool,  can't wait to see what you come up with
[01/28/2008 10:28:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: then use a view3D class to control scaling and stuff, so my game would call view3d draw

[01/29/2008 04:17:43 PM] Leah Shanker: That's ok, I'm playing them on Matt's mythbox, which reads .iso formats
[01/29/2008 04:17:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: they would take less time to download
[01/29/2008 04:18:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: or i could set you up a vlc server
[01/29/2008 04:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is supported by myth i believe

[01/29/2008 04:19:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think it is weird to watch a cheesy movie just because there is an attractive actor/actress in it?
[01/29/2008 04:19:38 PM] Leah Shanker: Nope :) I watch any and everything with Jude Law
[01/29/2008 04:20:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got some random movie just because it had claire danes
[01/29/2008 04:20:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Cool. I'm the same way with Audrey Tatou
[01/29/2008 04:21:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i think shes pretty, and a pretty good actress too
[01/29/2008 04:23:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know reese witherspoon is actually a cool person

[01/30/2008 10:16:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: how many pages is your assignment 1?
[01/30/2008 10:17:02 PM] Leah Shanker: He will slaughter you for whining :)
[01/30/2008 10:17:07 PM] Leah Shanker: three, including a cover page.

[01/30/2008 10:17:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: where are the instructions for cover page?
[01/30/2008 10:17:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: 2 full pages, no cover page
[01/30/2008 10:17:54 PM] Leah Shanker: submission guidelines
[01/30/2008 10:17:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so same i guess

[01/30/2008 10:18:23 PM] Leah Shanker: but I agree with you, this was a tough assignment
[01/30/2008 10:18:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Eck doesn't give out teeny weeny homework assignments
[01/30/2008 10:18:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: this wasn't so hard
[01/30/2008 10:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but scheme is
[01/30/2008 10:18:52 PM] Leah Shanker: It involved a lot of researching
[01/30/2008 10:18:56 PM] Leah Shanker: for me, anyway.
[01/30/2008 10:19:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i just mean in contrast to the 400 level classes
[01/30/2008 10:19:21 PM] Leah Shanker: well, 396 is a core class
[01/30/2008 10:19:29 PM] Leah Shanker: while most of the 400 classes aren't.
[01/30/2008 10:19:35 PM] Leah Shanker: core classes are generally just harder
[01/30/2008 10:19:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: operating systems, computer networks, virtual worlds, xml study
[01/30/2008 10:20:19 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, OS is the only core class in that gorup

[02/02/2008 04:46:20 PM] Leah Shanker: and then it just sat in there for a long time
[02/02/2008 04:46:22 PM] Leah Shanker: rotting
[02/02/2008 04:46:42 PM] Leah Shanker: Finally the smell got so bad it wafted into my room and we found the evidence...his cheese.

[02/04/2008 11:08:21 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe & DrP
[02/04/2008 11:08:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can always take it again with me another semester!
[02/04/2008 11:08:57 PM] Leah Shanker: I am very much considering it.
[02/04/2008 11:09:04 PM] Leah Shanker: And this is the last week for me to drop without a W.
[02/04/2008 11:10:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's up to you, but you won't take any shit from anyone priciples is really hard
[02/04/2008 11:17:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am almost done with part 1
[02/04/2008 11:17:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: it only took me about 2 hours so far
[02/04/2008 11:18:05 PM] Leah Shanker: That's awesome! Took me way more than that.
[02/04/2008 11:18:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i spent lots of time on steamroller before he assigned any homework
[02/04/2008 11:18:46 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah - the huge hump is the initial approach.
[02/04/2008 11:18:53 PM] Leah Shanker: Part I really took a long time for me
[02/04/2008 11:18:58 PM] Leah Shanker: but parts 2 and 3 were really easy
[02/04/2008 11:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: good to hear, i think i will have no problem finishing it up this week
[02/04/2008 11:19:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have a test wednesday and kafei homework should be really easy
[02/04/2008 11:19:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: what are you plans for that?
[02/04/2008 11:19:59 PM] Leah Shanker: I haven't started it yet, but I plan to spend 3 hours on it on Wednesday
[02/04/2008 11:20:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt's finished with it already and it didn't take him very long.
[02/04/2008 11:20:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean implementation wise, are you just going to read in the input, parse it a little bit, then launch the appropriate command?
[02/04/2008 11:20:56 PM] Leah Shanker: it's even easier than that
[02/04/2008 11:21:09 PM] Leah Shanker: You can just take in the args, take in the command
[02/04/2008 11:21:14 PM] Leah Shanker: and send it to exec()
[02/04/2008 11:21:24 PM] Leah Shanker: or, act like a shell in the way that
[02/04/2008 11:21:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example i was going to check to see if a & is on the end, and use the fork() command, otherwise use wait(), and if the program being launched is in the PATH then start it with system()
[02/04/2008 11:22:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Yup
[02/04/2008 11:22:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah maybe i am making it too complicated, he just made it sound like he wanted us to use all the commands
[02/04/2008 11:22:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: kind of a dumb project
[02/04/2008 11:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: not useful at all
[02/04/2008 11:22:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: a c++ hello world would have been more educational
[02/04/2008 11:22:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I'm thinking of it as an axcuse to relearn C.
[02/04/2008 11:22:39 PM] Leah Shanker: haha
[02/04/2008 11:22:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i suck at pointers
[02/04/2008 11:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but other then that c++ is pretty easy compared to some programming languages
[02/04/2008 11:23:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, the errors are very unhelpful
[02/04/2008 11:23:34 PM] Leah Shanker: If you run into logic or compile errors
[02/04/2008 11:23:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol i love c++ errors
[02/04/2008 11:23:43 PM] Leah Shanker: pretty much you have to go line by line to figure out what you did.
[02/04/2008 11:23:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Sucks compared to Java errors.
[02/04/2008 11:23:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/04/2008 11:24:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love how if you forget a semicolon at the end, it gives you an error completely wrong
[02/04/2008 11:24:18 PM] Leah Shanker: lol seriously
[02/04/2008 11:25:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i am off

[02/06/2008 06:53:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you use a define or a letrec?
[02/06/2008 06:53:23 PM] Leah Shanker: eval is the key
[02/06/2008 06:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: shizer
[02/06/2008 06:54:01 PM] Leah Shanker: he gave it to us in the notes
[02/06/2008 06:54:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know i completely fucked up and didn't take notes that day
[02/06/2008 06:54:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was like the last thing he mentioned
[02/06/2008 06:54:30 PM] Leah Shanker: lemme give you the notes

[02/06/2008 06:55:45 PM] Leah Shanker: (define addit (lambda (num) (+5 num)))
[02/06/2008 06:55:49 PM] Leah Shanker: This is nothing but a list, right?
[02/06/2008 06:55:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to do that, i will figure it out eventually
[02/06/2008 06:56:03 PM] Leah Shanker: pfft, why struggle?
[02/06/2008 06:56:13 PM] Leah Shanker: So now what?
[02/06/2008 06:56:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am good at struggling, you know it took 5 people to eventually get me in a locker my freshman year of highschool
[02/06/2008 06:56:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i was like 5"2' back then
[02/06/2008 06:57:01 PM] Leah Shanker: (define functionMaker (lambda (const) (eval (list 'define 'addit (cons lambda (cons '(num) (list '+ const num)
[02/06/2008 06:57:10 PM] Leah Shanker: syntax:
[02/06/2008 06:57:18 PM] Leah Shanker: ((functionMaker 5) 3)

[02/07/2008 03:03:28 PM] Leah Shanker: My heart goes out to him - this was a really hard assignment

[02/08/2008 04:39:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: all operating systems currently do
[02/08/2008 04:40:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think there has been anything innovative done with the operating system since windows moved to ntfs, or since osX came out
[02/08/2008 04:40:41 PM] Leah Shanker: I dunno, looking glass is pretty innovative.
[02/08/2008 04:40:51 PM] Leah Shanker: If I had the hardware, I would run it.

[02/08/2008 04:42:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah - it influenced vista and OSX a lot
[02/08/2008 04:42:16 PM] Leah Shanker: Much like Algol
[02/08/2008 04:42:22 PM] Leah Shanker: not really successful on its own

[02/08/2008 04:44:57 PM] Leah Shanker: I know - it's not really an OS

[02/08/2008 04:45:45 PM] Leah Shanker: It wasn't originally - they bought it from someone else
[02/08/2008 04:46:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: microsoft surface is for resurants?
[02/08/2008 04:46:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate how small companies come up with great ideas, then sell to microsoft
[02/08/2008 04:47:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: microsoft is the last company in the world that i would sell to
[02/08/2008 04:47:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuckin sell outs
[02/08/2008 04:47:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Eh - I would sell out in a minute given the opportunity
[02/08/2008 04:47:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I talked to Martin about this
[02/08/2008 04:48:01 PM] Leah Shanker: big thing at stanford
[02/08/2008 04:48:17 PM] Leah Shanker: is to create little startup companies that implement various cool ideas
[02/08/2008 04:48:26 PM] Leah Shanker: for the entire purpose of selling them for millions.
[02/08/2008 04:48:35 PM] Leah Shanker: And it's actually very successful.
[02/08/2008 04:49:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Businesses aren't really willing to try out new and cool stuff, but they would happily pay someone else should they do the very basic gruntwork
[02/08/2008 04:49:09 PM] Leah Shanker: It's kind of taking advantage of the large corporations
[02/08/2008 04:50:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope i would expand on a good idea, not allow it to become some closed BS project that won't go anywhere in a large company for years
[02/08/2008 04:50:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: windows media player sucks
[02/08/2008 04:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: internet explorer sucks
[02/08/2008 04:51:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: all of those could be handed over to the community and because so much more
[02/08/2008 04:51:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yay communism!
[02/08/2008 04:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: j/k
[02/08/2008 04:51:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah - does sound very marxish :)
[02/08/2008 04:51:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only reason i still use windows media play is because i like the library view the best out of any other player
[02/08/2008 04:51:51 PM] Leah Shanker: You're a liberal, aren't you?
[02/08/2008 04:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: absolutely not
[02/08/2008 04:52:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am very conservative
[02/08/2008 04:52:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just hate companies like microsoft
[02/08/2008 04:52:24 PM] Leah Shanker: Why?
[02/08/2008 04:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am all for capitalism and everyman for himself
[02/08/2008 04:52:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: not just microsoft, they just do so much evil it is hard to not pick on them
[02/08/2008 04:53:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate apple too
[02/08/2008 04:53:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you know this
[02/08/2008 04:53:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but google, and sony, and AMD, and IBM, i love those companies
[02/08/2008 04:54:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: because they put out good stuff, and have decent ethics
[02/08/2008 04:54:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Hm.
[02/08/2008 04:54:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: why are you liberal?
[02/08/2008 04:54:18 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't know if I can agree with you.
[02/08/2008 04:54:21 PM] Leah Shanker: What!
[02/08/2008 04:54:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm not a liberal.
[02/08/2008 04:54:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[02/08/2008 04:54:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: funny thing though
[02/08/2008 04:54:32 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm a libertarian
[02/08/2008 04:54:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: ask dave if he is a liberal
[02/08/2008 04:55:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: for some reason he can't understand that people who has different views as us, sometimes seem like a negative influence on society
[02/08/2008 04:56:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example i don't like liberal views, i think they are a negative influence, some people don't understand that
[02/08/2008 04:56:19 PM] Leah Shanker: wait, what?
[02/08/2008 04:56:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Hm
[02/08/2008 04:56:35 PM] Leah Shanker: That's very closed-minded of you.
[02/08/2008 04:56:46 PM] Leah Shanker: Personally, I am libertarian
[02/08/2008 04:56:47 PM] Leah Shanker: but
[02/08/2008 04:56:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I recognize that people are not mean-hearted.
[02/08/2008 04:57:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Every person has different views because that's what they think is right.
[02/08/2008 04:57:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha, perfect example
[02/08/2008 04:57:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are just like dave in that you don't see other people as a negative influence
[02/08/2008 04:57:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying people are mean
[02/08/2008 04:57:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, because they're not.
[02/08/2008 04:57:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: or even that they do things out of spite
[02/08/2008 04:58:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you ask any of my other conservative friends, they will agree
[02/08/2008 04:58:33 PM] Leah Shanker: So what, your friends agree with you so you're universally correct?
[02/08/2008 04:59:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just saying it is a difference in mentality between liberal, conservative, and libertarian views that's all
[02/08/2008 05:00:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you are one side or the other, then you see the opposing side as exactly that; an opponent.  libertarians are more in the middle and don't understand that conflict
[02/08/2008 05:00:44 PM] Leah Shanker: That's because the conflict itself defeats the purpose of pure democracy.
[02/08/2008 05:00:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not trying to argue, i just thought it was interesting
[02/08/2008 05:01:03 PM] Leah Shanker: If you sit down with a bleeding heart liberal
[02/08/2008 05:01:17 PM] Leah Shanker: There is absolutely no way you can possibly change their mind.
[02/08/2008 05:01:21 PM] Leah Shanker: No matter what you tell them.
[02/08/2008 05:01:26 PM] Leah Shanker: And the same goes for you.
[02/08/2008 05:01:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah?
[02/08/2008 05:01:37 PM] Leah Shanker: If you're adversarial and set in your ways
[02/08/2008 05:01:51 PM] Leah Shanker: you'll never be able to adopt new, cool ideas into your political values
[02/08/2008 05:03:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand, there are constantly new ideas, but depending on our views determines whether or not the ideas are "cool". you may think an idea is cool, but i may think it is horrible.  are you saying you are libertarian because all new ideas are cool?
[02/08/2008 05:04:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not closed minded
[02/08/2008 05:04:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just differently minded
[02/08/2008 05:04:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Thinking that Liberals are a bad influence on society is closed-minded.
[02/08/2008 05:05:01 PM] Leah Shanker: I would make the argument that they have a lot of positive impact.
[02/08/2008 05:05:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Stem Cell Research for one
[02/08/2008 05:05:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are ways to perform stem cell research without using aborted fetuses
[02/08/2008 05:05:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, I know. And the conservatives don't care.
[02/08/2008 05:06:04 PM] Leah Shanker: And we're still not funding it.
[02/08/2008 05:06:35 PM] Leah Shanker: Conservatives can be a "negative" influence on society as well.
[02/08/2008 05:06:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: the conservatives disagree with it because women are paid to abort their child and donate it to research
[02/08/2008 05:06:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i completely agree with that
[02/08/2008 05:07:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am anti-abortion
[02/08/2008 05:07:03 PM] Leah Shanker: That's a very far-fetched idea.
[02/08/2008 05:07:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: not that far fetched
[02/08/2008 05:07:46 PM] Leah Shanker: I've read horror stories about women who could never forgive themselves for aborting their children
[02/08/2008 05:07:54 PM] Leah Shanker: And kill themselves because of it.
[02/08/2008 05:07:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and what you may see as a negative influence i may see as something posative
[02/08/2008 05:08:23 PM] Leah Shanker: That doesn't seem like a complex that would allow women to perform regular abortions just to get money from Stem Cell companies
[02/08/2008 05:09:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Mind you, I agree with you. That scenario would be atrocious.
[02/08/2008 05:09:09 PM] Leah Shanker: But I think the majority of women wouldn't be capable of it.
[02/08/2008 05:09:14 PM] Leah Shanker: vast, vast majority.
[02/08/2008 05:09:34 PM] Leah Shanker: But!
[02/08/2008 05:09:54 PM] Leah Shanker: I agree with you. I disagree with abortion personally and would never bring myself to do it no matter the circumstances.
[02/08/2008 05:10:12 PM] Leah Shanker: But I am not god. And I would not tell another woman that she's not allowed to.
[02/08/2008 05:10:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: my point is, libertarians don't understand that mentality because both parties have good and negative traits, conservatives and liberals don't see things that way
[02/08/2008 05:10:33 PM] Leah Shanker: Nor do I think women who have abortions are a negative influence on society.
[02/08/2008 05:10:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe all conservatives and liberals are close minded who knows
[02/08/2008 05:11:06 PM] Leah Shanker: I would say moderates on either side are not closed minded.
[02/08/2008 05:11:21 PM] Leah Shanker: But extremists (even libertarian extremists)
[02/08/2008 05:11:26 PM] Leah Shanker: are always closed-minded.
[02/08/2008 05:11:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it just seems like there are other things implied when you say extremist
[02/08/2008 05:12:08 PM] Leah Shanker: zealot? That a better word?
[02/08/2008 05:12:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: not really, because i wouldn't really fight to the death for my party
[02/08/2008 05:13:18 PM] Leah Shanker: I would say a lot of conservatives and liberals don't view each other as opponents.
[02/08/2008 05:13:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i probably agree with 90 percent of things that conservatives do, and maybe 10 percent of things that liberals do, i am generalizing a little i can't really think of examples for either
[02/08/2008 05:13:41 PM] Leah Shanker: I can go 50/50 with both.
[02/08/2008 05:14:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and thats why neither side is an opponent
[02/08/2008 05:14:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am not talking directly
[02/08/2008 05:14:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not going to pick someone out on the street and sucker punch them for protesting KFC
[02/08/2008 05:15:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just saying as a whole i don't agree with liberals, so why should i think of them any differently?
[02/08/2008 05:15:50 PM] Leah Shanker: That's the key.
[02/08/2008 05:16:01 PM] Leah Shanker: If you don't agree, that doesn't make the other side wrong.
[02/08/2008 05:16:07 PM] Leah Shanker: No matter how much you want to think so.
[02/08/2008 05:17:12 PM] Leah Shanker: I'd like to think of myself as an open-minded, educated free-thinker who doesn't see anyone else's political views as adversarial.
[02/08/2008 05:17:37 PM] Leah Shanker: But if it helps you to sleep at night to think of liberals as your enemies, then go for it.
[02/08/2008 05:17:44 PM] Leah Shanker: But it's still closed-minded.
[02/08/2008 05:17:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/08/2008 05:18:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: you mistake me, i don't see them as wrong, just different
[02/08/2008 05:18:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: let take something you are passionate about for example
[02/08/2008 05:19:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Open-mindedness?
[02/08/2008 05:19:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: what if i said every immigrant caught crossing the border should be shot on sight?
[02/08/2008 05:19:27 PM] Leah Shanker: I would disagree with you.
[02/08/2008 05:19:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok good
[02/08/2008 05:19:43 PM] Leah Shanker: But I wouldn't say you are wrong.
[02/08/2008 05:20:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: now what if i got together with 1000 people who all agreed with me
[02/08/2008 05:20:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we got the state law changed
[02/08/2008 05:20:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so from now on immigrant were shot
[02/08/2008 05:20:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: bodies were hauled back
[02/08/2008 05:20:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think that would be a negative influence on our state law?
[02/08/2008 05:21:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's a bad change
[02/08/2008 05:21:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: that you don't like
[02/08/2008 05:21:16 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure, I don't like it.
[02/08/2008 05:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan:  = negative influence on state law
[02/08/2008 05:21:29 PM] Leah Shanker: But that doesn't mean you're wrong.
[02/08/2008 05:21:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't think killing people is wrong?
[02/08/2008 05:22:04 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm trying to go with your example.
[02/08/2008 05:22:40 PM] Leah Shanker: And if you want to raise that questions
[02/08/2008 05:22:46 PM] Leah Shanker: I think killing can be justified.
[02/08/2008 05:22:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Very much not the Canadian view.
[02/08/2008 05:22:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah me too, just an example
[02/08/2008 05:23:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree that people can be right or wrong, experiments are done all the time, things can be proven to be right or wrong
[02/08/2008 05:23:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: however
[02/08/2008 05:23:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: peoples opinions, i believe can be wrong
[02/08/2008 05:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i disagree with someone i believe they are wrong
[02/08/2008 05:23:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: if someone said "i don't believe god exists" i would say "you are wrong"
[02/08/2008 05:24:02 PM] Leah Shanker: But they're not wrong.
[02/08/2008 05:24:15 PM] Leah Shanker: If we take out the loaded examples for a second
[02/08/2008 05:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[02/08/2008 05:24:20 PM] Leah Shanker: and really think about the question
[02/08/2008 05:25:05 PM] Leah Shanker: I believe people will always make the best choice in every situation given their values, previous experiences, social constructs and information given to them at the time.
[02/08/2008 05:25:21 PM] Leah Shanker: If you give a person shotty information, they will make the wrong choice.
[02/08/2008 05:25:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Or, the globally wrong choice.
[02/08/2008 05:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd just like to add, i think you are a fascinating person, and i enjoy discussing things with you
[02/08/2008 05:25:45 PM] Leah Shanker: heh thanks
[02/08/2008 05:26:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: here is an example i gave Richard and Travis, and it is very politician of me...
[02/08/2008 05:26:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: this kind of sums up my views
[02/08/2008 05:27:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i absolutely will not respect other people's religions, i think islam is mostly bullshit, BUT i absolutely do respect their right to believe whatever they want to believe
[02/08/2008 05:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would even die for their right
[02/08/2008 05:28:35 PM] Leah Shanker: Interesting thought:
[02/08/2008 05:28:45 PM] Leah Shanker: Jesus is present in Islamic teachings.
[02/08/2008 05:28:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so call me closed minded, but i have put a lot of research and effort into believing what i believe, i am open to new ideas in that i will consider them, but if i disagree, i think the idea is wrong
[02/08/2008 05:29:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah thats right i forgot
[02/08/2008 05:29:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I would even go as far as to say every religion worships the same thing
[02/08/2008 05:29:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: islam was a bad example, i was trying to think back on my world history class
[02/08/2008 05:29:32 PM] Leah Shanker: A higher presence, something greater than ourselves
[02/08/2008 05:29:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Even athiests believe that
[02/08/2008 05:30:05 PM] Leah Shanker: And so, in that vein, every religion is essentially the same.
[02/08/2008 05:30:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would mostly agree
[02/08/2008 05:30:44 PM] Leah Shanker: So how can you think someone is wrong if they are on your team?
[02/08/2008 05:30:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: until i see people being slaughtered because they believe in something different
[02/08/2008 05:31:06 PM] Leah Shanker: But that's people, right?
[02/08/2008 05:31:10 PM] Leah Shanker: People kill other people.
[02/08/2008 05:31:14 PM] Leah Shanker: Religions don't kill people.
[02/08/2008 05:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: when a US soldier gets his throat cut out  for being an "infidel", that is when i know people do not worship the same god
[02/08/2008 05:31:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: people kill other people under the instruction of their religion
[02/08/2008 05:31:56 PM] Leah Shanker: Of their leaders.
[02/08/2008 05:31:59 PM] Leah Shanker: Not their religion.
[02/08/2008 05:32:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so no, religions do kill people
[02/08/2008 05:32:22 PM] Leah Shanker: The Bible and the Koran have many violent texts
[02/08/2008 05:32:30 PM] Leah Shanker: People can mutate holy words into anything they want.
[02/08/2008 05:32:37 PM] Leah Shanker: For their own purposes
[02/08/2008 05:32:58 PM] Leah Shanker: I would go as far as to say it's inevitable.
[02/08/2008 05:33:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: true, but that goes back to me definitively being right, and the holy wars were justified
[02/08/2008 05:33:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that's also true
[02/08/2008 05:33:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: words are manipulated
[02/08/2008 05:33:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit this DVD won't copy
[02/08/2008 05:35:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i am just more aggressive 
[02/08/2008 05:35:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: *too
[02/08/2008 05:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am not the only one
[02/08/2008 05:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know a lot of people that like me
[02/08/2008 05:36:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: just none of them are good looking women (sad) :-(
[02/08/2008 05:37:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: mMm beer
[02/08/2008 05:37:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: you and Matt have dinner plans?
[02/08/2008 05:37:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think Dave and I are going to grill something
[02/08/2008 05:42:35 PM] Leah Shanker: Cool
[02/08/2008 05:43:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Tonight is our date night, we're going out to dinner. But we're both down for something afterwards
[02/08/2008 05:43:14 PM] Leah Shanker: if you guys wanna play some games/watch a movie or just hang out
[02/08/2008 05:43:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely, you know i have a collection
[02/08/2008 05:44:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: we've got the wii and playstation 3 hooked up to the projector
[02/08/2008 05:44:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's pretty sweet
[02/08/2008 05:44:06 PM] Leah Shanker: woohoo
[02/08/2008 05:44:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's my date night with dave
[02/08/2008 05:44:29 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[02/08/2008 05:44:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: shoot i forgot to get patricks screen name
[02/08/2008 05:45:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I'll give you a call around 8 or 9ish if you wanna hang out
[02/08/2008 05:45:24 PM] Leah Shanker: what kind of alcoholic goodness do you like?
[02/08/2008 05:45:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool, sounds good
[02/08/2008 05:45:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have plenty of grey goose and beer
[02/08/2008 05:46:08 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, we will add a little girliness to your repertoire.
[02/08/2008 05:46:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have probably 2 liters worth of grey goose in the freezer
[02/08/2008 05:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to do that
[02/08/2008 05:46:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Perhaps should you have ladyfriends over later

[02/08/2008 05:47:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh, not many girlie friends i would invite over
[02/08/2008 05:47:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know a few, but most girls annoy me
[02/08/2008 05:47:26 PM] Leah Shanker: You haven't met my girlfriends.
[02/08/2008 05:47:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: are they annoying?
[02/08/2008 05:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should bring girls, instead of  girlie drinks
[02/08/2008 05:47:48 PM] Leah Shanker: haha, no way. I hate girls for the most part too.
[02/08/2008 05:48:02 PM] Leah Shanker: lol - They're mostly engineers. Which means they're probably busy.
[02/08/2008 05:48:09 PM] Leah Shanker: But I will see what I can do
[02/08/2008 05:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol k
[02/08/2008 05:48:39 PM] Leah Shanker: But for this time, I will have to girlie up your shindig
[02/08/2008 05:48:48 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway! you keep me, I must go!

[02/09/2008 11:58:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit they changed to a map i don't like
[02/09/2008 11:58:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure you don't want to play?
[02/09/2008 11:58:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: not all quake 3 mods are like wuake 3
[02/09/2008 11:58:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: *quake
[02/10/2008 12:00:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am using a noob gun
[02/10/2008 12:03:52 AM] Leah Shanker: Yup, was fun.
[02/10/2008 12:03:56 AM] Leah Shanker: Nope, don't like Quake 3
[02/10/2008 12:04:09 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm not a fan of the FPS style gameplat
[02/10/2008 12:04:14 AM] Leah Shanker: gameplay*
[02/10/2008 12:04:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmmm
[02/10/2008 12:04:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: based on what?
[02/10/2008 12:04:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: camera angles?
[02/10/2008 12:04:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: tabular rasa is pretty close
[02/10/2008 12:05:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are a lot of RPS FPS
[02/10/2008 12:05:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: bioshock, blacksite:area 51
[02/10/2008 12:06:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love FPS
[02/10/2008 12:06:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i got tired of being 10 points ahead of everyone
[02/10/2008 12:06:39 AM] Leah Shanker: TabRas is Third-Person-Shotoer
[02/10/2008 12:06:41 AM] Leah Shanker: shooter*
[02/10/2008 12:06:51 AM] Leah Shanker: I really like 3ps.
[02/10/2008 12:06:57 AM] Leah Shanker: That's probably my favorite gamestyle.
[02/10/2008 12:07:00 AM] Leah Shanker: FPS kinda makes me sick
[02/10/2008 12:07:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: man i wouldn't have it any other way
[02/10/2008 12:07:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love FPS
[02/10/2008 12:07:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love respawn
[02/10/2008 12:08:06 AM] Leah Shanker: I can see how people would like it
[02/10/2008 12:08:10 AM] Leah Shanker: but to me, it's really limiting.
[02/10/2008 12:08:16 AM] Leah Shanker: Most FPSes are all about your click-skill.
[02/10/2008 12:08:24 AM] Leah Shanker: how fast you can click, how accurate
[02/10/2008 12:08:29 AM] Leah Shanker: not really about an enriching story
[02/10/2008 12:08:51 AM] Leah Shanker: Generally speaking, anyway
[02/10/2008 12:08:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: untrue
[02/10/2008 12:08:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i will explain in a minute
[02/10/2008 12:11:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: so
[02/10/2008 12:11:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i believe FPS is a perspective, not a paradigm
[02/10/2008 12:11:55 AM] Leah Shanker: Yes, technically it is.
[02/10/2008 12:11:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are tons of FPS games with a story, and developing character
[02/10/2008 12:12:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: HL2 for example
[02/10/2008 12:12:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: amazing story
[02/10/2008 12:12:16 AM] Leah Shanker: Like Vampire: Bloodlines
[02/10/2008 12:12:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: would make and excellent sci fi
[02/10/2008 12:12:23 AM] Leah Shanker: also based on the halflife engine
[02/10/2008 12:12:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/10/2008 12:13:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: so do you just not enjoy the perspective of most FPS games?
[02/10/2008 12:13:30 AM] Leah Shanker: I don't enjoy the gun-based FPS games
[02/10/2008 12:13:43 AM] Leah Shanker: where you're peeking around corners and quickly shooting someone
[02/10/2008 12:13:48 AM] Leah Shanker: doesn't light my fire really.
[02/10/2008 12:14:14 AM] Leah Shanker: The perspective doesn't bother me, it's more the feel of the game.
[02/10/2008 12:15:54 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, I think I've defined it
[02/10/2008 12:16:07 AM] Leah Shanker: I enjoy the abstraction layer above the shooting mechanism
[02/10/2008 12:16:29 AM] Leah Shanker: So like, in Vampire Bloodlines, you would approach an enemy and attack from a certain angle, dodge, move, etc.
[02/10/2008 12:16:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok i entirely agree with you
[02/10/2008 12:16:46 AM] Leah Shanker: It wasn't about aiming my cursor
[02/10/2008 12:17:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i would love to take your FPS verginity away
[02/10/2008 12:17:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: *virginity
[02/10/2008 12:17:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i promise you there is a lot more to FPS then dodging bullets
[02/10/2008 12:19:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel you have a skewed perspective based on only a few FPS
[02/10/2008 12:19:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: and although i am playing on the Q3 engine, does not mean i am playing Q3
[02/10/2008 12:19:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would just like to add, counterstrike sucks
[02/10/2008 12:20:35 AM] Leah Shanker: unreal is another one
[02/10/2008 12:20:44 AM] Leah Shanker: unreal tournament, marathon
[02/10/2008 12:21:15 AM] Leah Shanker: So if you can show me an FPS style game that isn't a aim-click fest
[02/10/2008 12:21:27 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm open
[02/10/2008 12:22:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i believe i can, but it will take some participation from you, because i am no quite sure what amount of strategy you are used to
[02/10/2008 12:22:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: *or enjoy
[02/10/2008 12:22:59 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, I like Thief-type games. Bloodlines was pretty close to that.
[02/10/2008 12:23:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i completely agree with you that most FPS is an "aim click fest"
[02/10/2008 12:23:28 AM] Leah Shanker: Which I highly recommend, btw.
[02/10/2008 12:23:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines
[02/10/2008 12:23:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: have you played any hitman? or other tomclancy games?
[02/10/2008 12:23:51 AM] Leah Shanker: nope
[02/10/2008 12:24:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: omg
[02/10/2008 12:24:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: amazing
[02/10/2008 12:25:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will bring it with me to campus, so whenever you are free, or maybe just reading slashdot we can play it
[02/10/2008 12:26:33 AM] Leah Shanker: sure
[02/10/2008 12:29:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: fuck i hate pistols only
[02/10/2008 12:31:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i enjoy every type of game
[02/10/2008 12:33:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are only specific games that i don't like
[02/10/2008 12:33:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: like counterstrike
[02/10/2008 12:33:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's like java
[02/10/2008 12:34:23 AM] Leah Shanker: heh. how's that?
[02/10/2008 12:34:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: it sucks
[02/10/2008 12:35:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: not descriptive enough
[02/10/2008 12:35:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok, it is too bulky for the little that it does
[02/10/2008 12:37:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: java violates a principle, can't remember the name but it is the "cost of using a feature"
[02/10/2008 12:39:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: counterstrike sucks the same way, there is amazing physics since they ported it to the source engine, but the graphics don't match and it is "slow"
[02/10/2008 12:39:33 AM] Leah Shanker: graphics sucking and being slow
[02/10/2008 12:39:38 AM] Leah Shanker: also Java-like
[02/10/2008 12:40:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: ha, yeah
[02/10/2008 01:15:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love this game

[02/10/2008 04:48:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: friday night
[02/10/2008 04:49:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Ah yes, too busy having wild unbridled sex.
[02/10/2008 04:50:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow
[02/10/2008 04:50:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was honest
[02/10/2008 04:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope it was entirely enjoyable
[02/10/2008 04:50:22 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[02/10/2008 04:50:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry, I meant my date was fun.
[02/10/2008 04:51:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh no, i don't mind, i look forward to that benefit of marriage someday
[02/10/2008 04:51:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad you had a good time
[02/10/2008 04:51:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: date night is a good idea
[02/10/2008 04:51:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: good way to keep things alive
[02/10/2008 04:52:11 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, we both tend to be really busy/independent people
[02/10/2008 04:52:21 PM] Leah Shanker: and unless we boringly "schedule" a date night, it will never happen.
[02/10/2008 04:52:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/10/2008 04:52:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i think most people in our major are independent
[02/10/2008 04:52:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is the logical way to be
[02/10/2008 04:53:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: like a volcon
[02/10/2008 04:53:10 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[02/10/2008 04:53:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i was more like spock
[02/10/2008 04:54:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I wish I was more like data
[02/10/2008 04:54:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/10/2008 04:55:17 PM] Leah Shanker: what are you doing tonight?
[02/10/2008 04:55:25 PM] Leah Shanker: we're thinking of getting together and watching American Beauty
[02/10/2008 04:55:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: excellent movie, i would totally be down
[02/10/2008 04:55:48 PM] Leah Shanker: we've all seen it, but we had a discussion on suburban living and dysfunctional relationships
[02/10/2008 04:56:00 PM] Leah Shanker: and that movie came up again
[02/10/2008 04:56:19 PM] Leah Shanker: cool, we're planning on doing a little dinner party shindig beforehand at abes
[02/10/2008 04:56:24 PM] Leah Shanker: probably around 7 or 8ish
[02/10/2008 04:56:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: travis and i though of a discussion topic
[02/10/2008 04:56:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't remember now
[02/10/2008 04:57:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it was probably about singularity
[02/10/2008 04:58:02 PM] Leah Shanker: sorry, vpn again
[02/10/2008 04:58:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Have you read that book
[02/10/2008 04:58:10 PM] Leah Shanker: "The Singularity is Near"
[02/10/2008 04:58:11 PM] Leah Shanker: ?
[02/10/2008 04:58:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[02/10/2008 04:58:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it good?
[02/10/2008 04:58:30 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, Matt's got a copy, I'll lend it to you tonight
[02/10/2008 04:58:38 PM] Leah Shanker: it's mind-blowing to think about
[02/10/2008 04:58:56 PM] Leah Shanker: how we may have nanite technology that will allow another layer of abstraction soon
[02/10/2008 04:58:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i love the idea, but i don't know much about it
[02/10/2008 04:59:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[02/10/2008 04:59:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Like, there is a layer above human.
[02/10/2008 04:59:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Just in the way that all our cells are self-sufficient and help a larger organism survive
[02/10/2008 04:59:53 PM] Leah Shanker: humans are going to become part of this giant, massive "cultural organism"
[02/10/2008 05:00:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[02/10/2008 05:00:25 PM] Leah Shanker: It's very humbling.
[02/10/2008 05:00:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/10/2008 05:00:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i invite travis to come tonight?
[02/10/2008 05:00:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure
[02/10/2008 05:01:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i actually have a lot of food i need to eat here or it will go bad
[02/10/2008 05:01:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i might come a little late, don't wait up for me
[02/10/2008 05:01:47 PM] Leah Shanker: ok - or you can bring it
[02/10/2008 05:02:00 PM] Leah Shanker: It's going to be sort of a potluck thing, etc.
[02/10/2008 05:03:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would, but i don't think there would be enough for other people
[02/10/2008 05:03:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: just some lunch meat and left over vegitables
[02/10/2008 05:03:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i supposed i could bring salad stuff
[02/10/2008 05:03:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: *suppose
[02/10/2008 05:04:39 PM] Leah Shanker: meh, you don't have to. usually there's way more than enough food
[02/10/2008 05:04:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know what i really love?
[02/10/2008 05:05:08 PM] Leah Shanker: corn nuts?
[02/10/2008 05:05:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Jut a guess
[02/10/2008 05:05:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: tostitoes with cheese salsa
[02/10/2008 05:05:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: corn nuts are ok
[02/10/2008 05:05:28 PM] Leah Shanker: nom nom
[02/10/2008 05:06:07 PM] Leah Shanker: I love cheese.
[02/10/2008 05:06:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/10/2008 05:06:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Seriously, I've written down my retirement dream to be
[02/10/2008 05:06:28 PM] Leah Shanker: "retire to a cheese farm"
[02/10/2008 05:06:38 PM] Leah Shanker: where I spend all my livelong days makin' cheese
[02/10/2008 05:09:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: blue team is getting rocked
[02/10/2008 05:12:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am rocking them with the PSG1
[02/10/2008 05:16:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's an 8 shot high velocity riffle with a scope

[02/13/2008 01:34:23 PM] Leah Shanker: j/k I suppose it's a more creative choice than "cool"
[02/13/2008 01:35:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: that such a simple concept of a cat being traped in the ceiling could be turning into something so amusing

[02/13/2008 04:16:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: just for future reference
[02/13/2008 04:17:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Then perhaps you should reconsider how mean you are to travis
[02/13/2008 04:17:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you mistake people a lot
[02/13/2008 04:18:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it is just a difference in how you were raised
[02/13/2008 04:18:20 PM] Leah Shanker: I was raised to be nice to people :)
[02/13/2008 04:18:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i grew up in many different environments where it was common to tease people
[02/13/2008 04:18:31 PM] Leah Shanker: except when they cross me
[02/13/2008 04:18:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: friends
[02/13/2008 04:18:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: teasing is a sign of love to me
[02/13/2008 04:18:46 PM] Leah Shanker: But he doesn't tease you
[02/13/2008 04:18:53 PM] Leah Shanker: and you don't tease anyone else, just him.
[02/13/2008 04:19:01 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't see you teasing richard
[02/13/2008 04:19:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you know someone well enough to poke a little fun at them, then you must love that person
[02/13/2008 04:19:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: he actually does tease me quite often
[02/13/2008 04:19:47 PM] Leah Shanker: I agree with you, I teased and am teased by my friends a lot too
[02/13/2008 04:19:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i do tease richard on occasion, especially when he acts out sound effects of inanimate objects
[02/13/2008 04:19:59 PM] Leah Shanker: but not in a mean way
[02/13/2008 04:20:12 PM] Leah Shanker: "Is that bag too heavy for you, Travis?"
[02/13/2008 04:20:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you may not notice when travis teases me, but i know him very well, and i know when he is making fun of me, he does it very discretely
[02/13/2008 04:21:03 PM] Leah Shanker: And goading him into drinking!
[02/13/2008 04:21:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Why don't you do that to Richard?
[02/13/2008 04:21:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was really just my way of asking if he wanted me to carry it instead
[02/13/2008 04:21:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he knew that
[02/13/2008 04:21:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you obviously didn't
[02/13/2008 04:21:43 PM] Leah Shanker: I get it - boys are boys and they tend to tease each other.
[02/13/2008 04:21:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: richard has made it clear he won't drink until 21, i have had many conversations with him about it
[02/13/2008 04:22:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tease travis about drinking because he insists on drinking but he doesn't enjoy the taste
[02/13/2008 04:22:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so there are different scenarios for all the things you overhear or witness
[02/13/2008 04:23:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Travis engages my mommy mode.
[02/13/2008 04:23:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but my point is, i've known richard for over 3 and 1/2 years, and i've know travis for at least 2
[02/13/2008 04:23:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah he does that
[02/13/2008 04:23:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it's because he's so innocent, and in a few ways naive 
[02/13/2008 04:24:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i love my friends very much, and at least half of the time i spend teasing them, i make up for it by showing them that i care
[02/13/2008 04:24:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so think what you want about the negative intentions of my heart
[02/13/2008 04:25:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry i brought this on you at such and arbitrary and unexpected time
[02/13/2008 04:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: just something i was thinking about today
[02/13/2008 04:25:58 PM] Leah Shanker: I understand: It's like the Dane Cook Girl Bomb :)
[02/13/2008 04:26:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Little one-liners that get you later.
[02/13/2008 04:26:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha, i am not attacking you for saying that, it is just apart of your personality
[02/13/2008 04:26:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was teased in class today i guess that's why i was thinking about it
[02/13/2008 04:27:01 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[02/13/2008 04:27:08 PM] Leah Shanker: But you're not innocent.
[02/13/2008 04:27:15 PM] Leah Shanker: It doesn't pain me to watch you get teased :)
[02/13/2008 04:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: nor naive
[02/13/2008 04:27:37 PM] Leah Shanker: When Travis gets teased, I go all amazonian.
[02/13/2008 04:27:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i try to project innocence, but people who know me know that i am a cynic
[02/13/2008 04:27:55 PM] Leah Shanker: You fail miserably :)
[02/13/2008 04:28:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[02/13/2008 04:28:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Welcome :)
[02/13/2008 04:28:16 PM] Leah Shanker: It's not a bad thing, just a characteristic
[02/13/2008 04:28:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is because i know i can be honest with my friends
[02/13/2008 04:28:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, and to comment on what you said last night, zodiac signs
[02/13/2008 04:29:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: behind my dark sense of humor and cynicism, i am actually very accommodating to a significant other, i think you would be surprised
[02/13/2008 04:29:45 PM] Leah Shanker: You talking about English girl?
[02/13/2008 04:30:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Since we're going zodiac

[02/13/2008 04:30:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: well in general
[02/13/2008 04:30:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i haven't met her
[02/13/2008 04:30:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope i have the opportunity though

[02/13/2008 04:30:49 PM] Leah Shanker: Since we're going zodiac anyway
[02/13/2008 04:30:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you think you have me all figured out, but i tend to conceal my sensitive side, and i think you would agree that is one thing i do quite well
[02/13/2008 04:31:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Haha, very true of the scorpio.
[02/13/2008 04:31:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[02/13/2008 04:31:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do fit a lot of scorpio triats
[02/13/2008 04:31:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: my step dad is a scorpio too, and out of his 2 other sons i am the one most like him and we aren't even blood related
[02/13/2008 04:32:19 PM] Leah Shanker: They say two scorpios don't tend to get along
[02/13/2008 04:32:55 PM] Leah Shanker: In general
[02/13/2008 04:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't say we got along, i just said i was a lot like him
[02/13/2008 04:33:17 PM] Leah Shanker: I used to really think all this zodiac crap was total bullshit
[02/13/2008 04:33:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think i've ever had more then a 5 minute conversation with him
[02/13/2008 04:33:31 PM] Leah Shanker: really? how long have you known him?
[02/13/2008 04:34:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: 18 years
[02/13/2008 04:34:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i was about 2 and 1/2 when he and my mother got married
[02/13/2008 04:34:49 PM] Leah Shanker: wow
[02/13/2008 04:35:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i may exaggerate, but our longest conversations are in the car, and i really have no choice in that situation

[02/13/2008 04:35:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Do you consider him your dad now?
[02/13/2008 04:35:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean, if he's been there since you were two...
[02/13/2008 04:39:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, you don't have to answer that
[02/13/2008 04:39:32 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm just curious, I've never had any experience with step-parents.
[02/13/2008 04:41:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i consider him my dad
[02/13/2008 04:41:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have 2 dads

[02/16/2008 05:05:10 PM] Leah Shanker: do you still take ADD medication?
[02/16/2008 05:16:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[02/16/2008 05:23:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Just wondering, I'm considering going to see someone about it.
[02/16/2008 05:23:20 PM] Leah Shanker: I've read about little things you can change, like diet, to combat the effects of ADD
[02/16/2008 05:23:42 PM] Leah Shanker: but also on forums, people are saying that there is nothing that remotely comes close to just taking the medication.
[02/16/2008 05:29:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: does matt take it?
[02/16/2008 05:29:41 PM] Leah Shanker: He did when he was younger
[02/16/2008 05:29:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah same
[02/16/2008 05:29:50 PM] Leah Shanker: He's outgrown his ADD by this point
[02/16/2008 05:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i stopped half way through high school

[02/25/2008 10:47:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: sony doesn't do that anymore!
[02/25/2008 10:47:44 AM] Leah Shanker: You can buy DRM free songs now, you know.
[02/25/2008 10:47:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: they learned their lesson!
[02/25/2008 10:47:50 AM] Leah Shanker: What?
[02/25/2008 10:47:54 AM] Leah Shanker: You are kidding, right?
[02/25/2008 10:48:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: sony doesn't put rootkits on computers anymore
[02/25/2008 10:48:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: they still use a lot of drm
[02/25/2008 10:48:21 AM] Leah Shanker: Sony has been notorious for invasive DRM before
[02/25/2008 10:48:33 AM] Leah Shanker: with EQ also
[02/25/2008 10:48:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: and by before you mean once with the rootkit that went to court and they were forced to remove it
[02/25/2008 10:49:21 AM] Leah Shanker: What kind of company can justify using a rootkit in the first place?
[02/25/2008 10:49:34 AM] Leah Shanker: Regardless of whether they were forced to remove it or not.
[02/25/2008 10:49:56 AM] Leah Shanker: I've been a longtime fan of Sony products because they're long-lasting
[02/25/2008 10:49:58 AM] Leah Shanker: but
[02/25/2008 10:50:11 AM] Leah Shanker: Their recent DRM scandals makes me very wary of ever using their products again
[02/25/2008 10:50:28 AM] Leah Shanker: How can I trust a company that puts my computer at risk?
[02/25/2008 10:50:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: you act like sony just does what ever they want
[02/25/2008 10:51:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: they have contracts with companies that force them to legally abide by other companies drm rules
[02/25/2008 10:51:20 AM] Leah Shanker: So does Apple
[02/25/2008 10:51:28 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm not complaining about the DRM.
[02/25/2008 10:51:39 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm complaining about the shady company practices.
[02/25/2008 10:51:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: they admitted it wasn't right and fixed the problem, but it wasn't just some head of sony that was like "hey lets fuck with people here"
[02/25/2008 10:52:27 AM] Leah Shanker: No, the problem in the first place was they needed root access on machines to make their DRM guard effective
[02/25/2008 10:52:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are right apple has restrictive contracts too
[02/25/2008 10:52:55 AM] Leah Shanker: So they exploited a known vulnerability and rootkitted your computer.
[02/25/2008 10:52:58 AM] Leah Shanker: They hacked you.
[02/25/2008 10:53:02 AM] Leah Shanker: It really is as bad as that.
[02/25/2008 10:53:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: but my point is, sony is still that reliable company we all know and love
[02/25/2008 10:53:27 AM] Leah Shanker: And I disagree.
[02/25/2008 10:53:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes and then they apologized 
[02/25/2008 10:53:44 AM] Leah Shanker: ahaha
[02/25/2008 10:53:47 AM] Leah Shanker: That makes it ok, does it?
[02/25/2008 10:53:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: they didn't do any damage to me
[02/25/2008 10:54:09 AM] Leah Shanker: They broke my trust.
[02/25/2008 10:54:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think rootkits are an interesting idea, frankly i was impressed
[02/25/2008 10:54:44 AM] Leah Shanker: Hm, you obviously don't know much about rootkits.
[02/25/2008 10:55:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: they may have implemented it with more security holes than it protected
[02/25/2008 10:55:30 AM] Leah Shanker: Rootkits do not protect you.
[02/25/2008 10:55:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[02/25/2008 10:55:41 AM] Leah Shanker: Rootkits have no other purpose but to own you.
[02/25/2008 10:55:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was meant to protect their software
[02/25/2008 10:56:15 AM] Leah Shanker: But it was an outright security attack
[02/25/2008 10:56:43 AM] Leah Shanker: Sony openly released malware into the public
[02/25/2008 10:56:55 AM] Leah Shanker: Put their Sony stamp of approval on a rootkit.
[02/25/2008 10:57:05 AM] Leah Shanker: That makes me not trust anything Sony says anymore.
[02/25/2008 10:57:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/25/2008 10:58:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: you make it should like a pretty nasty break up
[02/25/2008 10:58:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: how were you affected by it?
[02/25/2008 10:58:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you get a virus?
[02/25/2008 10:58:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: did they crash your computer?
[02/25/2008 10:58:27 AM] Leah Shanker: Nope, but that's not the point.
[02/25/2008 10:58:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's the principle?
[02/25/2008 10:58:50 AM] Leah Shanker: If you have sex with someone when you knowingly have AIDS and not tell them
[02/25/2008 10:58:56 AM] Leah Shanker: it doesn't matter that they don't get AIDS.
[02/25/2008 10:59:22 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, that was a hugely loaded example.
[02/25/2008 10:59:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/25/2008 10:59:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: but funny
[02/25/2008 10:59:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[02/25/2008 10:59:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i understand
[02/25/2008 10:59:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's the principle of it
[02/25/2008 10:59:48 AM] Leah Shanker: Yes
[02/25/2008 11:00:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: well it is good that you are such a dedicated mac user

[02/25/2008 11:04:35 AM] Leah Shanker: Buy it off iTunes Plus :)
[02/25/2008 11:04:50 AM] Leah Shanker: DRM free
[02/25/2008 11:05:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: iTunes plus?
[02/25/2008 11:05:41 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, for $1.25 you can buy songs DRM free on itunes.
[02/25/2008 11:05:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: so its more expensive?

[02/25/2008 11:11:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: i agree with that entirely
[02/25/2008 11:12:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: unfortunately the record industry conglomerate gets most of the money
[02/25/2008 11:12:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the artists only get a tiny percentage
[02/25/2008 11:13:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if music artists go on strike, and i can't listen to metallica or red hot chilli pepper's new stuff, then i will start sending the artists money in the mail
[02/25/2008 11:13:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: or over paypal
[02/25/2008 11:13:42 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, playing devil's advocate here
[02/25/2008 11:13:53 AM] Leah Shanker: The record companies do actually do a lot of work.
[02/25/2008 11:14:12 AM] Leah Shanker: They probably do the hardest work - they're the reason we've even heard songs that we love.
[02/25/2008 11:14:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: interesting concept, what if music sales companies like itunes or rhapsody had like and iso standard contract between individual artists
[02/25/2008 11:15:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is true, but the price of advertising is not equal to the price of your soul
[02/25/2008 11:15:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[02/25/2008 11:15:09 AM] Leah Shanker: heh
[02/25/2008 11:15:28 AM] Leah Shanker: Advertisement is hard work - from the one class I took and one book that I've read
[02/25/2008 11:15:43 AM] Leah Shanker: I would call it a manipulative art form.
[02/25/2008 11:16:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would definitely agree, but i doubt its the advertising artists that get the money either
[02/25/2008 11:16:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Yup, it takes money to make money. The big financial backers make the most.
[02/25/2008 11:16:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think my sister is going into advertising graphic design, she makes me so proud :-D
[02/25/2008 11:17:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: it has always fascinated me

[03/01/2008 06:13:52 PM] Leah Shanker: eh, don't worry about it. i'm just glad he's ok
[03/01/2008 06:14:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i has stuff to tell you
[03/01/2008 06:14:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i has present for you

[03/01/2008 06:16:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho, the only reason i am telling you this is because i think it is in the people's best interest
[03/01/2008 06:16:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: first i know how you mentions joe complaining and being really annoying
[03/01/2008 06:17:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he told me last night that he was disappointed because he was really looking forward to going to his first party
[03/01/2008 06:18:34 PM] Leah Shanker: uh huh
[03/01/2008 06:18:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i just thought you should know
[03/01/2008 06:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: that i have come to the realization that if joe complains about something, it is good for him to do it anyways so he can learn to fuckin deal with it
[03/01/2008 06:19:18 PM] Leah Shanker: he's been to parties before.
[03/01/2008 06:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: does he drink?
[03/01/2008 06:19:39 PM] Leah Shanker: no, he's allergic.
[03/01/2008 06:19:43 PM] Leah Shanker: or thinks he is
[03/01/2008 06:19:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: to beer

[03/01/2008 06:25:32 PM] Leah Shanker: wait, why would dave think that?
[03/01/2008 06:26:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is kind of insecure, that is why he didn't really hang out before now
[03/01/2008 06:26:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: he felt bad for misbehaving, but i don't think he will admit it to you guys
[03/01/2008 06:29:55 PM] Leah Shanker: i don't think he needs to apologize
[03/01/2008 06:29:59 PM] Leah Shanker: he didn't really do anything
[03/01/2008 06:30:40 PM] Leah Shanker: He was having a good time
[03/01/2008 06:30:51 PM] Leah Shanker: I've been crazy drunk like that before
[03/01/2008 06:30:56 PM] Leah Shanker: way worse than that.
[03/01/2008 06:31:14 PM] Leah Shanker: I wouldn't say he was misbehaving in the least
[03/01/2008 06:32:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but he had some of us worried
[03/01/2008 06:32:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: about security coming, about him disappearing
[03/01/2008 06:32:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was the big thing
[03/01/2008 06:34:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying he should be ashamed
[03/01/2008 06:34:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have all been there
[03/01/2008 06:35:45 PM] Leah Shanker: if security had come, he would have only gotten himself into trouble.
[03/01/2008 06:36:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[03/01/2008 06:36:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways i just don't want to discourage you from partying with us someday when it eventually happens maybe

[03/05/2008 06:34:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: are the new battle star galactica based on the 2003 miniseries or should i get the 1980 one too?
[03/05/2008 06:35:21 PM] Leah Shanker: no, dont get the 1980s one.
[03/05/2008 06:35:26 PM] Leah Shanker: just the miniseries
[03/05/2008 06:35:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so by your logic the sun would keep you warm in space
[03/05/2008 06:35:47 PM] Leah Shanker: If you were close enought o the sun, yes.
[03/05/2008 06:36:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you don't explode because then human body has enough strength to hold you together
[03/05/2008 06:36:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we were designed  that way
[03/05/2008 06:36:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you actually die from suffocation but it still takes about 20 seconds to make you pass out
[03/05/2008 06:37:02 PM] Leah Shanker: right - you dont explode without outside force
[03/05/2008 06:37:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, you die from suffication.
[03/05/2008 06:37:20 PM] Leah Shanker: But you also freeze.
[03/05/2008 06:37:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes the body can still hold itself together in less then 1 ppi
[03/05/2008 06:38:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: eventually you freeze
[03/05/2008 06:38:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but not like in the movies
[03/05/2008 06:38:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: because heat doesn't transfer away from your body quick enough
[03/05/2008 06:38:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Agreed
[03/05/2008 06:39:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that could take minutes at least
[03/05/2008 06:39:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe hours to totally freeze
[03/05/2008 06:39:36 PM] Leah Shanker: yup - you dont become a block of ice in space
[03/05/2008 06:39:40 PM] Leah Shanker: but you still freeze
[03/05/2008 06:39:47 PM] Leah Shanker: immediately, anyway
[03/05/2008 06:39:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could freeze on earth though
[03/05/2008 06:39:57 PM] Leah Shanker: true
[03/05/2008 06:40:08 PM] Leah Shanker: And it's just a little bit faster in space
[03/05/2008 06:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so in the movies they always show people  freezing and shattering
[03/05/2008 06:40:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is ridiculous
[03/05/2008 06:40:43 PM] Leah Shanker: heh, yeah
[03/05/2008 06:40:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: in my drunken rage i meant you don't die like in the movies in space
[03/05/2008 06:40:54 PM] Leah Shanker: BSG had a pretty good space scene.
[03/05/2008 06:40:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you are right
[03/05/2008 06:41:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am downloading all of them right now
[03/05/2008 06:41:30 PM] Leah Shanker: watch the miniseries first!
[03/05/2008 06:41:34 PM] Leah Shanker: or you'll be totally lost
[03/05/2008 06:42:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have seen it a lot but i plan to watch it again
[03/05/2008 06:43:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i saw it in 2003 when it came out, and i saw all of it like senior year of high school
[03/05/2008 06:43:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so about last night
[03/05/2008 06:43:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to shave and be on tv to be a hot CS guy?
[03/05/2008 06:43:18 PM] Leah Shanker: haha
[03/05/2008 06:43:44 PM] Leah Shanker: growing a beard is so freshman.
[03/05/2008 06:43:58 PM] Leah Shanker: it's the I-can-grow-a-beard-so-I-do mentality
[03/05/2008 06:44:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: generally people can't tell that i am in computer science unless we get into a deep conversation
[03/05/2008 06:44:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I agree, you're not typical.
[03/05/2008 06:44:27 PM] Leah Shanker: I have the same problem :)
[03/05/2008 06:44:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: unlike travis i don't ask people what kind of computer they have the first time i meet them
[03/05/2008 06:44:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is a good think
[03/05/2008 06:44:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: it makes you more personable
[03/05/2008 06:45:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone other outside our clique can relate to
[03/05/2008 06:45:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: more easily
[03/05/2008 06:45:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I've always tried to be open-minded to new people
[03/05/2008 06:45:43 PM] Leah Shanker: I have this deep value that I think I can learn something from everyone I meet.
[03/05/2008 06:45:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you ever hung out with band people before?
[03/05/2008 06:45:55 PM] Leah Shanker: My first boyfriend was in band
[03/05/2008 06:46:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: well they always end up talking about band
[03/05/2008 06:46:17 PM] Leah Shanker: heh, that's not my experience.
[03/05/2008 06:46:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when there are non-band people trying to be included in conversation, it makes the kind of uncomfortable
[03/05/2008 06:46:34 PM] Leah Shanker: But I can see your point
[03/05/2008 06:47:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: like in CS, i try to talk about stuff on everyone's level, not the indepth stuff when we are only amongst CS people
[03/05/2008 06:47:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: unfortunately being personable still hasn't helped me find another girlfriend
[03/05/2008 06:47:38 PM] Leah Shanker: It doesn't hurt.
[03/05/2008 06:47:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: but Dave also came up when we were talking about the self improvement stuff
[03/05/2008 06:47:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he has nothing on me
[03/05/2008 06:48:15 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, I think you are more approachable than Dave.
[03/05/2008 06:48:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, but he is tall and dark
[03/05/2008 06:48:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: women like that
[03/05/2008 06:48:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah they do.
[03/05/2008 06:48:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have had a meaningful relationship within the last ten years
[03/05/2008 06:49:12 PM] Leah Shanker: If you'd like my humble opinion
[03/05/2008 06:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want something more solid, not just a physical relationship
[03/05/2008 06:49:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what i am trying to derive
[03/05/2008 06:49:39 PM] Leah Shanker: dave's problem is that he doesn't love himself.
[03/05/2008 06:49:44 PM] Leah Shanker: and, here's the cliche.
[03/05/2008 06:49:47 PM] Leah Shanker: but it's a truth
[03/05/2008 06:49:54 PM] Leah Shanker: you have to love yourself first before you can love someone else.
[03/05/2008 06:50:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i completely agree
[03/05/2008 06:50:17 PM] Leah Shanker: otherwise, you're entirely incapable of a meaningful relationship
[03/05/2008 06:50:42 PM] Leah Shanker: For the most part
[03/05/2008 06:50:54 PM] Leah Shanker: women are looking for traits in a man that embody what they want to become.
[03/05/2008 06:51:08 PM] Leah Shanker: They love themselves and see their shortcomings and look for men who meet the criteria.
[03/05/2008 06:51:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am afraid that after years of torment from bullies my entire life, i have come to the point where i am so comfortable with who i am that i don't care what other people think of me
[03/05/2008 06:51:44 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, there is a balance.
[03/05/2008 06:52:00 PM] Leah Shanker: If you're too confident, it looks like you're compensating.
[03/05/2008 06:52:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: usually it is a positive thing, but the negative impact it has is i don't care what clothes i wear, and don't dress nice or get my hair cut every month
[03/05/2008 06:52:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not confident, just comfortable
[03/05/2008 06:52:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Looking good only gets you in the door.
[03/05/2008 06:52:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i still can't talk to women
[03/05/2008 06:52:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the door is locked for me
[03/05/2008 06:52:59 PM] Leah Shanker: If you're pulled together, you can get to step one.
[03/05/2008 06:53:14 PM] Leah Shanker: That's probably why Dave meets & gets with a lot of women but then doesn't maintain relationships
[03/05/2008 06:53:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, i am too busy for life stuff
[03/05/2008 06:53:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: like eating and sleeping
[03/05/2008 06:53:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's pretty bad
[03/05/2008 06:53:54 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[03/05/2008 06:53:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i eat about once a day
[03/05/2008 06:54:05 PM] Leah Shanker: not good for you :)
[03/05/2008 06:54:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[03/05/2008 06:54:26 PM] Leah Shanker: And women take time
[03/05/2008 06:54:42 PM] Leah Shanker: especially when you first meet someone
[03/05/2008 06:55:02 PM] Leah Shanker: you have to spend a lot of time courting & being with them, otherwise they'll assume you're not interested
[03/05/2008 06:56:06 PM] Leah Shanker: I see Travis with a Japanese girlfriend.
[03/05/2008 06:56:10 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't know why
[03/05/2008 06:56:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i think i am still stuck on the meeting women stage, like i said before when i am in a relationship with someone i am very accommodating 
[03/05/2008 06:56:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: a foreign chick
[03/05/2008 06:56:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably a good idea
[03/05/2008 06:56:53 PM] Leah Shanker: specifially asian
[03/05/2008 06:57:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are plenty of them around
[03/05/2008 07:00:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i dress nicer more often?
[03/05/2008 07:00:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the t-shirts are no good
[03/05/2008 07:01:18 PM] Leah Shanker: the t-shirts are casual.
[03/05/2008 07:01:24 PM] Leah Shanker: They work for the most part
[03/05/2008 07:01:32 PM] Leah Shanker: it's more impressive if you're more dressed up
[03/05/2008 07:02:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need more casualish-nice clothes
[03/05/2008 07:02:25 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh I would love to take you shopping
[03/05/2008 07:02:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would love to go shopping with you
[03/05/2008 07:02:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could spend daddies money
[03/05/2008 07:02:51 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[03/05/2008 07:02:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe travis could go too
[03/05/2008 07:02:56 PM] Leah Shanker: that's the best kind of money
[03/05/2008 07:03:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: knock out two birds with 1 stone
[03/05/2008 07:03:21 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, he's got to be dressed to the T if he wants to impress a japanese chick :)
[03/05/2008 07:03:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[03/05/2008 07:03:37 PM] Leah Shanker: they're usually pretty decked out
[03/05/2008 07:03:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: not enough women wear skirts
[03/05/2008 07:04:02 PM] Leah Shanker: ahaha
[03/05/2008 07:04:08 PM] Leah Shanker: do you know how impractical they are?
[03/05/2008 07:04:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe that is what makes them so amazing
[03/05/2008 07:04:34 PM] Leah Shanker: I can't focus on the Principles of Languages when I'm worried about whether I'm sitting the right way so people can't see my undies
[03/05/2008 07:05:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: well first, all the desks in the engineering building have a front panel on them, and you can't just cross your legs when sitting, so you have no excuse
[03/05/2008 07:05:26 PM] Leah Shanker: They're pretty much party attire
[03/05/2008 07:05:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i could see that
[03/05/2008 07:05:52 PM] Leah Shanker: ahaha.
[03/05/2008 07:05:58 PM] Leah Shanker: It's cute.
[03/05/2008 07:06:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I will let you into my female brain for a second
[03/05/2008 07:06:26 PM] Leah Shanker: not to get all feminist, because like every other girl, I love to look like a bombshell.
[03/05/2008 07:06:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should have gone to that heaven and hell party i was invited to
[03/05/2008 07:06:40 PM] Leah Shanker: in phoenix?
[03/05/2008 07:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: no up here
[03/05/2008 07:06:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: please continue
[03/05/2008 07:06:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll wait
[03/05/2008 07:07:13 PM] Leah Shanker: but when you look sexy, especially in school/work context
[03/05/2008 07:07:18 PM] Leah Shanker: it's hard to be taken seriously.
[03/05/2008 07:07:26 PM] Leah Shanker: everyone kind of double-checks your intelligent comments
[03/05/2008 07:07:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i love in tv shows where all the women at work wear pushup bras
[03/05/2008 07:07:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, not real.
[03/05/2008 07:07:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's funny
[03/05/2008 07:08:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i love silk dress shirts
[03/05/2008 07:08:29 PM] Leah Shanker: silk? that's so porn.
[03/05/2008 07:08:34 PM] Leah Shanker: bleh.
[03/05/2008 07:08:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: like the kind where it is in between unrefined and shiny
[03/05/2008 07:09:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i disagree the unrefined is really cool, and they are growing in popularity because they don't have to be drycleaned anymore
[03/05/2008 07:09:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i thought of what to wear to a party like that
[03/05/2008 07:09:21 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't know, I'd have to see one.
[03/05/2008 07:09:28 PM] Leah Shanker: the heaven/hell?
[03/05/2008 07:09:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll wear one tomorrow
[03/05/2008 07:09:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[03/05/2008 07:09:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could wear a darkish red shirt with black dress pants
[03/05/2008 07:09:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that combo would look cool
[03/05/2008 07:10:08 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah
[03/05/2008 07:12:49 PM] Leah Shanker: lol. can you imagine if the vice president of ACM showed up in a miniskirt?
[03/05/2008 07:13:06 PM] Leah Shanker: I would most certainly need to repeat everything.
[03/05/2008 07:13:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i certainly like to
[03/05/2008 07:13:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: lolz j/k
[03/05/2008 07:13:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would pay attention to you
[03/05/2008 07:13:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean your face
[03/05/2008 07:13:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: not your miniskirt
[03/05/2008 07:13:49 PM] Leah Shanker: uh huh.
[03/05/2008 07:14:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, not gonna happen :)

[03/05/2008 07:15:32 PM] Leah Shanker: heh, me neither
[03/05/2008 07:15:39 PM] Leah Shanker: i am procrastinating.
[03/05/2008 07:16:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i'll just make a beer run and hit up some wendy's

[03/05/2008 07:56:11 PM] Leah Shanker: hm, that seems like a lot of work
[03/05/2008 07:57:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: not if you have standards from the beginning
[03/05/2008 07:57:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: then every time you add it is easy
[03/05/2008 07:57:26 PM] Leah Shanker: but it will be hard to make you a mixtape
[03/05/2008 07:57:30 PM] Leah Shanker: how about I just give you names?

[03/05/2008 11:48:02 PM] Leah Shanker: also
[03/05/2008 11:48:06 PM] Leah Shanker: 10..> 1
[03/05/2008 11:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow thats not complicated at all
[03/05/2008 11:48:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i just be able to pass in any range and it will count to it?
[03/05/2008 11:48:35 PM] Leah Shanker: yes
[03/05/2008 11:48:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: like 0..-5
[03/05/2008 11:48:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: counts down to 0,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5
[03/05/2008 11:49:11 PM] Leah Shanker: no, 0.. (-5) step -1
[03/05/2008 11:49:13 PM] Leah Shanker: would make that work
[03/05/2008 11:50:01 PM] Leah Shanker: you have to state the step size when you're counting down
[03/05/2008 11:50:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's dumb
[03/05/2008 11:50:31 PM] Leah Shanker: nah, it works.
[03/05/2008 11:50:50 PM] Leah Shanker: that way
[03/05/2008 11:50:55 PM] Leah Shanker: you can put a changing variable into the range
[03/05/2008 11:50:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh do like it
[03/05/2008 11:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: *don't
[03/05/2008 11:51:29 PM] Leah Shanker: it's complicated for the compiler to determine whether you want to count down from there or stop counting.
[03/05/2008 11:51:36 PM] Leah Shanker: so you just have to state it.
[03/05/2008 11:51:44 PM] Leah Shanker: the 1..10 implies a step of 1.
[03/05/2008 11:52:17 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, i'm going to bed
[03/05/2008 11:52:23 PM] Leah Shanker: night night
[03/05/2008 11:52:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if <this>..<that> , and that is less then this than is should count down
[03/05/2008 11:52:43 PM] Leah Shanker: but if <this> is a variable
[03/05/2008 11:52:47 PM] Leah Shanker: that gets changed at runtime.
[03/05/2008 11:53:00 PM] Leah Shanker: sometimes it's greater than <that> and sometimes its less than.
[03/05/2008 11:53:04 PM] Leah Shanker: what then?
[03/05/2008 11:53:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol good point

[03/10/2008 11:46:27 AM] Leah Shanker: which one was that?
[03/10/2008 11:46:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: this show makes meh cry
[03/10/2008 11:46:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: they take out a bunch of base stars and leave new caprica and the admiral has something to command again
[03/10/2008 11:47:14 AM] Leah Shanker: oh yeah :) that was a happy episode
[03/10/2008 11:47:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is kind of allegorical to the other testament 
[03/10/2008 11:48:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: like admiral odama is moses

[03/10/2008 11:48:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i love it
[03/10/2008 11:50:10 AM] Leah Shanker: Have you heard Murphy's justification?
[03/10/2008 11:50:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: "the mass cultural delusion that the suns apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth somehow affects your personality"
[03/10/2008 11:51:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: what did murphy have to say?
[03/10/2008 11:51:07 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it's not about stars.
[03/10/2008 11:51:18 AM] Leah Shanker: It's about the time of year you were born & rasied.
[03/10/2008 11:51:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: so we are just like plants
[03/10/2008 11:51:36 AM] Leah Shanker: Factors do tend to influence personality
[03/10/2008 11:51:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: we grow differently based on the time of year
[03/10/2008 11:51:48 AM] Leah Shanker: In a way, you could say that.
[03/10/2008 11:52:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know plants weren't even considered living in the old testament 
[03/10/2008 11:52:15 AM] Leah Shanker: Oh so that must be true.
[03/10/2008 11:52:27 AM] Leah Shanker: Would you like to hear all the silly things about the Old Testament ors hould we let that one go?
[03/10/2008 11:52:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[03/10/2008 11:52:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are lots of silly things i was just joking
[03/10/2008 11:53:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i saw the article and it reminded me of you, i am just playing devils advocate, i completely believe that there is a correlation between people born at the same time of year
[03/10/2008 11:54:33 AM] Leah Shanker: Have you seen The big Bang Theory?
[03/10/2008 11:54:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: not entirely, it looks pretty funny though
[03/10/2008 11:55:00 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, we should have an ACM sleepover and watch em all
[03/10/2008 11:55:04 AM] Leah Shanker: I've only seen the first few episodes
[03/10/2008 11:55:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: definitely
[03/10/2008 11:55:16 AM] Leah Shanker: For the most part, it's generalized geek humor
[03/10/2008 11:55:21 AM] Leah Shanker: using very classic people in jokes
[03/10/2008 11:55:25 AM] Leah Shanker: like Einstein, etc.
[03/10/2008 11:55:41 AM] Leah Shanker: So even if you're not geeky, you can still find it funny.
[03/10/2008 11:55:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i don't really like sit-coms though
[03/10/2008 11:55:57 AM] Leah Shanker: Scrubs is a sitcom!
[03/10/2008 11:56:13 AM] Leah Shanker: And scrubs makes me laugh so hard.
[03/10/2008 11:56:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: there aren't any laugh tracks
[03/10/2008 11:56:17 AM] Leah Shanker: And cry sometimes.
[03/10/2008 11:56:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love scrubs
[03/10/2008 11:56:22 AM] Leah Shanker: true.
[03/10/2008 11:56:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: but it's not a real sit-com
[03/10/2008 11:56:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: they just act like it
[03/10/2008 11:56:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't even think they have a public audience
[03/10/2008 11:56:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: infact i'm pretty sure they don't
[03/10/2008 11:56:59 AM] Leah Shanker: They don't
[03/10/2008 11:57:21 AM] Leah Shanker: But damn doesn't the really geeky guy just remind you of Dr P?
[03/10/2008 11:57:28 AM] Leah Shanker: on BBT

[04/07/2008 10:05:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope not the girl i was thinking of

[04/07/2008 10:05:45 PM] Leah Shanker: in every other major but CS, lol

[04/07/2008 10:05:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I think environmental actually outnumbers males

[04/07/2008 10:06:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: on facebook
[04/07/2008 10:06:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is really dumb
[04/07/2008 10:07:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: why aren't you feeling well?
[04/07/2008 10:07:31 PM] Leah Shanker: I think it's my ADHD pills.
[04/07/2008 10:07:41 PM] Leah Shanker: no sign that I'm sick otherwise.
[04/07/2008 10:07:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: omg poor girl

[04/07/2008 10:08:07 PM] Leah Shanker: But I don't really like to publicly announce that I'm on medication.
[04/07/2008 10:08:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Strattera
[04/07/2008 10:08:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that what the doctor prescribed?
[04/07/2008 10:08:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Most likely, I'll be switching to something else.
[04/07/2008 10:08:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used to take aderal
[04/07/2008 10:08:30 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah
[04/07/2008 10:08:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the only side effect was loss of appitite
[04/07/2008 10:08:43 PM] Leah Shanker: I wish I could just get one of the known ones.
[04/07/2008 10:08:50 PM] Leah Shanker: that's a sweet side effect, lol
[04/07/2008 10:09:10 PM] Leah Shanker: strattera is rather new, and less effective or so I read online
[04/07/2008 10:09:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should take aderal
[04/07/2008 10:09:26 PM] Leah Shanker: but it's not a stimulant, so they're trying to prescribe it like candy since it's not addictive.
[04/07/2008 10:09:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: aderal took me about a month to get off of
[04/07/2008 10:10:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am probably still ADD, but i used to be a total spaz
[04/07/2008 10:10:23 PM] Leah Shanker: You don't seem that bad right now
[04/07/2008 10:10:31 PM] Leah Shanker: but I guess it doesn't show as much in adults
[04/07/2008 10:10:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't pay attention to anything except what i am interested in
[04/07/2008 10:10:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I'm the same way.
[04/07/2008 10:11:16 PM] Leah Shanker: Ryan's had to IM me sometimes because saying "Leah" doesn't work when I'm totally into something.

[04/10/2008 08:58:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[04/10/2008 08:58:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: because out past experiences make us who we are
[04/10/2008 08:59:16 PM] Leah Shanker: But for all those people who are traumatized beyond all hope of recovery...

[04/11/2008 02:11:37 PM] Leah Shanker: I must learn these skills.
[04/11/2008 03:01:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not just an attidute
[04/11/2008 03:01:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: it an appearance
[04/11/2008 03:01:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to not look intimidating
[04/11/2008 03:02:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're a very intelligent woman, some people find that intimidating
[04/11/2008 03:02:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to be antitimidating
[04/11/2008 03:02:37 PM] Leah Shanker: Yup, my mom says that too.
[04/11/2008 03:03:11 PM] Leah Shanker: She used to deliberately get questions wrong on the tests so she didn't seem as intelligent and downplay her massive intelligence.
[04/11/2008 03:03:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Then she grew up and took a different approach :)
[04/11/2008 03:04:15 PM] Leah Shanker: So here's the double standard: A guy is smart, he's smart. A girl is smart, she's intimidating.

[04/12/2008 04:58:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[04/12/2008 04:58:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i was afraid last night i may have been a little pushy with the drinking
[04/12/2008 04:59:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just wanted people to loosen up
[04/12/2008 04:59:38 PM] Leah Shanker: geeky people don't tend to be very comfortable around new people
[04/12/2008 04:59:52 PM] Leah Shanker: I think your friends are awesome, but strangers scare the boys.
[04/12/2008 05:00:26 PM] Leah Shanker: But don't you dare do anything about it. It's their problem, they should lighten up.
[04/12/2008 05:01:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I think all that's missing from your parties is foods
[04/12/2008 05:01:36 PM] Leah Shanker: But then again, I'm kind of glad you don't have food.
[04/12/2008 05:01:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Makes it easier to avoid.
[04/12/2008 05:02:12 PM] Leah Shanker: But that's actually an idea -

[04/13/2008 09:33:22 PM] Leah Shanker: what can I say? I love being a little homebody.
[04/13/2008 09:33:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: perfect
[04/13/2008 09:33:40 PM] Leah Shanker: what's perfect?
[04/13/2008 09:33:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know she's a convicted criminal just like sony and microsoft
[04/13/2008 09:33:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: your other two favorite companie
[04/13/2008 09:33:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: *companies
[04/13/2008 09:33:57 PM] Leah Shanker: she never put a rootkit on my box :)
[04/13/2008 09:34:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe she put a rootkit on your kitchen
[04/13/2008 09:34:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides you said it was about the principle of it
[04/13/2008 09:34:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: sony never did either
[04/13/2008 09:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: when was the last time you owned a pc?
[04/13/2008 09:35:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't believe that you actually got sony's rootkit
[04/13/2008 09:35:23 PM] Leah Shanker: nope, i've never actually owned a pc.
[04/13/2008 09:35:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used sony software and i don't even know what it is that installed a root kit
[04/13/2008 09:35:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're silly
[04/13/2008 09:35:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: "my box"
[04/13/2008 09:35:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you mean your friends box
[04/13/2008 09:35:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it never actually did any damage
[04/13/2008 09:36:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-P
[04/13/2008 09:36:21 PM] Leah Shanker: remember the analogy though.
[04/13/2008 09:36:35 PM] Leah Shanker: your girl doesn't tell you she's HIV positive
[04/13/2008 09:36:44 PM] Leah Shanker: and you don't end up getting HIV
[04/13/2008 09:37:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i remember
[04/13/2008 09:37:13 PM] Leah Shanker: but you're still feeling like speeding up the virus in her for doing that.
[04/13/2008 09:37:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but martha stewart is just as unethical
[04/13/2008 09:38:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: here's another analogy
[04/13/2008 09:38:23 PM] Leah Shanker: meh, she didn't do much. just bought & sold stocks using information she had.
[04/13/2008 09:38:37 PM] Leah Shanker: didn't hurt anyone, just looking out for herself.
[04/13/2008 09:39:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: some other poor guy could have lost a lot of money because of her though
[04/13/2008 09:39:41 PM] Leah Shanker: naaah, it's not like she was forging documents.
[04/13/2008 09:40:02 PM] Leah Shanker: she just got such a hard judgement because she was in the shadow of the fall of enron & worldcom
[04/13/2008 09:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i suppose
[04/13/2008 09:40:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: but like i said before everyone makes mistakes
[04/13/2008 09:41:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they all did
[04/13/2008 09:41:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they all (except microsoft) apologized and made it right again
[04/13/2008 09:41:38 PM] Leah Shanker: true, and I own a playstation.
[04/13/2008 09:41:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't hold sony accountable for the rootkit because it was just an experience
[04/13/2008 09:41:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh they're accountable.
[04/13/2008 09:42:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would rather it be sony that brings the vulnerability to our attention instead of some virus
[04/13/2008 09:42:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Everyone is accountable.
[04/13/2008 09:42:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: not all the anti-virus programs have like great anti-rootkit support
[04/13/2008 09:42:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, it wasn't sony who brought it forward.
[04/13/2008 09:42:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i blame society
[04/13/2008 09:43:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: not sony
[04/13/2008 09:43:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: poeple pushed them
[04/13/2008 09:43:35 PM] Leah Shanker: My huge pet peeve is the victim attitude.
[04/13/2008 09:43:41 PM] Leah Shanker: People made me do it.
[04/13/2008 09:43:51 PM] Leah Shanker: Joe grates on my nerves all the time with this attitude.
[04/13/2008 09:44:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Sony knew what they were doing.
[04/13/2008 09:44:19 PM] Leah Shanker: They're not the only people plagued by piracy.
[04/13/2008 09:44:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they tried something new
[04/13/2008 09:44:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: it didn't work out and the fixed it
[04/13/2008 09:44:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Right. And it fell through. They're still accountable.
[04/13/2008 09:45:18 PM] Leah Shanker: They're definitely not victims.
[04/13/2008 09:45:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there is a dozen other companies that they have contracts with that were just fine with their solution
[04/13/2008 09:47:34 PM] Leah Shanker: Right, all of which were factors in their conscious decision.
[04/13/2008 09:48:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: martha stewart knew she was breaking the law
[04/13/2008 09:49:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Right, she's not a victim either.
[04/13/2008 09:49:25 PM] Leah Shanker: She made a conscious decision to break the law.
[04/13/2008 09:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should have themed parties
[04/13/2008 09:50:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: people seem to like these "pajama parties"
[04/13/2008 09:50:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds interesting
[04/13/2008 09:51:18 PM] Leah Shanker: pjs are comfy
[04/13/2008 09:51:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess that would be the appeal
[04/13/2008 09:51:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I wore Pjs to your last party
[04/13/2008 09:51:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[04/13/2008 09:52:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you looked so good
[04/13/2008 09:52:04 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe told me they looked like normal pants
[04/13/2008 09:52:08 PM] Leah Shanker: so I got away with it I guess
[04/13/2008 09:52:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally
[04/13/2008 09:52:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you would wear pjs to a party?
[04/13/2008 09:52:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Hells yes.
[04/13/2008 09:52:48 PM] Leah Shanker: You know I'm a dress-up person though.
[04/13/2008 09:52:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I would wear flippin anything given the opportunity.
[04/13/2008 09:53:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm well if you would do it, i bet a lot of people would
[04/13/2008 09:54:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow 3 women that would have a pj party with me

[04/14/2008 11:06:28 AM] Leah Shanker: we have a whole separate atmosphere
[04/14/2008 11:08:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think it's insecurity
[04/14/2008 11:08:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: being repressed by the double standard our society constantly faces
[04/14/2008 11:09:36 AM] Leah Shanker: true, but we're not helpless.
[04/14/2008 11:09:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you tell a guy he is fat even if he's only a little overweight, he will just blow it off
[04/14/2008 11:09:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: most of the time
[04/14/2008 11:10:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you told a woman that, you get a completely different reaction
[04/14/2008 11:10:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: women are not completely hopeless you are right, if they were then i'd be gay

[04/16/2008 09:48:11 AM] Leah Shanker: I bet I can outdrink you.
[04/16/2008 09:48:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: it will be here in time for BSG
[04/16/2008 09:48:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know

[04/16/2008 09:48:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i drink whiskey every day
[04/16/2008 09:48:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: abe doesn't drink whiskey either!
[04/16/2008 09:49:24 AM] Leah Shanker: hm, maybe you have a higher tolerance. and my gender does actually put me at a disadvantage in this case lol
[04/16/2008 09:49:28 AM] Leah Shanker: we shall see.
[04/16/2008 09:49:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: we shall
[04/16/2008 09:50:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so what were you thinking for dinner tonight?
[04/16/2008 09:50:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: i baked some potatoes last night, they were tasty
[04/16/2008 09:50:21 AM] Leah Shanker: :) mmm
[04/16/2008 09:50:26 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, they're pretty easy when you bake them
[04/16/2008 09:50:44 AM] Leah Shanker: when you boil a lot of potatoes, they take a long time and you have to watch that your water doesn't boil over.
[04/16/2008 09:50:54 AM] Leah Shanker: bleh! stick em in the oven!
[04/16/2008 09:51:17 AM] Leah Shanker: ok, so what kind of meat do you have?
[04/16/2008 09:51:22 AM] Leah Shanker: I can center a meal around that
[04/16/2008 09:51:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have beef
[04/16/2008 09:51:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we used all the chicken last time we grilled
[04/16/2008 09:52:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: but we can get more
[04/16/2008 09:52:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: grilled salmon would be good
[04/16/2008 09:52:29 AM] Leah Shanker: are you a big meat person or would you be happy with a savory veggie meal?
[04/16/2008 09:52:36 AM] Leah Shanker: ooh do you have salmon?
[04/16/2008 09:52:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can go get some
[04/16/2008 09:52:49 AM] Leah Shanker: no!
[04/16/2008 09:52:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love salmon though
[04/16/2008 09:52:56 AM] Leah Shanker: this is an exercise in what you've got on hand :)
[04/16/2008 09:53:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's ok, bashes is close
[04/16/2008 09:54:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of veggie meal?
[04/16/2008 09:55:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have an onion, asperagus, and lots of canned tomatoes
[04/16/2008 09:55:46 AM] Leah Shanker: we can make a pasta or rice dish out of those
[04/16/2008 09:55:55 AM] Leah Shanker: Pasta's always delicious
[04/16/2008 09:56:09 AM] Leah Shanker: ooh I can show you how to do the canned tomato sauce
[04/16/2008 09:56:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to go get more pasta
[04/16/2008 09:56:18 AM] Leah Shanker: aw man!
[04/16/2008 09:56:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/16/2008 09:56:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: we can use the new pasta ladle 
[04/16/2008 09:57:13 AM] Leah Shanker: wait!
[04/16/2008 09:57:14 AM] Leah Shanker: haha!
[04/16/2008 09:57:20 AM] Leah Shanker: you have tortillas!
[04/16/2008 09:57:26 AM] Leah Shanker: we could make fajitas/burritos
[04/16/2008 09:57:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes with tomatoe sauce and then salsa topping!
[04/16/2008 09:58:05 AM] Leah Shanker: NOMNOM
[04/16/2008 09:58:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: ridiculous
[04/16/2008 09:58:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to get chicken
[04/16/2008 09:58:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: and rice
[04/16/2008 09:58:20 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/16/2008 09:58:22 AM] Leah Shanker: ok wait
[04/16/2008 09:58:24 AM] Leah Shanker: come get me

[04/16/2008 09:58:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have to work
[04/16/2008 09:58:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: when are you free later?
[04/16/2008 09:58:52 AM] Leah Shanker: i'm free all day, I had class early this morning
[04/16/2008 10:01:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have work until 1 then XML class until 2:40
[04/16/2008 10:01:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe 3?
[04/16/2008 10:01:13 AM] Leah Shanker: sounds good
[04/16/2008 10:12:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://xkcd.com/)http://xkcd.com/
[04/16/2008 10:12:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/16/2008 10:12:52 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/16/2008 10:13:01 AM] Leah Shanker: it's true about sucky techno :)
[04/16/2008 10:18:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: omg the sony oled screen are so hot
[04/16/2008 10:33:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://lifehacker.com/380172/best-dvd-ripping-tools)http://lifehacker.com/380172/best-dvd-ripping-tools(Link: http://lifehacker.com/380172/best-dvd-ripping-tools)
[04/16/2008 10:33:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you see that?
[04/16/2008 10:33:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: ironic is shows up on lifehacker just days after you ask about right?
[04/16/2008 10:33:59 AM] Leah Shanker: haha, seriously
[04/16/2008 10:35:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.dumblittleman.com/2008/04/11-odd-but-simple-ways-to-improve-your.html)http://www.dumblittleman.com/2008/04/11-odd-but-simple-ways-to-improve-your.html
[04/16/2008 10:35:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: did you read that?
[04/16/2008 10:38:32 AM] Leah Shanker: lol, yeah I've heard most of these
[04/16/2008 10:38:52 AM] Leah Shanker: Abe's sister Hannah has a really graphic blog entry on colonoscopies
[04/16/2008 10:38:53 AM] Leah Shanker: eeeew
[04/16/2008 10:39:21 AM] Leah Shanker: besides the fact that it can rupture your colon...it's not medically proven to do anything for your health.
[04/16/2008 10:39:41 AM] Leah Shanker: Hannah & I went on the Master Cleanse fast a while back
[04/16/2008 10:39:56 AM] Leah Shanker: I had to stop a couple days in because my blood pressure was so low that I fainted.
[04/16/2008 10:41:31 AM] Leah Shanker: so yeah, fasts aren't really for me.
[04/16/2008 10:43:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to see the blog
[04/16/2008 10:43:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/16/2008 10:45:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: damnit can't view myspace pictures
[04/16/2008 10:45:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i might just have to sign up again
[04/16/2008 10:48:29 AM] Leah Shanker: (Link: http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=50159809&blogID=279434917&Mytoken=541E33E9-018D-412A-B13E1615F484EB8C2488453)http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=50159809&blogID=279434917&Mytoken=541E33E9-018D-412A-B13E1615F484EB8C2488453
[04/16/2008 10:48:54 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I made a crappy photo-less account that I'm not going to invite friends with.
[04/16/2008 10:49:01 AM] Leah Shanker: Basically so I can access myspace stuff
[04/16/2008 10:49:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/16/2008 10:49:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: via a very lubed up poke in the brown eye
[04/16/2008 10:49:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: she sounds really funny
[04/16/2008 10:49:37 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, she's brilliant
[04/16/2008 10:49:54 AM] Leah Shanker: her blogs usually disturb me, but I can't ever stop reading them lol
[04/16/2008 10:50:09 AM] Leah Shanker: and she's not shy, lol
[04/16/2008 10:51:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: is she older or younger then abe?
[04/16/2008 10:51:52 AM] Leah Shanker: younger
[04/16/2008 10:51:54 AM] Leah Shanker: she's 31
[04/16/2008 10:53:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: so colonics aren't really helpful?
[04/16/2008 10:54:12 AM] Leah Shanker: hollistic medicine people will tell you it is good for overall health, but all the medical studies have shown no real conclusive evidence
[04/16/2008 10:54:18 AM] Leah Shanker: and in fact, it can be very dangerous.
[04/16/2008 10:54:37 AM] Leah Shanker: ruptured colons and the like
[04/16/2008 10:56:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/16/2008 10:56:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: shes pretty
[04/16/2008 10:56:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: i wonder if she likes BSG
[04/16/2008 10:56:44 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, she's gorgeous
[04/16/2008 10:56:46 AM] Leah Shanker: yup
[04/16/2008 10:57:00 AM] Leah Shanker: I don't think she's caught up though
[04/16/2008 10:57:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so about this Crystal girl that "is coming"
[04/16/2008 10:58:03 AM] Leah Shanker: yup
[04/16/2008 10:58:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i could never hook up with someone that dating a friend of mine
[04/16/2008 10:59:10 AM] Leah Shanker: I wasn't suggesting that
[04/16/2008 10:59:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: sure sounded like it
[04/16/2008 10:59:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but good
[04/16/2008 10:59:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: i look forward to meeting her
[04/16/2008 10:59:54 AM] Leah Shanker: So when I was dating this other guy, Matt & I went out to dinner and I sort of realized that I was with the wrong person.
[04/16/2008 11:01:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: wow
[04/16/2008 11:01:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: interesting
[04/16/2008 11:01:41 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, didn't cheat on him or anything, but it seeded the beginning of the end for my past relationship.
[04/16/2008 11:01:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: are john and crystal going to wear pjs and bake cookies with us friday? should we have them or some other people over for dinner tonight?
[04/16/2008 11:02:16 AM] Leah Shanker: sure
[04/16/2008 11:05:30 AM] Leah Shanker: oh and if you want my opinion
[04/16/2008 11:05:38 AM] Leah Shanker: crystal & steve are with the wrong people
[04/16/2008 11:05:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: well thats evident by being "on and off again"
[04/16/2008 11:06:11 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, exactly.
[04/16/2008 11:06:56 AM] Leah Shanker: Steve has told me that he's really just waiting around until either one of them graduates
[04/16/2008 11:07:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was in a similar situation as you, i was with a girl that wanted to make it happen, but we kind of got into it a little to fast, and i met someone up here that i wanted to be with
[04/16/2008 11:07:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i had to break it off, but i ended up having a great relationship that lasted over a year
[04/16/2008 11:08:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was my longest relationship ever, and she was my best girlfriend so far in life
[04/16/2008 11:08:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: my only regret it not being able to make it up to the girl i blew off
[04/16/2008 11:08:44 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, but if you two weren't right, it would have been cruel to stick in a relationship together.
[04/16/2008 11:09:21 AM] Leah Shanker: but that's a recent realization. I used to have a really terrible habit of trying to make failed relationships work.
[04/16/2008 11:09:32 AM] Leah Shanker: Sticking in a relationship that was abusive and/or going nowhere.
[04/16/2008 11:10:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have always supported the idea that if i break up with a girl it will be for good reason, because i will try to work through just about anything, but i could never get back together with someone because i feel we'd always be striving to make the relationship as good as it was and never be able to reach that point
[04/16/2008 11:11:28 AM] Leah Shanker: If she's the right one, it's worth it. My parents dated for years in middle school / high school and broke up for 5 years before getting back together.
[04/16/2008 11:11:57 AM] Leah Shanker: In the mean time, they dated other people, went to parties and had fun. But then they both realized that they had found the perfect person a long time ago.
[04/16/2008 11:12:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess that sounds good, but i am talking about the on and off thing, it just doesn't work
[04/16/2008 11:13:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is on and off with this person, and i love them both but they need to stop trying so hard
[04/16/2008 11:13:32 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it seems fleeting. On/off relationships really are just based on loneliness.
[04/16/2008 11:13:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i could try to phycho-analyze them for hours and still not understand them
[04/16/2008 11:13:53 AM] Leah Shanker: You get into a relationship, realize it doesnt work, leave, and then get lonely.
[04/16/2008 11:15:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is funny when abe leaves his IM on when he is teaching or has his laptop hooked up to the projector
[04/16/2008 11:15:19 AM] Leah Shanker: heh, yeah.
[04/16/2008 11:16:04 AM] Leah Shanker: Why did your favorite relationship end, if that's not too personal a question?
[04/16/2008 11:16:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad you asked i love answering this question
[04/16/2008 11:17:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: we were interested in different things, and our lives were going in different directions.
[04/16/2008 11:17:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: We got along really well, but we had conflicting interests
[04/16/2008 11:18:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: she is a band nerd, and i am a computer programmer, both activities take a lot of time and commitment
[04/16/2008 11:18:25 AM] Leah Shanker: That doesn't seem like a permanent deal-breaker :)
[04/16/2008 11:18:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: we worked at it for a while, and i think when we finally broke it off we both agreed on the term "take a break"
[04/16/2008 11:19:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe someday we will meet up again
[04/16/2008 11:19:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: we still talk, and we still get along
[04/16/2008 11:19:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: we need more veggies for the burritoes/fajitas
[04/16/2008 11:20:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats what we agreed on right?
[04/16/2008 11:20:21 AM] Leah Shanker: Sure! The farmer's market is my favorite place to pick up fresh veggies
[04/16/2008 11:20:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: man i change topics a lot, i am sorry
[04/16/2008 11:20:28 AM] Leah Shanker: they're way cheap and they're grown locally
[04/16/2008 11:20:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: you will have to show me were it is
[04/16/2008 11:20:39 AM] Leah Shanker: k
[04/16/2008 11:21:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you know how to cook fajitas?
[04/16/2008 11:21:43 AM] Leah Shanker: yup
[04/16/2008 11:22:10 AM] Leah Shanker: I like to cut the chicken into strips and then cook it in bbq & jerk sauce
[04/16/2008 11:22:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude we could use the wok as the skillet
[04/16/2008 11:22:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: what time?
[04/16/2008 11:22:37 AM] Leah Shanker: lol. are you sure that's going to work?
[04/16/2008 11:22:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: 7:30?
[04/16/2008 11:22:47 AM] Leah Shanker: sure
[04/16/2008 11:23:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably not
[04/16/2008 11:23:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i have an electric stove
[04/16/2008 11:23:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: but you cook similar ingredients in a wok as you do fajitas
[04/16/2008 11:23:39 AM] Leah Shanker: it's true
[04/16/2008 11:24:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: yay abe is coming
[04/16/2008 11:24:29 AM] Leah Shanker: guacamole!
[04/16/2008 11:24:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh totally
[04/16/2008 11:24:36 AM] Leah Shanker: we needs tha guaca
[04/16/2008 11:24:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: now to invite my roommate
[04/16/2008 11:25:00 AM] Leah Shanker: ooh that probably means megan is coming
[04/16/2008 11:25:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: meals are so much easier to buy food for when you have a plan
[04/16/2008 11:25:28 AM] Leah Shanker: :)
[04/16/2008 11:25:41 AM] Leah Shanker: you're growing up so fast :)
[04/16/2008 11:25:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/16/2008 11:25:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: wtf
[04/16/2008 11:25:52 AM] Leah Shanker: soon you'll be using a shopping cart on instinct :)
[04/16/2008 11:26:03 AM] Leah Shanker: a shopping list AND a shopping cart! hee!
[04/16/2008 11:26:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'm going to have to most amazing list ever
[04/16/2008 11:26:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to watermark it with hello kitty

[04/16/2008 11:30:36 AM] Leah Shanker: We grow up with sex, sheesh.
[04/16/2008 11:31:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[04/16/2008 11:31:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: what was your first rated R movie?
[04/16/2008 11:31:57 AM] Leah Shanker: I don't really remember my first, just my first that I was kept from watching.
[04/16/2008 11:32:08 AM] Leah Shanker: Rated R movies were ok in  my house as long as they werent violent
[04/16/2008 11:32:25 AM] Leah Shanker: but I do remember I wasn't allowed to watch Jurrassic Park with my friends :(
[04/16/2008 11:33:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol its not rated R!
[04/16/2008 11:33:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: sad

[04/16/2008 11:37:20 AM] Leah Shanker: Christ, parents are so scared to expose their children to the inevitabilities of life.

[04/19/2008 03:52:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i forgot
[04/19/2008 03:52:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: a martini party?
[04/19/2008 03:52:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: what that you?
[04/19/2008 03:52:54 PM] Leah Shanker: eh?
[04/19/2008 03:53:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: So why do you guys always leave early?
[04/19/2008 03:53:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you even missed cookies
[04/19/2008 03:53:52 PM] Leah Shanker: eh, not really our scene.
[04/19/2008 03:55:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: what would be your scene?
[04/19/2008 03:55:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: describe your scene?
[04/19/2008 03:55:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i thought we were going to bake
[04/19/2008 03:57:07 PM] Leah Shanker: couple of close friends sitting around a table, playing a fun boardgame or something getting sloshed. pictionary's a good one.
[04/19/2008 03:58:17 PM] Leah Shanker: getting drunk for the sake of getting drunk doesn't really light my fire like it did when I was 15.
[04/19/2008 03:58:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: Yeah, that's not all how i would describe these recent parties.
[04/19/2008 03:59:16 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i'm definitely not saying don't have them.
[04/19/2008 03:59:32 PM] Leah Shanker: but i really did notice most of the people there didn't particularly come for bsg.
[04/19/2008 03:59:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: That's how i could describe a typical college frat party.
[04/19/2008 04:00:23 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah college frat parties aren't my thing.
[04/19/2008 04:00:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: I would say there were maybe 5 people that that didn't come for bsg, yes.  But they did come for being close friends and sitting around talking.  So i think we may have lacked the board games, but everyone there socialized, and drank for the fun of it and to loosen up and relax.
[04/19/2008 04:01:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually 4 people maybe didn't come for BSG, i just got a msg on my wall praising it from someone i counted.
[04/19/2008 04:03:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: And no one that comes to my parties particularly like the frat house parties, that's why they come to mine.
[04/19/2008 04:03:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: I can't wait to go to Defcon, you said those parties are awesome.

[04/20/2008 11:45:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you roast the garlic, and you can use it as a spread
[04/20/2008 11:45:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: on anything

[04/20/2008 11:46:02 PM] Leah Shanker: taters don't go with pasta.

[04/20/2008 11:56:46 PM] Leah Shanker: it's depressing
[04/20/2008 11:56:57 PM] Leah Shanker: you set the tone that every relationship will end
[04/20/2008 11:57:08 PM] Leah Shanker: and it's just a matter of determining when
[04/20/2008 11:57:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm maybe i should put it in reverse
[04/20/2008 11:58:29 PM] Leah Shanker: you bring up very good points but it seems like your outlook is so negative.
[04/20/2008 11:58:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't think so
[04/20/2008 11:59:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: you just say that because you read the ending part at the end

[04/20/2008 11:59:35 PM] Leah Shanker: this is true, but the ending sets the tone of the whole piece.
[04/21/2008 12:00:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes, so if i put the ring of fire section last, the tone should be more neutral

[04/21/2008 12:09:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have another friend that was in a suppressive relationship like that
[04/21/2008 12:10:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think people are like that because they are afraid
[04/21/2008 12:10:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: afraid of rejection, or not finding someone else, or just losing the relationship and being alone
[04/21/2008 12:11:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: how did you relationship end?
[04/21/2008 12:12:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'm sorry, i talk online because i multitask, i was totally following you

[04/23/2008 08:59:18 AM] Leah Shanker: so, sorry.
[04/23/2008 08:59:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: np np
[04/23/2008 09:01:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: i could never be mad at you

[04/23/2008 09:01:42 AM] Leah Shanker: what have we been through?
[04/23/2008 09:01:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: just with the few disputes we had in the past
[04/23/2008 09:02:42 AM] Leah Shanker: true. and now that we run the inner acm council
[04/23/2008 09:02:58 AM] Leah Shanker: we're the nefarious black-cloaked leaders.
[04/23/2008 09:03:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/23/2008 09:03:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: you ever sign up for something, and then leave, and the website still keeps sending you stupid ads, i hate that
[04/23/2008 09:03:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have been using my junk mail blocker so much more, i add all those stupid e-mails to blocked, and never have to see them again
[04/23/2008 09:03:50 AM] Leah Shanker: matt has a cool spam idea for that
[04/23/2008 09:03:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: amazon keeps doing it, so i hope turning it off worked
[04/23/2008 09:04:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[04/23/2008 09:04:00 AM] Leah Shanker: he has his own mailserver, so he makes new aliases when he signs up for stuff
[04/23/2008 09:04:12 AM] Leah Shanker: so he has like a (Link: mailto:paypal@randomcreation.com)paypal@randomcreation.com
[04/23/2008 09:04:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah makes sense
[04/23/2008 09:04:22 AM] Leah Shanker: and like a (Link: mailto:myspace@randomcreation.com)myspace@randomcreation.com
[04/23/2008 09:04:28 AM] Leah Shanker: so he can see where the spam is coming from
[04/23/2008 09:04:36 AM] Leah Shanker: and disable the ones that give him trouble
[04/23/2008 09:05:02 AM] Leah Shanker: too much work for me, i just periodically check my spambox.
[04/23/2008 09:05:03 AM] Leah Shanker: gonna be SO awesome when I don't need to worry about my nau email anymore
[04/23/2008 09:05:03 AM] Leah Shanker: that's the huge culprit
[04/23/2008 09:05:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i haven't gotten around to working all the bugs out of mine, but that is an excellent idea
[04/23/2008 09:05:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i don't either all the spam gets caught or it goes through phases
[04/23/2008 09:05:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i haven't been getting any from nau recently
[04/23/2008 09:05:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: but before it was pretty bad
[04/23/2008 09:06:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: and somehow spammers keep getting my cox account
[04/23/2008 09:06:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that is really bad
[04/23/2008 09:06:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: but it always get caught
[04/23/2008 09:06:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: anywho g2g to wrok
[04/23/2008 09:06:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: *work
[04/23/2008 09:06:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: ttyl
[04/23/2008 09:06:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: should have been at work 6 minutes ago
[04/23/2008 09:08:12 AM] Leah Shanker: cool see ya
[04/23/2008 09:35:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: so when is the study session tonight?
[04/23/2008 09:35:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: 6?
[04/23/2008 09:37:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: so next year when we start mixing in some professional presentations, i think it would be cool to get a little group together to prepare a "how to hack" presentation, maybe advertise it to the other departments or use it as a recruitment
[04/23/2008 09:38:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: it wouldn't have to be anything malicious like people always assume hacking to be, but i think we could come up with some pretty cool examples, maybe get some help from our own linux gurus.
[04/23/2008 09:38:35 AM] Leah Shanker: oh we have the OK from eck
[04/23/2008 09:38:45 AM] Leah Shanker: to actually give hacking demo talks
[04/23/2008 09:39:04 AM] Leah Shanker: it's his philosophy that the more we know, the better we are at defending against it.
[04/23/2008 09:39:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree
[04/23/2008 09:39:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: the whole printer thing lol
[04/23/2008 09:40:01 AM] Leah Shanker: eh, that one is just using someone else's script.
[04/23/2008 09:40:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: no i mean the getting around paying for it
[04/23/2008 09:40:19 AM] Leah Shanker: I was thinking like, how to bypass the throttle on campus
[04/23/2008 09:40:25 AM] Leah Shanker: oh heh
[04/23/2008 09:40:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be another good one
[04/23/2008 09:40:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i could do it if i was wired
[04/23/2008 09:40:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i was on the vpn, using another vpn on top of that wasn't working
[04/23/2008 09:41:50 AM] Leah Shanker: I got around it by using a proxy
[04/23/2008 09:42:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: on the wireless?
[04/23/2008 09:42:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tried that to, and it wasn't working
[04/23/2008 09:42:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i just did it through firefox, not a full on proxy for my connection
[04/23/2008 09:43:00 AM] Leah Shanker: worked for me - channeled everything over a secure proxy and I was able to get OK streaming download.
[04/23/2008 09:43:06 AM] Leah Shanker: bottlenecked by the proxy, but still.
[04/23/2008 09:43:10 AM] Leah Shanker: faster than on campus
[04/23/2008 09:43:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i think a lot of people see hacking as like this amazing ability, so i think it would be easy for us upperclassmen to impress
[04/23/2008 09:45:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i know there must be a way to fix the free printing workaround
[04/23/2008 09:45:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: you could add them to a special DNS where only packets from the printer server are allowed to access them
[04/23/2008 09:46:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: so no matter where you are, if you try an IP connect, it will just block you
[04/23/2008 09:47:26 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, it's possible.
[04/23/2008 09:47:32 AM] Leah Shanker: but I don't think they want to bother with just us.
[04/23/2008 09:47:49 AM] Leah Shanker: and I think it's bullshit that we pay a media fee in our tuition and then have to subsequently pay for copying.
[04/23/2008 09:47:58 AM] Leah Shanker: imho.
[04/23/2008 09:49:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/23/2008 09:57:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: there are so many network exploits on campus too
[04/23/2008 09:57:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: in all 4 years, i have never used their stupid cisco crap
[04/23/2008 09:57:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: *3
[04/23/2008 09:57:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i never will
[04/23/2008 09:58:23 AM] Leah Shanker: heh
[04/23/2008 10:05:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i'll just sex up privoxy on my desktop
[04/23/2008 10:12:18 AM] Leah Shanker: lol

[04/23/2008 10:12:25 AM] Leah Shanker: you gonna make a video or what
[04/23/2008 10:19:09 AM] Leah Shanker: you said sex up privoxy, btw.
[04/23/2008 10:48:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: set

[04/23/2008 02:41:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: not enough features, and i would have to convert over all my buddy aliases
[04/23/2008 02:43:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know why these other ones are so popular, trillian does everything they do and more
[04/23/2008 02:43:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe the open source and cross platformness
[04/23/2008 02:44:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but for windows (and soon Mac) i think trillian has way more features and plugins

[04/24/2008 12:12:39 AM] Leah Shanker: I thought I did by asking Pat for his test
[04/24/2008 12:12:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: at least the first time was his test
[04/24/2008 12:12:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: this one was patricks
[04/24/2008 12:12:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: fucking ridiculous

[04/24/2008 12:14:36 AM] Leah Shanker: He's a fucking leech.
[04/24/2008 12:14:55 AM] Leah Shanker: He comes to the study session so he can suck information from us without giving us a vital piece to help us succeed.
[04/24/2008 12:15:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i don't know what his deal is
[04/24/2008 12:15:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats really weird
[04/24/2008 12:15:12 AM] Leah Shanker: he dangles the possibility of success in front of us and then deliberately withdraws it.
[04/24/2008 12:15:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: that he was so defensive
[04/24/2008 12:15:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/24/2008 12:15:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: well we will do great
[04/24/2008 12:15:52 AM] Leah Shanker: He's made a powerful enemy.
[04/24/2008 12:15:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: i bet we can even do better then him, just because we try a little bit harder
[04/24/2008 12:16:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/24/2008 12:16:38 AM] Leah Shanker: Though it seems like he's so much of a loser as it is that I really can't touch him.
[04/24/2008 12:16:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/24/2008 12:16:58 AM] Leah Shanker: You'll just have to let me vent a little bit longer.
[04/24/2008 12:17:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: oh i am all for it
[04/24/2008 12:17:06 AM] Leah Shanker: I'll go take a xanax and drink some wine
[04/24/2008 12:17:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: ahhh, you can vent to me
[04/24/2008 12:17:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mind
[04/24/2008 12:19:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: he is so effing hard to understand
[04/24/2008 12:20:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: because it elaborates unnecessarily 
[04/24/2008 12:20:23 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I was nice to him before about that.
[04/24/2008 12:20:25 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm going to be calling him on it.
[04/24/2008 12:20:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: and he drones on, he is worse then my monotone
[04/24/2008 12:20:55 AM] Leah Shanker: ahaha, your jolly laugh makes up for your monotone voice
[04/24/2008 12:21:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad to be jolly
[04/24/2008 12:21:24 AM] Leah Shanker: His nasal ramblings make me want to crawl in a hole and die.
[04/24/2008 12:21:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/24/2008 12:21:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i wanted to die when he was explaining the usenet stuff
[04/24/2008 12:21:48 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/24/2008 12:21:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i stopped paying attention
[04/24/2008 12:21:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i WAS interested in it
[04/24/2008 12:22:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: until he started talking
[04/24/2008 12:22:10 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/24/2008 12:23:40 AM] Leah Shanker: Man, effing Tauruses!
[04/24/2008 12:23:51 AM] Leah Shanker: I've run out of Joe content, so here I go onto astrological signs.
[04/24/2008 12:23:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/24/2008 12:23:54 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/24/2008 12:24:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: so did you notice crystal was all shy around me?
[04/24/2008 12:24:19 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/24/2008 12:24:23 AM] Leah Shanker: she's a shy cappy.
[04/24/2008 12:24:39 AM] Leah Shanker: she's reserved and doesn't get upset when people do stupid things - OH WAIT
[04/24/2008 12:24:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: well...
[04/24/2008 12:24:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: that's not all though
[04/24/2008 12:24:58 AM] Leah Shanker: aw, steve was there.
[04/24/2008 12:25:07 AM] Leah Shanker: she's shy in general
[04/24/2008 12:25:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i was talking to steve
[04/24/2008 12:25:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: like we actually talk more now
[04/24/2008 12:25:30 AM] Leah Shanker: heh, cool
[04/24/2008 12:25:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: since i've met his girlfriend
[04/24/2008 12:25:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i'
[04/24/2008 12:25:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: ve  been talking to crystal online
[04/24/2008 12:25:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: or she has been talking at me
[04/24/2008 12:25:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: and the woman won't leave me alone
[04/24/2008 12:26:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: but shes sweet
[04/24/2008 12:26:09 AM] Leah Shanker: lol. Ok I'll say what you want to hear
[04/24/2008 12:26:31 AM] Leah Shanker: She wants your hot Scorpio body and wants to slip into your soul.
[04/24/2008 12:26:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: nice
[04/24/2008 12:26:51 AM] Leah Shanker: But then, I have no idea really.
[04/24/2008 12:27:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: well, she made that somewhat evident
[04/24/2008 12:27:18 AM] Leah Shanker: LOL
[04/24/2008 12:27:28 AM] Leah Shanker: You know who you sound like?
[04/24/2008 12:27:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: ryan
[04/24/2008 12:27:38 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, like every effing guy I know.
[04/24/2008 12:27:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: he uses edivent
[04/24/2008 12:27:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: *evident
[04/24/2008 12:27:51 AM] Leah Shanker: She's shy. Must mean she wants meh.
[04/24/2008 12:27:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: she admitted to, had i asked her to spend the night with me last friday, she would have
[04/24/2008 12:28:00 AM] Leah Shanker: She's talkative! Must mean she wants me.
[04/24/2008 12:28:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/24/2008 12:28:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: but that is just the thing
[04/24/2008 12:28:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: she actually brought up the internet south park recently and was like "do you think since we have been talking online so much that it will be awkward when we see each other again"
[04/24/2008 12:28:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it was awkward
[04/24/2008 12:29:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: probably because she brought it up
[04/24/2008 12:29:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: so, that's why she was shy around me, but she is still talking at me online
[04/24/2008 12:29:49 AM] Leah Shanker: why do you say "at"?
[04/24/2008 12:29:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/24/2008 12:29:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think it sounds funny
[04/24/2008 12:30:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: a 1 sided converstation
[04/24/2008 12:30:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: usually she initializes it
[04/24/2008 12:31:16 AM] Leah Shanker: Hm, a gentleman you are not :)
[04/24/2008 12:32:04 AM] Leah Shanker: "she told me she would spend the night with me had I asked her"
[04/24/2008 12:32:38 AM] Leah Shanker: aw man If I could just make putty out of you and shape you to my will.
[04/24/2008 12:32:54 AM] Leah Shanker: Crystal would be proud :)
[04/24/2008 12:33:26 AM] Leah Shanker: anyway. chill pill kicking in. probably going to sleep now
[04/24/2008 12:33:29 AM] Leah Shanker: good luck tomorrow
[04/24/2008 12:36:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: hey wait, i need a little molding!!!1
[04/24/2008 12:37:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: my edges are a little rough, and i would totally take your advice to heart
[04/24/2008 12:37:26 AM] Leah Shanker: ok
[04/24/2008 12:37:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i shouldn't have mentioned that to you, i thought it was pretty harmless since i would never act on it
[04/24/2008 12:37:46 AM] Leah Shanker: well, to anyone.
[04/24/2008 12:37:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: had it happened, it would have taken some prying
[04/24/2008 12:37:56 AM] Leah Shanker: sexual conquests are never becoming.
[04/24/2008 12:37:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just consider you a close friend
[04/24/2008 12:38:11 AM] Leah Shanker: i hear you :) 
[04/24/2008 12:38:29 AM] Leah Shanker: but a slight hint could do the trick :)
[04/24/2008 12:38:48 AM] Leah Shanker: you really, really should train yourself not to repeat things like that told to you in confidence
[04/24/2008 12:39:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i guess so
[04/24/2008 12:39:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't really consider it a conquest, just evidence that there was some attraction there
[04/24/2008 12:39:37 AM] Leah Shanker: right but I would say
[04/24/2008 12:39:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess spending the night also means something different
[04/24/2008 12:39:39 AM] Leah Shanker: if she admitted something like that to you
[04/24/2008 12:39:43 AM] Leah Shanker: to be a conquest :)
[04/24/2008 12:40:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't consider spending the night to be sexual necessarily 
[04/24/2008 12:40:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe only slightly intimate
[04/24/2008 12:40:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: or maybe just caring
[04/24/2008 12:40:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: that is what i had in mind
[04/24/2008 12:40:31 AM] Leah Shanker: agreed, doesn't necessarily mean sexual
[04/24/2008 12:40:34 AM] Leah Shanker: but still!
[04/24/2008 12:40:37 AM] Leah Shanker: intimate is intimate.
[04/24/2008 12:40:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: intimate is a close personal feeling
[04/24/2008 12:41:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: not necessarily focused on sexuality 
[04/24/2008 12:41:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i looked this word up for my article and it turn out mean what i always thought it meant
[04/24/2008 12:41:34 AM] Leah Shanker: right! but you ruin intimacy when you bring in another person
[04/24/2008 12:41:43 AM] Leah Shanker: contrary to popular pornography, lol
[04/24/2008 12:41:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[04/24/2008 12:42:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i should not share a good experience with anyone?
[04/24/2008 12:42:25 AM] Leah Shanker: yes :) you should relish in it.
[04/24/2008 12:42:48 AM] Leah Shanker: there are times when I've had a really incredible sexual experience
[04/24/2008 12:43:01 AM] Leah Shanker: and I kind of just sit in my seat and pretend to do my daily tasks
[04/24/2008 12:43:23 AM] Leah Shanker: while relishing in the fact that everyone around me doesn't know that I had one fo the most magnificent experiences of my life.
[04/24/2008 12:43:39 AM] Leah Shanker: it's quite empowering.
[04/24/2008 12:43:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: except for that time you told me friday night is date night and a good night for sex
[04/24/2008 12:43:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: and when you were drunk and had sex in the engineering bathroon
[04/24/2008 12:43:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: *bathroom
[04/24/2008 12:44:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm very relishing
[04/24/2008 12:44:25 AM] Leah Shanker: Yes, but getting drunk and having sex on the Engineering Women's bathroom floor
[04/24/2008 12:44:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i thank you for your molding, i will absolutely take that to heart because i don't entirely disagree with you
[04/24/2008 12:44:32 AM] Leah Shanker: is most certainly not my most intimate moment, lol
[04/24/2008 12:44:51 AM] Leah Shanker: it was kind of a fun little thing to do to say we've done it.
[04/24/2008 12:45:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did not consider what she admitted to be any kind of triumph other that a woman being slightly attracted to me, or my mystery
[04/24/2008 12:45:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i guess it can be interpreted differently
[04/24/2008 12:45:44 AM] Leah Shanker: well, here's the thing. it's not mystery when you reveal it :)
[04/24/2008 12:45:56 AM] Leah Shanker: that's why you remember me telling you that!
[04/24/2008 12:46:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i meant her being attracted to my mystery
[04/24/2008 12:46:01 AM] Leah Shanker: see, because I probably shouldn't have, lol.
[04/24/2008 12:46:44 AM] Leah Shanker: I know what you're saying
[04/24/2008 12:47:08 AM] Leah Shanker: But remember, if you're good enough, you won't have to prove it to anyone :)
[04/24/2008 12:47:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/24/2008 12:47:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not good enough
[04/24/2008 12:47:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i am working on it
[04/24/2008 12:47:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: i hope that someday with enough practice i can be perfect
[04/24/2008 12:48:04 AM] Leah Shanker: that's one of the most sincere things I've heard you say.
[04/24/2008 12:48:12 AM] Leah Shanker: well, read you say.
[04/24/2008 12:48:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i knew what you were saying
[04/24/2008 12:49:16 AM] Leah Shanker: I would love to be your Carla.
[04/24/2008 12:49:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would love a carla like you
[04/24/2008 12:49:38 AM] Leah Shanker: Yay!
[04/24/2008 12:49:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that is the most i will ever admit to you
[04/24/2008 12:50:13 AM] Leah Shanker: Good :) We're getting there.
[04/24/2008 12:50:20 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm glad to see you're improving :D
[04/24/2008 12:50:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: i should have said i admit that is the most i will ever admit to you
[04/24/2008 12:50:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: that would be funny and ironic
[04/24/2008 12:50:41 AM] Leah Shanker: no, I'm glad you phrased it the way you did.
[04/24/2008 12:50:55 AM] Leah Shanker: It sounded like I was making progress with you.
[04/24/2008 12:51:12 AM] Leah Shanker: And progress is a Capricorn's drug of choice.
[04/24/2008 12:51:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[04/24/2008 12:51:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i really need to read into that stuff
[04/24/2008 12:51:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we would be able to intuitively understand each other more
[04/24/2008 12:51:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that is my drug of choice
[04/24/2008 12:52:09 AM] Leah Shanker: I know about you little scorpios
[04/24/2008 12:52:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: when someone can understand me right off the bat thinking logically like me
[04/24/2008 12:52:39 AM] Leah Shanker: So I read that Scorpios love to pry.
[04/24/2008 12:53:01 AM] Leah Shanker: You love to delve down deep, to know your deep hidden secrets you won't tell a soul.
[04/24/2008 12:53:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that does describe me
[04/24/2008 12:53:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i have gotten good at it
[04/24/2008 12:53:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: but ironically my dad is good at that to, he is july 9th
[04/24/2008 12:54:11 AM] Leah Shanker: Cancer
[04/24/2008 12:54:12 AM] Leah Shanker: interesting

[04/24/2008 12:54:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: funny story about a childhood experience i will tell you next time it comes up
[04/24/2008 12:54:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think he's manic depressant 
[04/24/2008 12:55:07 AM] Leah Shanker: haha, you really should read about Cancers.
[04/24/2008 12:55:17 AM] Leah Shanker: they're described exactly like that.
[04/24/2008 12:55:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/24/2008 12:55:31 AM] Leah Shanker: They're so happy when they're happy but then they'll lock themselves in their rooms and cry for days.

[04/24/2008 12:58:07 AM] Leah Shanker: though it does sound like you need no help in that department
[04/24/2008 12:58:15 AM] Leah Shanker: But I don't know that because you never told me :)

[04/25/2008 04:08:42 PM] Leah Shanker: plus that also means megan
[04/25/2008 04:08:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/25/2008 04:08:58 PM] Leah Shanker: lately though his parties are awkward.
[04/25/2008 04:09:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said she was going to be in phoenix
[04/25/2008 04:09:09 PM] Leah Shanker: oh ok
[04/25/2008 04:09:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think they are the same, but 1 difference i notices
[04/25/2008 04:09:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: *notice is we have to compensate for non CS people being there
[04/25/2008 04:09:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we attempt to tone down the nerdy, but we end up dividing the conversation
[04/25/2008 04:10:05 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, that's not what bothers me though
[04/25/2008 04:10:14 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm cool with toning down CS when outside of 105
[04/25/2008 04:10:34 PM] Leah Shanker: but, it's just that when Abe & megan are together and throwing a party
[04/25/2008 04:10:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe doesn't really act like a host, he kind of just makes out with megan in the kitchen.
[04/25/2008 04:10:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Which is cute, but not why I came.
[04/25/2008 04:10:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/25/2008 04:11:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is exactly why bachelors throw the best parties!!!1
[04/25/2008 04:11:09 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, srsly.
[04/25/2008 04:11:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i rule
[04/25/2008 04:11:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: j/k
[04/25/2008 04:11:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg so you should come
[04/25/2008 04:12:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i'll tell you why
[04/25/2008 04:12:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Go on...
[04/25/2008 04:12:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i still have to talk to steve
[04/25/2008 04:12:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you don't come, and i keep talking to crystal, i am totally going to fall head over heals for her
[04/25/2008 04:12:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i can't let that happen
[04/25/2008 04:12:53 PM] Leah Shanker: you'll still fall for her whether I'm there or not :)
[04/25/2008 04:13:43 PM] Leah Shanker: plus you know how I feel about it - steve has been just postponing the inevitable.
[04/25/2008 04:13:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but you should be like my wingman
[04/25/2008 04:14:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: except do the opposite and deter me from women
[04/25/2008 04:14:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: or woman
[04/25/2008 04:14:36 PM] Leah Shanker: i dunno, i think you two would be great together.
[04/25/2008 04:14:46 PM] Leah Shanker: i would make a terrible non-wingman.
[04/25/2008 04:15:12 PM] Leah Shanker: but then
[04/25/2008 04:15:17 PM] Leah Shanker: i do think you should keep it subtle.
[04/25/2008 04:15:48 PM] Leah Shanker: if you tempt her and show her what a wonderful guy you are, you'll probably start the cycle where she starts to tell steve what she's been wanting to tell him for a long time.
[04/25/2008 04:15:59 PM] Leah Shanker: but maybe i'm just projecting myself onto her.
[04/25/2008 04:16:25 PM] Leah Shanker: but if you give in to emotion and do something that would really anger steve
[04/25/2008 04:16:44 PM] Leah Shanker: then you'll most certainly ruin not only your friendship with steve, but also your chance with crystal.
[04/25/2008 04:17:15 PM] Leah Shanker: so subtle flirting I think should be your strategy.
[04/25/2008 04:17:28 PM] Leah Shanker: or maybe not so subtle.
[04/25/2008 04:17:43 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, i'm gonna work on prince.
[04/25/2008 04:17:59 PM] Leah Shanker: maybe see you tonight, we'll see what happens.
[04/25/2008 04:18:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: sry i was preparing a snack, let me read
[04/25/2008 04:20:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope you come tonight, i believe i have showed her who i am, we hung out today a little bit preparing the jello shots, and i plan on talking to steve soon and just mentioning that i have no intention of destroying their relationship
[04/25/2008 04:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been encouraging her to work it out with steve, so maybe i destroyed my chances, but the important thing is that everyone follows their heart and is happy
[04/25/2008 04:21:48 PM] Leah Shanker: that took real honor and guts, to tell her that.
[04/25/2008 04:22:15 PM] Leah Shanker: and you're absolutely right.
[04/25/2008 04:29:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: talked to steve and everything is totally chill
[04/25/2008 04:29:58 PM] Leah Shanker: excellent, i knew it would be :)
[04/25/2008 04:30:09 PM] Leah Shanker: what did he say?
[04/25/2008 04:30:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it seems like not he wants the relationship to work, crystal wants to take a break
[04/25/2008 04:31:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: he was actually a little concerned about keifer making a move on her
[04/25/2008 04:31:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: which would not be unlike keifer
[04/25/2008 04:31:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: because keifer is an ass
[04/25/2008 04:31:11 PM] Leah Shanker: isn't he seeing joanna?
[04/25/2008 04:31:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[04/25/2008 04:31:25 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, crystal's smart though :)
[04/25/2008 04:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he does stuff behind her back then appologizes
[04/25/2008 04:31:53 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, he seems ridiculously immature.
[04/25/2008 04:32:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/25/2008 04:32:19 PM] Leah Shanker: which is really fun when I'm drunk, so I guess he's an excellent drunk friend.
[04/25/2008 04:32:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/25/2008 04:32:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is generally a good person
[04/25/2008 04:32:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he reminds me of my dad when it comes to relationships and being selfish
[04/25/2008 04:34:00 PM] Leah Shanker: hm, keifer is a virgo.
[04/25/2008 04:34:11 PM] Leah Shanker: that's strange, I normally really get along with virgos.
[04/25/2008 04:34:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: my dad is july 9th
[04/25/2008 04:34:40 PM] Leah Shanker: cancer
[04/25/2008 04:34:47 PM] Leah Shanker: they're known for being immature.
[04/25/2008 04:34:59 PM] Leah Shanker: but virgo is usually very mature.
[04/25/2008 04:34:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be my dad
[04/25/2008 04:35:09 PM] Leah Shanker: virgo is usually the most logical sign.
[04/25/2008 04:35:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[04/25/2008 04:35:35 PM] Leah Shanker: interesting. keifer kind of intrigues me now.
[04/25/2008 04:35:50 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm always fascinated when i meet someone who i can't really pin down.
[04/25/2008 04:35:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: he should be over tonight if you guys stop buy
[04/25/2008 04:36:05 PM] Leah Shanker: the debate is still going on.
[04/25/2008 04:36:11 PM] Leah Shanker: abe is pretty stubborn.
[04/25/2008 04:36:17 PM] Leah Shanker: so i imagine he may not come anyway.
[04/25/2008 04:36:21 PM] Leah Shanker: but we'll see
[04/25/2008 04:36:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/25/2008 04:36:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tried to make it more Abe themed just for him!
[04/25/2008 04:37:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you can copy that to him
[04/25/2008 04:37:11 PM] Leah Shanker: don't worry, i'm on your side.
[04/25/2008 04:37:45 PM] Leah Shanker: but when abe gets an idea in his head, he usually won't let go.
[04/25/2008 04:38:04 PM] Leah Shanker: one of the clashing points between us.
[04/25/2008 04:38:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was thinking of other themes, maybe having a rave theme (just to bring back highschool memories), and katrina mentioned an "anything but clothes" theme, so you have to wear something creative
[04/25/2008 04:38:47 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/25/2008 04:38:48 PM] Leah Shanker: fun!
[04/25/2008 04:39:05 PM] Leah Shanker: we could make candy and buy glowsticks
[04/25/2008 04:39:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and one other that i know you would like, but other people i don't think would play along with, a Victorian theme
[04/25/2008 04:39:21 PM] Leah Shanker: ooooh. you know i would dig it.
[04/25/2008 04:39:33 PM] Leah Shanker: but then, that is pretty expensive.
[04/25/2008 04:39:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah me and dave too, but you are right
[04/25/2008 04:40:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think the rave with a strobe light and fog machine and glow sticks
[04/25/2008 04:40:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: for the last party of the year
[04/25/2008 04:40:35 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh i have to buy some rave pants.
[04/25/2008 04:40:43 PM] Leah Shanker: when is this?
[04/25/2008 04:40:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it would be next week
[04/25/2008 04:40:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't know
[04/25/2008 04:40:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not the best time
[04/25/2008 04:40:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: since people will be studying
[04/25/2008 04:41:01 PM] Leah Shanker: wait, you're not here over the summer?
[04/25/2008 04:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will be for some of it yes
[04/25/2008 04:43:13 PM] Leah Shanker: oh but you're coming to defcon.
[04/25/2008 04:43:19 PM] Leah Shanker: that will be the most fun you'll have all year :)
[04/25/2008 04:43:26 PM] Leah Shanker: and I promise you that.
[04/25/2008 04:44:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably
[04/25/2008 04:44:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: except for maybe getting high with my dad and my cousin that i haven't seen for like 5 years
[04/25/2008 04:45:51 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/25/2008 04:46:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because it is bonding time
[04/25/2008 04:46:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: which reminds me i should smoke tonight for the practice
[04/25/2008 04:46:28 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[04/25/2008 04:46:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/mediaserver/plugins/m3u.php)http://209.250.30.30/mediaserver/plugins/m3u.php

[04/25/2008 04:47:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: which itunes should be able to read
[04/25/2008 04:47:41 PM] Leah Shanker: damn that's awesome
[04/25/2008 04:48:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: which reminds me i need to write a script to copy a playlist songs into a folder
[04/25/2008 04:48:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can copy it to the playstation
[04/25/2008 04:48:35 PM] Leah Shanker: nice!
[04/25/2008 04:48:55 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, scrolling through your library really does take a long time cos you have so much stuff
[04/25/2008 04:49:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will have to just start copying over the artists we want
[04/25/2008 04:49:45 PM] Leah Shanker: can you use your playlist generator to grab certain songs?
[04/25/2008 04:50:00 PM] Leah Shanker: like sometimes I have the sudden craving to listen to a certain song
[04/25/2008 04:50:08 PM] Leah Shanker: and it would be awesome to just search for it
[04/25/2008 04:50:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes by filling in the contains field, then select Limit None
[04/25/2008 04:50:21 PM] Leah Shanker: nice!
[04/25/2008 05:19:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is all your fault
[04/25/2008 05:20:20 PM] Leah Shanker: :) and proud of it. i'd love to see you two together.
[04/25/2008 05:20:58 PM] Leah Shanker: she's really hot plus she's a math major.
[04/25/2008 05:21:04 PM] Leah Shanker: which mean she'll end up being a programmer.
[04/25/2008 05:21:09 PM] Leah Shanker: she's perfect for you.
[04/25/2008 05:23:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yay my script works
[04/25/2008 05:23:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah she is totally amazing
[04/25/2008 05:23:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: she keeps surprising me with her knowledge of stuff
[04/25/2008 05:23:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: she picked out a strawberry jello, and immediately called it rawberry right off the bat
[04/25/2008 05:23:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was totally amused
[04/25/2008 05:25:22 PM] Leah Shanker: :) aw, i am anxious to see what's going to happen.
[04/25/2008 05:25:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably nothing
[04/25/2008 05:25:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: my luck always turns out like that
[04/25/2008 05:25:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can hope for the best, but i prepare for the worst
[04/25/2008 05:26:12 PM] Leah Shanker: true, i shouldn't be pumping you up about this quite yet.
[04/25/2008 05:26:28 PM] Leah Shanker: but omfg it would be so cute.
[04/25/2008 05:30:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, and you would totally be responsible for create a great relationship
[04/25/2008 05:30:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: playing matchmaker
[04/25/2008 05:30:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: you little cupid
[04/25/2008 05:30:53 PM] Leah Shanker: :)
[04/25/2008 05:36:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am in the mood for soft pansy music
[04/25/2008 05:36:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: something i would not usually listen to
[04/25/2008 05:36:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you know i am hard core
[04/25/2008 05:37:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[04/25/2008 05:38:07 PM] Leah Shanker: ok
[04/25/2008 05:38:12 PM] Leah Shanker: what kind of soft pansy music?
[04/25/2008 05:38:34 PM] Leah Shanker: i've got antiquated vocals (victorian poetry)
[04/25/2008 05:38:47 PM] Leah Shanker: hm also, chill electronic
[04/25/2008 05:38:57 PM] Leah Shanker: or like, romantic love songs

[04/25/2008 05:40:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol like frakin norah jones
[04/25/2008 05:40:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i feel so gay
[04/25/2008 05:40:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i shouldn't be admitting any of this to you
[04/25/2008 05:40:52 PM] Leah Shanker: this is ok to admit to females.
[04/25/2008 05:40:57 PM] Leah Shanker: if I was a guy, I would agree with you.
[04/25/2008 05:41:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to remain strong, bold, and thick in everyones eyes
[04/25/2008 05:41:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: in penetrable 
[04/25/2008 05:41:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: impenetrable 
[04/25/2008 05:41:29 PM] Leah Shanker: that's a very masculine hero :)
[04/25/2008 05:41:45 PM] Leah Shanker: but all guys let down their guards when they talk to females.
[04/25/2008 05:41:52 PM] Leah Shanker: we get to see the soft side.
[04/25/2008 05:41:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i suppose so
[04/25/2008 05:42:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only have a few close female friends
[04/25/2008 05:42:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess that is typical of scorio
[04/25/2008 05:42:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: *scorpio
[04/25/2008 05:42:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and even fewer of them have seen any soft side of me
[04/25/2008 05:43:19 PM] Leah Shanker: you should let them in sometime, we're very good at showing you how to feel :)
[04/25/2008 05:43:41 PM] Leah Shanker: speaking of which, i have songs for you
[04/25/2008 05:43:47 PM] Leah Shanker: secretive songs I won't tell the boys I sent you
[04/25/2008 05:44:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol you don't have to send them just list them and i'll go get them
[04/25/2008 05:44:12 PM] Leah Shanker: ok!
[04/25/2008 05:46:20 PM] Leah Shanker: here's my mood music, it's great for romancing and/or sipping a glass of wine on the couch
[04/25/2008 05:46:38 PM] *** Leah Shanker wants to directly connect.
[04/25/2008 05:46:41 PM] *** Leah Shanker is now directly connected.
[04/25/2008 05:46:41 PM] Leah Shanker: 
[04/25/2008 05:46:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should make a playlist for each mood
[04/25/2008 05:46:52 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, that's what I do
[04/25/2008 05:47:10 PM] Leah Shanker: here's a melancholy one. mostly for breakups, feeling down, etc.
[04/25/2008 05:47:45 PM] Leah Shanker: 
[04/25/2008 05:47:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks it will take my a little while to collect it all but i definitely see some good stuff i want to get
[04/25/2008 05:48:07 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, i'll give you more when you want it.
[04/25/2008 05:48:16 PM] Leah Shanker: zero 7 is great.
[04/25/2008 05:48:18 PM] Leah Shanker: all around
[04/25/2008 05:48:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[04/25/2008 05:49:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i can default to music a little more often instead of whiskey
[04/25/2008 05:49:36 PM] Leah Shanker: yay :)
[04/25/2008 05:49:53 PM] Leah Shanker: good for your liver, emotional health, and your body.
[04/25/2008 05:49:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i do need some more whiskey
[04/25/2008 05:50:05 PM] Leah Shanker: makes ya feel better!
[04/25/2008 05:50:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol yeah
[04/25/2008 05:52:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: mMm tasty jello
[04/25/2008 05:53:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wonder if there is a cooler way i can prepare these
[04/25/2008 05:53:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: like cut off most of the cup and stack them
[04/25/2008 05:54:12 PM] Leah Shanker: cool whip, nom nom
[04/25/2008 05:54:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yum!
[04/25/2008 05:55:32 PM] Leah Shanker: i've never had jello shots that weren't made with really hard alcohol (everclear)
[04/25/2008 05:55:36 PM] Leah Shanker: this should be interesting
[04/25/2008 05:59:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i tried to even it out so that each show is about 10% alcohol
[04/25/2008 05:59:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: everlcear would be too strong
[04/25/2008 05:59:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: you would have to start drinking, and then do them
[04/25/2008 05:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used malibu, 99 bananas, and champagne
[04/25/2008 05:59:42 PM] Leah Shanker: nom nom nom

[04/26/2008 05:15:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: you were pretty gone last night, you know you finished that entire bottle of wine yourself
[04/26/2008 05:15:15 PM] Leah Shanker: haha. not to mention half your jello shots.
[04/26/2008 05:15:27 PM] Leah Shanker: and um, i'm sorry about being belligerent to your upstairs neighbors.
[04/26/2008 05:15:41 PM] Leah Shanker: i think megan smoothed it over with them.
[04/26/2008 05:15:51 PM] Leah Shanker: in my defense, however, they were assholes right off the bat
[04/26/2008 05:16:09 PM] Leah Shanker: they didn't say something nice like "hey, could you please possibly turn that down?"
[04/26/2008 05:16:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah they are assholes
[04/26/2008 05:16:28 PM] Leah Shanker: they just started screaming about how old everyone is and that they're going to call the cops.
[04/26/2008 05:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: no worries, i'll talk to them one of these days
[04/26/2008 05:17:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh and i also wanted to say, it's all your fault
[04/26/2008 05:17:55 PM] Leah Shanker: good :)
[04/26/2008 05:18:08 PM] Leah Shanker: yay, are you officially dating yet?
[04/26/2008 05:18:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish
[04/26/2008 05:18:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we are in a whole mess of trouble
[04/26/2008 05:19:49 PM] Leah Shanker: but you talked to steve, right?
[04/26/2008 05:19:56 PM] Leah Shanker: things should be ok, i hope.
[04/26/2008 05:20:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to him
[04/26/2008 05:20:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but not about that
[04/26/2008 05:21:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: he still wants to be with her
[04/26/2008 05:21:40 PM] Leah Shanker: hrmmm
[04/26/2008 05:22:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she wants to be with me, just not enough to leave steve
[04/26/2008 05:23:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am crazy about her
[04/26/2008 05:23:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but enough about my problems
[04/26/2008 05:23:55 PM] Leah Shanker: aw :)
[04/26/2008 05:24:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: how are you doing?
[04/26/2008 05:24:01 PM] Leah Shanker: I think it will work out.
[04/26/2008 05:24:20 PM] Leah Shanker: there may be some tension for a while, but it will all work out in the end.
[04/26/2008 05:24:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: any way that it works out is not good for steve, so i feel kind of bad about that
[04/26/2008 05:25:15 PM] Leah Shanker: patience is your key to this problem.
[04/26/2008 05:25:38 PM] Leah Shanker: if it works out the way you want it to, it will be over time.
[04/26/2008 05:25:47 PM] Leah Shanker: slowly - i do think that's best.
[04/26/2008 05:26:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not the only one with a problem being patient
[04/26/2008 05:27:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I hear you, she's probably feeling just the same as you are.
[04/26/2008 05:28:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but the difference is, i wouldn't have acted on it
[04/26/2008 05:30:01 PM] Leah Shanker: wuh oh, did you do something you're going to regret later?
[04/26/2008 05:30:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't do anything
[04/26/2008 05:30:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is the problem, i didn't stop it
[04/26/2008 05:30:57 PM] Leah Shanker: hmm, this makes things tricky.
[04/26/2008 05:32:46 PM] Leah Shanker: brian, brian, brian you bad little boy.
[04/26/2008 05:33:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-Z
[04/26/2008 05:33:07 PM] Leah Shanker: :)
[04/26/2008 05:33:32 PM] Leah Shanker: ugh, you shouldn't dwell on it now though.
[04/26/2008 05:33:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[04/26/2008 05:33:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[04/26/2008 05:34:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think everything is good
[04/26/2008 05:34:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will all work out like you said
[04/26/2008 05:35:29 PM] Leah Shanker: i agree, it will work out. but slow down and be patient and resist.
[04/26/2008 05:38:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: she invited me to the movie
[04/26/2008 05:38:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think tonight can be an excellent display of that

[04/26/2008 08:00:02 PM] Leah Shanker: heh, how did that come up?
[04/26/2008 08:00:08 PM] Leah Shanker: you don't have black eyes
[04/26/2008 08:01:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: not yet
[04/26/2008 08:01:32 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, wait what?
[04/26/2008 08:01:44 PM] Leah Shanker: are you planning on taking e  lol?
[04/26/2008 08:02:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: a black eye like a bruise
[04/26/2008 08:02:33 PM] Leah Shanker: uh oh, are you ok?
[04/26/2008 08:02:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: currently yes
[04/26/2008 08:03:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: next time steve sees me, probably not
[04/26/2008 08:03:38 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/26/2008 08:03:46 PM] Leah Shanker: don't dwell on it, no good obsessing about it now.
[04/26/2008 08:03:50 PM] Leah Shanker: it will only ruin your day.
[04/26/2008 08:05:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am talking to steve
[04/26/2008 08:05:21 PM] Leah Shanker: right now?
[04/26/2008 08:05:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 08:05:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: she knows everything
[04/26/2008 08:05:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and now i am not talking to steve
[04/26/2008 08:05:55 PM] Leah Shanker: he?
[04/26/2008 08:06:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know he was planning to marry her?
[04/26/2008 08:06:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I had never heard that
[04/26/2008 08:07:09 PM] Leah Shanker: it doesn't surprise me though, they've been together for years.
[04/26/2008 08:07:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 08:07:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i went and fraked it all up
[04/26/2008 08:07:51 PM] Leah Shanker: it's not your fault, you know.
[04/26/2008 08:07:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably not
[04/26/2008 08:08:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i made it worse
[04/26/2008 08:08:06 PM] Leah Shanker: crystal had wanted out for a while now
[04/26/2008 08:08:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: true
[04/26/2008 08:16:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: how long were you an matt together before he asked you to marry him?
[04/26/2008 08:18:10 PM] Leah Shanker: two and a half years. and it was mostly because i coerced him.
[04/26/2008 08:19:14 PM] Leah Shanker: it's kind of a long story
[04/26/2008 08:19:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope i hear it before i die
[04/26/2008 08:22:40 PM] Leah Shanker: i am talking to steve.
[04/26/2008 08:23:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is furious
[04/26/2008 08:23:48 PM] Leah Shanker: yes, this i had forseen. but you may have entirely ruined your chances with her.
[04/26/2008 08:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: how so?
[04/26/2008 08:25:40 PM] Leah Shanker: she apparently has told him that even after last night, she doesn't really want to break up with steve, but she's also not talking to him.
[04/26/2008 08:26:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes she told me she doesn't want to break up with him
[04/26/2008 08:26:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: how does he feel?
[04/26/2008 08:26:36 PM] Leah Shanker: he's incredibly pissed off, understandably.
[04/26/2008 08:26:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/26/2008 08:28:50 PM] Leah Shanker: you probably shouldn't comment on their relationship...
[04/26/2008 08:29:07 PM] Leah Shanker: that will most certainly get you a black eye.
[04/26/2008 08:30:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only know what crystal has told me, if i end up as a punching bag, at least i may have helped by relay that information to him
[04/26/2008 08:31:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: *relaying
[04/26/2008 08:31:31 PM] Leah Shanker: i don't think you're the best source.
[04/26/2008 08:31:43 PM] Leah Shanker: crystal should probably tell him that.
[04/26/2008 08:31:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: she most certainly is for sure
[04/26/2008 08:32:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't seem like it is going to happen
[04/26/2008 08:34:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i told him, and he probably didn't comprehend this because of his anger, i have been in full support of their relationship up until last night
[04/26/2008 08:36:46 PM] Leah Shanker: he said you called him before the party and told him there's nothing going on between you and crystal.
[04/26/2008 08:36:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there wasn't
[04/26/2008 08:38:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: at least there wasn't anything i would act on, i didn't intend for any of this to happen, and i certainly didn't intend to upset him, but it just kind of happened, and my only regret is making him angry
[04/26/2008 08:39:00 PM] Leah Shanker: and you've probably made a very rocky start between you and crystal - doesn't bode well.
[04/26/2008 08:39:19 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm sorry, you probably know that.
[04/26/2008 08:39:26 PM] Leah Shanker: ugh brian!
[04/26/2008 08:39:33 PM] Leah Shanker: i really really wish you had stopped her.
[04/26/2008 08:40:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: there wasn't even any flirting before hand, we acted on mindless passion
[04/26/2008 08:40:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i now wish i had stopped her too, but neither of us were using our heads
[04/26/2008 08:42:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i care more about his relationship with her, then my relationship with her
[04/26/2008 08:42:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: if she leaves him, i don't think i could be with her
[04/26/2008 08:45:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would take a lot of love
[04/26/2008 08:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know...
[04/26/2008 08:45:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't feel like a good person
[04/26/2008 08:48:24 PM] Leah Shanker: you're still a good person, just maybe not such a great friend.
[04/26/2008 08:48:56 PM] Leah Shanker: come out with me tonight, we'll see a funny movie and we'll sleep on it.
[04/26/2008 08:49:02 PM] Leah Shanker: you'll feel better about it in the morning.
[04/26/2008 08:49:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i knew steve i think things would have been different
[04/26/2008 08:50:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: before his girlfriend came into the picture he never initialized a conversation with me
[04/26/2008 08:50:54 PM] Leah Shanker: he's a pretty quiet & shy guy until you've known him for a while
[04/26/2008 08:51:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember when i made some misinterpreted comments about you last semester, and matt was annoyed with me?  when matt and i started talking just from us hanging out, i made us all closer
[04/26/2008 08:51:55 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, is this your way of making friends? :P
[04/26/2008 08:52:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, interesting
[04/26/2008 08:52:40 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm just kidding you silly.
[04/26/2008 08:53:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: me too
[04/26/2008 08:57:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: dave was friends with steve
[04/26/2008 08:57:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so he is pissed at me too
[04/26/2008 08:58:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is completely understandable
[04/26/2008 08:58:58 PM] Leah Shanker: you're going to have to stop beating yourself up about this eventually.
[04/26/2008 08:59:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't really remember last night and did some pretty stupid stuff too.
[04/26/2008 08:59:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not beating myself up about it, i guess i stuff feel bad for steve
[04/26/2008 09:00:05 PM] Leah Shanker: He had tried to break up with her a month back...
[04/26/2008 09:00:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Obviously he's probably pissed about it now, but in the long run I think he's better off.
[04/26/2008 09:01:14 PM] Leah Shanker: As your unofficial secret cupid, I would have wanted Crystal to break it off with Steve before being with you...
[04/26/2008 09:01:47 PM] Leah Shanker: but, this will heal in time and everything will work out like it should.
[04/26/2008 09:03:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[04/26/2008 09:05:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have never been a supporter of being in a relationship just because you can, everyone should have the experience to determine what they want, and it seems neither of these two had the experience to do that
[04/26/2008 09:05:31 PM] Leah Shanker: I completely agree.
[04/26/2008 09:07:40 PM] Leah Shanker: So are you coming tonight?
[04/26/2008 09:07:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i suppose
[04/26/2008 09:07:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but everyone is going to think i am a bad person
[04/26/2008 09:08:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and blame me
[04/26/2008 09:08:10 PM] Leah Shanker: no way
[04/26/2008 09:08:37 PM] Leah Shanker: abe just asked about it, and he thinks you're in the right.
[04/26/2008 09:08:59 PM] Leah Shanker: poor execution, but people who are not in great relationships shouldn't be.
[04/26/2008 09:09:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to send my conversation to steve
[04/26/2008 09:11:10 PM] Leah Shanker: ?

[04/27/2008 01:44:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: does that show up as a heart?
[04/27/2008 01:44:23 PM] Leah Shanker: nope!

[04/27/2008 01:44:54 PM] Leah Shanker: nope, this one does tho
[04/27/2008 01:45:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: where?
[04/27/2008 01:45:38 PM] Leah Shanker: crap the one on the i heart huckabees page does.
[04/27/2008 01:45:45 PM] Leah Shanker: i can't copy it though, since it's in the title.
[04/27/2008 01:45:50 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, how are you doing?
[04/27/2008 01:46:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: *sigh*
[04/27/2008 01:46:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[04/27/2008 01:48:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: how are you?
[04/27/2008 01:49:01 PM] Leah Shanker: wretched.
[04/27/2008 01:49:17 PM] Leah Shanker: I feel somewhat responsible for what happened and now I'm helping steve through it.
[04/27/2008 01:49:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is a pretty strong word
[04/27/2008 01:49:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: but don't take the blame
[04/27/2008 01:49:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is he doing?
[04/27/2008 01:49:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: still upset?
[04/27/2008 01:50:10 PM] Leah Shanker: not really angry anymore, he's just gotten very depressed.
[04/27/2008 01:50:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: he has work to do
[04/27/2008 01:50:26 PM] Leah Shanker: he doesn't want to go to any of the classes you have with him or even step foot in 105 anymore.
[04/27/2008 01:50:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: will he be able to get it done?
[04/27/2008 01:50:34 PM] Leah Shanker: he got project extensions.
[04/27/2008 01:51:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: tell him he only have a few days left, he just has to get through it
[04/27/2008 01:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am nervous about seeing him too
[04/27/2008 01:52:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i work something out with him?
[04/27/2008 01:52:59 PM] Leah Shanker: no
[04/27/2008 01:53:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean we only have principles
[04/27/2008 01:53:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can ditch 1 day
[04/27/2008 01:53:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so he can go
[04/27/2008 01:53:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i probably won't spend much time in 105
[04/27/2008 01:53:47 PM] Leah Shanker: actually, that may be pretty optimal for the rest of the semester.
[04/27/2008 01:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[04/27/2008 01:53:56 PM] Leah Shanker: at least he'll have to summer to himself.
[04/27/2008 01:54:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: just let him know i don't want to make anything more difficult
[04/27/2008 01:55:27 PM] Leah Shanker: he also says he has outside friends who don't really hang out with crystal that he can lean on, so I feel good about that.
[04/27/2008 01:56:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I probably am not the best person for him, I just feel like I need to do something to help him out because I feel a tad responsible.
[04/27/2008 01:56:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wasn't you
[04/27/2008 01:56:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we all just need to cool off
[04/27/2008 01:58:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it's really hard right now, but I do think it will work out for the best still.
[04/27/2008 01:58:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve is saying all kinds of things like he was planning his life around her, wanting to marry her etc.
[04/27/2008 01:59:02 PM] Leah Shanker: But from what I heard about their relationshipo
[04/27/2008 01:59:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, steve and i will never be cool
[04/27/2008 01:59:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: crystal told me she didn't expect that to happen any time soon
[04/27/2008 01:59:30 PM] Leah Shanker: it seems like because he lost her, all of these feelings are now coming up.
[04/27/2008 01:59:51 PM] Leah Shanker: I agree, they weren't great together.
[04/27/2008 02:00:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: she also said that she felt sorry for him, but doesn't regret it
[04/27/2008 02:01:48 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry, I'm not trying to make this worse. I know in the end it will work out for the best.
[04/27/2008 02:01:57 PM] Leah Shanker: But I can't help feeling for Steve.
[04/27/2008 02:03:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i totally agree
[04/27/2008 02:06:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: did he read my e-mail?
[04/27/2008 02:06:29 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh, you probably shouldn't contact him.
[04/27/2008 02:06:42 PM] Leah Shanker: he'll have someone to channel his emotion onto.
[04/27/2008 02:08:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: he requested it
[04/27/2008 02:08:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wanted me to send him the convo
[04/27/2008 02:08:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i did
[04/27/2008 02:08:50 PM] Leah Shanker: oh ok

[04/27/2008 02:28:37 PM] Leah Shanker: do you really want to know this?
[04/27/2008 02:28:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think so yes
[04/27/2008 02:29:31 PM] Leah Shanker: karan, for sure. 
[04/27/2008 02:29:57 PM] Leah Shanker: maybe david smith, maybe not. he was closer to crystal than to steve.
[04/27/2008 02:30:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/27/2008 02:30:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about ryan

[04/27/2008 03:39:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: what does matt think?
[04/27/2008 03:40:19 PM] Leah Shanker: he thinks crystal probably did it as a statement that her relationship is final.
[04/27/2008 03:40:27 PM] Leah Shanker: her breakup, i mean.
[04/27/2008 03:40:37 PM] Leah Shanker: since they've broken up and gotten back together a few times
[04/27/2008 03:40:59 PM] Leah Shanker: he thinks crystal resorted to something drastic, and then justified it because he did it to her earlier in the relationship
[04/27/2008 03:41:26 PM] Leah Shanker: he is about equal friends with both of you so he hasn't really taken a side.
[04/27/2008 03:44:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: probably for the best
[04/27/2008 03:44:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[04/27/2008 04:06:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i am just about done with this scheme project

[04/27/2008 04:19:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what exactly did you say?
[04/27/2008 04:20:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: was it really that bad?
[04/27/2008 04:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you seem really concerned with it
[04/27/2008 04:21:24 PM] Leah Shanker: well normally I'm very polite.
[04/27/2008 04:21:32 PM] Leah Shanker: so this seems like something way out of character for me.
[04/27/2008 04:21:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/27/2008 04:21:48 PM] Leah Shanker: but he was being an asshole and he did call me a bitch.
[04/27/2008 04:22:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, omfg, you are the sweetest person i know
[04/27/2008 04:22:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes we just let go

[04/27/2008 04:30:51 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i don't know if I would apologize, though. he really was an asshole.
[04/27/2008 04:30:58 PM] Leah Shanker: eh, maybe you shoudl.
[04/27/2008 04:31:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i didn't plan on it, but i think we should come to some kind of understanding
[04/27/2008 04:31:46 PM] Leah Shanker: if he were to ask nicely, i would have been happy to let the rest of the party know to quiet down.
[04/27/2008 04:32:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally
[04/27/2008 04:34:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so do his functions handle the :- stuff?
[04/27/2008 04:34:27 PM] Leah Shanker: no, we have to do that.
[04/27/2008 04:34:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit
[04/27/2008 04:40:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: that complicated things
[04/27/2008 04:40:37 PM] Leah Shanker: what did?
[04/27/2008 04:40:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: *complicates
[04/27/2008 04:40:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: the :-
[04/27/2008 04:40:50 PM] Leah Shanker: oh, the :-?
[04/27/2008 04:40:54 PM] Leah Shanker: that's the whole assignment.
[04/27/2008 04:40:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i am totally off
[04/27/2008 04:41:00 PM] Leah Shanker: it's really really easy
[04/27/2008 04:41:27 PM] Leah Shanker: it's just a matter of taking in goals, determining if they're unique
[04/27/2008 04:41:33 PM] Leah Shanker: and then adding them to the rule list.
[04/27/2008 04:42:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: can i check for the :- and call his functions on each argument after that?
[04/27/2008 04:43:20 PM] Leah Shanker: no no no
[04/27/2008 04:43:29 PM] Leah Shanker: there isn't actually andy :- anywhere.
[04/27/2008 04:43:31 PM] Leah Shanker: any*
[04/27/2008 04:43:37 PM] Leah Shanker: he gives you a scheme-friendly list.
[04/27/2008 04:43:41 PM] Leah Shanker: there's an implied :-

[04/27/2008 04:44:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/27/2008 04:44:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're silly
[04/27/2008 04:44:25 PM] Leah Shanker: yup, so the :- implies a unify.
[04/27/2008 04:44:38 PM] Leah Shanker: so we have to implement that really hard test question that didn't end up being on the test.
[04/27/2008 04:44:50 PM] Leah Shanker: first you find a variable that you can bind to a clause.
[04/27/2008 04:44:53 PM] Leah Shanker: then you unify that
[04/27/2008 04:45:16 PM] Leah Shanker: and you repeat until it fails or not.
[04/27/2008 04:45:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/27/2008 04:45:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks

[04/27/2008 04:47:11 PM] Leah Shanker: all right, your choice.

[04/27/2008 07:16:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have to write the deep-replace

[04/28/2008 12:15:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: so don't metion crystal and i were hanging out today to anyone
[04/28/2008 12:15:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: we are trying to keep it on the dl
[04/28/2008 12:15:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: (it being... nothing)
[04/28/2008 12:15:47 AM] Leah Shanker: lying and scheming is not the way to build a solid relationship...
[04/28/2008 12:15:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree
[04/28/2008 12:16:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: , and we are not going to lie about anything
[04/28/2008 12:16:07 AM] Leah Shanker: i won't mention it, but i think you should probably kick that habit
[04/28/2008 12:16:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: we just aren't talking about it
[04/28/2008 12:20:02 AM] Leah Shanker: also you know that crystal told steve that she won't be associating with you anymore.
[04/28/2008 12:20:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[04/28/2008 12:20:20 AM] Leah Shanker: maybe it's just me, but i'm really big on honesty.
[04/28/2008 12:20:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah me too
[04/28/2008 12:20:44 AM] Leah Shanker: of course i didn't tell him anything, but seriously you should think about creating a base of honesty.
[04/28/2008 12:20:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just wanted to take it easy for a few days, i am not saying we should hide it, but just not flaunt it
[04/28/2008 12:20:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i guess it is over
[04/28/2008 12:21:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was a good run
[04/28/2008 12:21:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: ... for a measly 2 days.
[04/28/2008 12:21:21 AM] Leah Shanker: you also know that she's leaving in two weeks, right?
[04/28/2008 12:22:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tried to create a base of honesty, i told her i didn't mind we would only have a little time to spend together, and that i don't require any commitment, all i wanted was for her to be honest
[04/28/2008 12:23:32 AM] Leah Shanker: well, on the bright side,
[04/28/2008 12:23:46 AM] Leah Shanker: you can check off being someone's dirty little secret off your purity test :)
[04/28/2008 12:32:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that was a little fun
[04/28/2008 12:32:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: dirty secrets are good to have every now and then
[04/28/2008 12:32:44 AM] Leah Shanker: you would say that you little scorpio

[04/28/2008 11:00:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: *heart*
[04/28/2008 11:00:40 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/28/2008 11:00:49 AM] Leah Shanker: I actually had most of it working
[04/28/2008 11:00:55 AM] Leah Shanker: not all of it, but I turned in something tangible.
[04/28/2008 11:01:04 AM] Leah Shanker: probably would have pulled off a B or C
[04/28/2008 11:01:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: you going to do the revised copy?
[04/28/2008 11:01:12 AM] Leah Shanker: but that's excellent, means I can actually perfect it.
[04/28/2008 11:01:17 AM] Leah Shanker: if I have time, yes.
[04/28/2008 11:01:34 AM] Leah Shanker: how'd you do, did you get it all done?
[04/28/2008 11:02:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i finished it just as you were leaving
[04/28/2008 11:02:38 AM] Leah Shanker: that's good, at least you didn't get to bed too late.
[04/28/2008 11:02:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: no i did
[04/28/2008 11:02:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was talking to steve
[04/28/2008 11:03:01 AM] Leah Shanker: uh oh
[04/28/2008 11:03:06 AM] Leah Shanker: what happened?
[04/28/2008 11:03:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: a lot of interesting shit
[04/28/2008 11:04:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: i believe i either secured my future with crystal, or got them back together, either way i was able to turn the tables and put the responsibility on steve
[04/28/2008 11:04:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: so now if it doesn't work, he won't have anyone else to blame
[04/28/2008 11:05:22 AM] Leah Shanker: eh, there's always someone else to blame.
[04/28/2008 11:05:44 AM] Leah Shanker: but what do you mean? did you give him an ultimatum?
[04/28/2008 11:07:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: he basically said he didn't want me influencing her, so i decided i could handle that, but i assured him i wasn't going to stop being her friend, she decided to spend the next week with focusing on their relationship, and if she decides it isn't going to work, then he is going to call it over
[04/28/2008 11:08:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think steve will let it go for a while
[04/28/2008 11:09:46 AM] Leah Shanker: that's good, that will give crystal a very firm idea of what she wants to do.
[04/28/2008 11:10:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i asked her some questions about how she felt, and she was doubtful she would want to be with him even after a week, i asked her "even if he never takes you back, and even if you have no idea how long a relationship with me would last, would you want to stay in a secure relationship, or try the unexpected" and she was pretty much all for the unexpected, i am paraphrasing of course
[04/28/2008 11:10:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am hopeful
[04/28/2008 11:10:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i can deal with the bachelor life
[04/28/2008 11:11:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: *i don't mind the bachelor life
[04/28/2008 11:13:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: frak, i haven't read slashdot for like 3 days, i am going to start convulsing 
[04/28/2008 11:13:13 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/28/2008 11:13:48 AM] Leah Shanker: are you ok with having an outward short-term relationship with her?
[04/28/2008 11:14:01 AM] Leah Shanker: specifically stating that it will end when she leaves?
[04/28/2008 11:14:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would love to
[04/28/2008 11:16:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i told her that i really enjoying getting to know her, and i didn't need any commitment, but i don't plan on pursuing other girls, so i am here if she wants me
[04/28/2008 11:58:47 AM] Leah Shanker: are you coming to 105?
[04/28/2008 11:58:50 AM] Leah Shanker: when is your next class?
[04/28/2008 11:59:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: 1:50 xml class
[04/28/2008 11:59:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: what is up?

[04/28/2008 11:59:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am at work
[04/28/2008 11:59:58 AM] Leah Shanker: oh ok

[04/28/2008 02:23:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was one thing that bothered me last night that i can't seem to stop thinking about, maybe you can be me voice of reason....
[04/28/2008 02:23:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve was pretty quick to judge my capacity to be in a quality relationship
[04/28/2008 02:24:47 PM] Leah Shanker: yes, he is eager to hate you.
[04/28/2008 02:24:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: with inquisitions like "what could you possibly have to offer her"
[04/28/2008 02:25:14 PM] Leah Shanker: i know, he sent me the conversation.
[04/28/2008 02:25:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like he is looking for reasons to hate me
[04/28/2008 02:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: which isn't really the best way to handle this
[04/28/2008 02:25:55 PM] Leah Shanker: well, it's the most predictable response.
[04/28/2008 02:26:24 PM] Leah Shanker: plus you're a bad boy for mentioning you wouldn't mind having a temporary relationship with her.
[04/28/2008 02:27:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: you think so?
[04/28/2008 02:27:14 PM] Leah Shanker: yes, definitely not something to tell him.
[04/28/2008 02:27:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought that just leaves things open to change, for better or worse.
[04/28/2008 02:27:28 PM] Leah Shanker: that most certainly insinuates fuckbuddy.
[04/28/2008 02:27:33 PM] Leah Shanker: that was his term, not mine.
[04/28/2008 02:27:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha, that would absolutely not be what i want out of this
[04/28/2008 02:28:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i was considering telling her i would like to limit any sexual contact, but just previously she expressed that same feeling
[04/28/2008 02:29:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think it worked out, if we get into a relationship it will be genuine
[04/28/2008 02:29:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho
[04/28/2008 02:29:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is off topic from my query, thanks for the talk

[04/28/2008 02:29:58 PM] Leah Shanker: oh your ability to be in a serious relationship?
[04/28/2008 02:30:27 PM] Leah Shanker: well, he can give you all the argument points.
[04/28/2008 02:30:45 PM] Leah Shanker: i remember the ring finger sizing thing, all that jazz. 
[04/28/2008 02:31:18 PM] Leah Shanker: and you should probably not argue with him. definitely let him win that argument - i.e. don't open the floodgates by commenting on their relationship
[04/28/2008 02:31:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i definitely didn't comment on that
[04/28/2008 02:32:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: but just between you and me, i think he kind of jumped the gun, and crystal expressed being unsure about it to me
[04/28/2008 02:32:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: marraige is a serious thing
[04/28/2008 02:32:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: some women get off to it
[04/28/2008 02:32:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some women are scared to death of it
[04/28/2008 02:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there is a lot of in between
[04/28/2008 02:33:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: but crystal i think leans toward the latter
[04/28/2008 02:33:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he should know this
[04/28/2008 02:33:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i don't consider that a valid argument point because it is one sided
[04/28/2008 02:33:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: just between you and me

[04/28/2008 02:41:01 PM] Leah Shanker: but then, I can't really comment on your ability to be in a long-term relationship since we haven't really talk about relationships.
[04/28/2008 02:41:04 PM] Leah Shanker: talked*
[04/28/2008 02:42:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess you would just have to believe me when i say i am very accommodating to my romantic relationships, since you haven't seen any evidence of it
[04/28/2008 02:42:58 PM] Leah Shanker: I can't disagree with you
[04/28/2008 02:43:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i hope i do get into a relationship, we can double date!
[04/28/2008 02:44:16 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh hooray
[04/28/2008 02:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i do tone down the cynicism, so i am sure you would appreciate that
[04/28/2008 02:45:49 PM] Leah Shanker: Yay :)
[04/28/2008 03:14:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mean to be a pest, because i know you have a lot of more important work to do, but off the top of your head did anything else stand out where i was out of line in the conversation he sent you?
[04/28/2008 03:15:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to answer now if you are busy, but as you know by now i am trying hard to not be that typical asshole guy
[04/28/2008 03:15:42 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, i'll go over it with you tonight when I get a chance
[04/28/2008 03:15:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i do appreciate your advice
[04/28/2008 03:15:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good
[04/28/2008 03:15:56 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, that sounded like a business proposition
[04/28/2008 03:16:19 PM] Leah Shanker: sorry, i'll talk to you tonight.
[04/28/2008 03:16:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha, well if it was i probably wouldn't be a very good manager
[04/28/2008 03:16:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: k talk to you then

[04/28/2008 05:41:40 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, a couple things
[04/28/2008 05:41:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/28/2008 05:42:02 PM] Leah Shanker: this is most certainly not for steve to know.
[04/28/2008 05:42:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/28/2008 05:43:17 PM] Leah Shanker: One of the most attractive things I see in Matt is this lack of authoritarian "I-can-provide-for-her" attitudes.
[04/28/2008 05:43:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[04/28/2008 05:44:21 PM] Leah Shanker: Although that seems to be very prevalent in males in general, I think it can lead to tricky situations when the woman is in a situation she most certainly didn't ask for.
[04/28/2008 05:44:45 PM] Leah Shanker: That's definitely one of the things I also see from your conversation with Steve that you don't have
[04/28/2008 05:44:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yesm, i certainly can get complicated
[04/28/2008 05:44:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: *it
[04/28/2008 05:45:43 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm not sure if Crystal is looking for a long-term relationship or not, really.
[04/28/2008 05:45:55 PM] Leah Shanker: But that is definitely an example of what makes a lasting relationship.
[04/28/2008 05:46:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is generally my outlook on relationships, i only want it to be known that all [she] has to do is ask
[04/28/2008 05:46:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Possessiveness, and I know this from personal experience, ruins trust.
[04/28/2008 05:46:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[04/28/2008 05:47:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know, maybe that is what she needs to keep going, i really don't know, she didn't express that to me so i was a little surprised at it, but i tried to leave it alone best i could
[04/28/2008 05:47:34 PM] Leah Shanker: although steve really is freaking out right now, throwing out the idea of marriage in fear to get Crystal back.
[04/28/2008 05:47:46 PM] Leah Shanker: In fact, he's going all out in fear and anger to try and get her back
[04/28/2008 05:47:54 PM] Leah Shanker: without really considering her feelings on the matter.
[04/28/2008 05:47:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i took what you said about commenting on their relationship into consideration and i think that helped steve find the tolerance to talk to me
[04/28/2008 05:48:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, I think it's a guy-boundary you're not supposed to cross
[04/28/2008 05:48:33 PM] Leah Shanker: unless it's a best friend or something.
[04/28/2008 05:48:56 PM] Leah Shanker: Even if someone's girlfriend tells you everything that's wrong with their relationship
[04/28/2008 05:49:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am however glad to hear he is taking affirmative action against me, i think it is really defining in a relationship
[04/28/2008 05:49:27 PM] Leah Shanker: what do you mean?
[04/28/2008 05:50:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just mean if he is giving it his all to try and get her back, that shows devotion, and they will both be able to decide together if it is right
[04/28/2008 05:50:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess the blame will be lifted off me a little more
[04/28/2008 05:50:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe
[04/28/2008 05:51:34 PM] Leah Shanker: I think I agree with you in general, but there is a point at which I let go.
[04/28/2008 05:52:07 PM] Leah Shanker: I think if Matt were to cheat on me, even after everything we've been through together, I don't think I could forgive him.
[04/28/2008 05:52:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve is remarkably forgiving.
[04/28/2008 05:52:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes that is certainly true, letting go is sometimes the best thing to do
[04/28/2008 05:53:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't blame him for putting up a fight, just because of how fast everything has happened
[04/28/2008 05:53:32 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah
[04/28/2008 05:53:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is forgiving, but he was with another person last December when she forgave him
[04/28/2008 05:54:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Perhaps that is how she justified what she did.
[04/28/2008 05:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what is so disappointing to me about all this, it is too obsessive, all this you cheat i cheat bullshit is unhealthy for a person soul, not just their heart
[04/28/2008 05:55:07 PM] Leah Shanker: I completely agree.
[04/28/2008 05:55:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think she is trying to justify it, because i don't think she feels she has to, it is what it is
[04/28/2008 05:56:10 PM] Leah Shanker: And to a large extent, I agree with her. However, the relationship probably should have ended when she realized she could never forgive him.
[04/28/2008 05:57:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see you point, but i am not sure she holds it against him, maybe at this point it is being used as an excuse, but i really don't know
[04/28/2008 05:57:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think she is intelligent and attractive so obviously i am going to have a skewed perspective of her actions
[04/28/2008 05:58:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think cheating it right
[04/28/2008 05:58:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if i was in a relationship with her, i would tell her i want to know if it happens, and i would certainly consider pursuing other options if she did it to me
[04/28/2008 05:59:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: (other options) being seeing someone else, or not seeing each other for a while, until she works out her priorities
[04/28/2008 05:59:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but this is all hypothetical of course
[04/28/2008 06:00:42 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it would be a complete deal-breaker for me.
[04/28/2008 06:01:33 PM] Leah Shanker: Because I believe that cheating is a symptom of a deep-rooted, greater problem with insecurity and a complete disrespect of an established relationship.
[04/28/2008 06:01:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have never been a big fan of the "get back together" concept, but that is how i would play it off
[04/28/2008 06:01:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i totally agree
[04/28/2008 06:03:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Then, I've never been cheated on that I know about.
[04/28/2008 06:03:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's good
[04/28/2008 06:03:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: Dave does scare me though
[04/28/2008 06:03:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve not so much
[04/28/2008 06:03:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but my roommate
[04/28/2008 06:03:45 PM] Leah Shanker: what do you mean?
[04/28/2008 06:04:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is not so much him being disappointed in my actions, because he is definitely good at acting all high and mighty
[04/28/2008 06:04:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i've known him for years, and there was one instance when i saw the fury in his eyes
[04/28/2008 06:04:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it did scare the fuck out of me
[04/28/2008 06:05:18 PM] Leah Shanker: is he really angry with you now?
[04/28/2008 06:05:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just bring it up because Dave is good friends with steve
[04/28/2008 06:06:16 PM] Leah Shanker: he seemed ok when you were here in 105.
[04/28/2008 06:06:32 PM] Leah Shanker: he's done similar stupid sexual things as I remember.
[04/28/2008 06:07:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think so.
[04/28/2008 06:07:48 PM] Leah Shanker: plus i'm not sure dave would start something with you and put his place at risk, really.
[04/28/2008 06:08:01 PM] Leah Shanker: that seems like a limiting factor.
[04/28/2008 06:08:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah probably not, but i would aviode fighting with steve more because of dave,
[04/28/2008 06:09:30 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't think you have much to worry about.
[04/28/2008 06:09:46 PM] Leah Shanker: It would be highly out of character and irrational of him.
[04/28/2008 06:10:48 PM] Leah Shanker: He'll probably prod you about it, maybe even stop giving you tests or something else pretty mild, if he cares enough to.
[04/28/2008 06:11:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/28/2008 06:12:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not afraid he is going to fight with me or anything
[04/28/2008 06:12:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is just, you have never seen him angry
[04/28/2008 06:12:52 PM] Leah Shanker: no, but if you seem that scared by it, it would probably scare me more.
[04/28/2008 06:13:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho, i think crystal resolved to give it another shot with steve
[04/28/2008 06:14:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess we will see how long this one lasts
[04/28/2008 06:16:08 PM] Leah Shanker: sorry to hear that, but if it makes you feel any better, it may have saved you a lot of heartache. in a very cop-like fashion, cheaters tend to cheat again...
[04/28/2008 06:16:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: true
[04/28/2008 06:18:44 PM] Leah Shanker: man, you're getting me all pissed off and i've nothing to be pissed about.
[04/28/2008 06:18:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: stop it!
[04/28/2008 06:18:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: everythings totally chill
[04/28/2008 06:19:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you at ACM?
[04/28/2008 06:19:13 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, about to leave though, soon as matt gets here
[04/28/2008 06:19:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless, i bring over the chearleader wine
[04/28/2008 06:19:35 PM] Leah Shanker: lol

[04/28/2008 06:19:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: totally
[04/28/2008 06:20:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: no one has to know
[04/28/2008 06:20:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: we can play it off like sparkling cider
[04/28/2008 06:20:24 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/28/2008 06:20:42 PM] Leah Shanker: i really can't though, i have to make an appearance at lauren's birthday party.
[04/28/2008 06:20:52 PM] Leah Shanker: but after you could probably convince me
[04/28/2008 06:21:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright, let me know where you are, i'll come over too if you just want to chill and watch a show
[04/28/2008 06:21:46 PM] Leah Shanker: yay freaks n geeks!

[04/28/2008 06:23:01 PM] Leah Shanker: not even sure if that's physically possible.
[04/28/2008 06:23:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol no i don't think it is
[04/28/2008 06:23:40 PM] Leah Shanker: hm. well a great dripping chunk then.
[04/28/2008 06:23:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally, i like that show so far

[04/28/2008 11:00:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though she decided to give her and steve another chance, but never cried over him
[04/28/2008 11:01:05 PM] Leah Shanker: perhaps i'm an emotional pessimist
[04/28/2008 11:01:25 PM] Leah Shanker: but for me, it's the cliché actions speak louder than words.
[04/28/2008 11:01:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: LOL

[04/29/2008 01:34:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: i may haz been too honest just now
[04/29/2008 01:37:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i described what i feel about love
[04/29/2008 01:50:17 AM] Leah Shanker: to who?
[04/29/2008 01:50:27 AM] Leah Shanker: (sorry, i had to finish up OS project)
[04/29/2008 02:01:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: crystal
[04/29/2008 02:03:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i kind of described a scene that would be like the ultimate display of love
[04/29/2008 02:05:07 AM] Leah Shanker: eh, you don't need me to tell you that you're being naughty.
[04/29/2008 02:05:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: LOL
[04/29/2008 02:05:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: nah, it was cool
[04/29/2008 02:06:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: i could tell you just for evidence on my scorpioness

[04/29/2008 02:07:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will let it play
[04/29/2008 02:08:04 AM] Leah Shanker: ok
[04/29/2008 02:12:18 AM] Leah Shanker: did you finish the os project?

[04/29/2008 02:13:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i have it except the //if root node part
[04/29/2008 02:13:56 AM] Leah Shanker: i had trouble with that too
[04/29/2008 02:14:11 AM] Leah Shanker: basically when I got into the while loop
[04/29/2008 02:14:42 AM] Leah Shanker: after the current inode matches the stored one
[04/29/2008 02:14:53 AM] Leah Shanker: I called stat again, but this time with
[04/29/2008 02:14:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/29/2008 02:15:04 AM] Leah Shanker: stat("..", &parbuf);
[04/29/2008 02:15:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: ah makes sense
[04/29/2008 02:15:16 AM] Leah Shanker: and then checked my curbuf inode against my parbuf inode
[04/29/2008 02:15:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally
[04/29/2008 02:15:29 AM] Leah Shanker: and then just returned if it was true
[04/29/2008 02:15:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[04/29/2008 02:15:38 AM] Leah Shanker: yup
[04/29/2008 02:15:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: that really helps
[04/29/2008 02:15:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i got everything else
[04/29/2008 02:15:50 AM] Leah Shanker: yaaay
[04/29/2008 02:16:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: since you shared with me
[04/29/2008 02:16:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you like rain?
[04/29/2008 02:16:20 AM] Leah Shanker: only if it's chocolate
[04/29/2008 02:16:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/29/2008 02:16:36 AM] Leah Shanker: no, but i do. only when it's pouring though.
[04/29/2008 02:16:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that is what i mean
[04/29/2008 02:16:51 AM] Leah Shanker: sprinkling rain is annoying, but pouring rain is cleansing.
[04/29/2008 02:16:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: when you can here it on the ceiling
[04/29/2008 02:17:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: and when you thunder is light, and it flashes through the curtains to light up all the little naughty things you do
[04/29/2008 02:17:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: *the thunder
[04/29/2008 02:18:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love that kind of rain
[04/29/2008 02:18:22 AM] Leah Shanker: is that the scene you described to her?
[04/29/2008 02:18:30 AM] Leah Shanker: you are very naughty.
[04/29/2008 02:18:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: not quite
[04/29/2008 02:18:40 AM] Leah Shanker: you're going to get yourself into trouble :)
[04/29/2008 02:18:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: it wasn't that!
[04/29/2008 02:18:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: everyone loves that rain
[04/29/2008 02:19:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the rain is not important
[04/29/2008 02:19:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: the rain is
[04/29/2008 02:19:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: so my perfect image of love is kind of obscure
[04/29/2008 02:21:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it is when a woman (or a man with flowers in your case), is waiting on your door step
[04/29/2008 02:21:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: waiting for you to invite them inside, that is the practical thing to do, but you want to join them in the rain and get wet, that is the raging passion
[04/29/2008 02:22:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the love is when you look at them and sigh, it is a happy sigh, like they are there wanting to be with you, and just waiting for you to embrace them
[04/29/2008 02:24:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: is that weird?
[04/29/2008 02:24:37 AM] Leah Shanker: not in the least
[04/29/2008 02:24:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: is it hot?
[04/29/2008 02:25:00 AM] Leah Shanker: definitely
[04/29/2008 02:25:24 AM] Leah Shanker: i think one of my favorite sex scenes was actually from BSG.
[04/29/2008 02:25:52 AM] Leah Shanker: There was a scene on caprica with starbuck and paint
[04/29/2008 02:26:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i knew you were going to say that
[04/29/2008 02:26:43 AM] Leah Shanker: It's somewhat similar to rain, only the mess is actually part of the fun.
[04/29/2008 02:26:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't pick out the exact scene but i know what you are talking about
[04/29/2008 02:28:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: you are totally right, i am bad
[04/29/2008 02:29:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i can't help it
[04/29/2008 02:29:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: i wasn't breast fed as a child
[04/29/2008 02:29:12 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[04/29/2008 02:32:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: watchya guys talking aboot?
[04/29/2008 02:33:07 AM] Leah Shanker: sex scenes.
[04/29/2008 02:33:11 AM] Leah Shanker: just kidding.
[04/29/2008 02:33:30 AM] Leah Shanker: we're talking about what's on her mind.
[04/29/2008 02:33:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: good stuff
[04/29/2008 02:34:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol "very dirty hot sweaty sex"
[04/29/2008 02:34:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: "you know whats better then sex?"
[04/29/2008 02:34:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: anticipation
[04/29/2008 02:34:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i love grey's anatomy
[04/29/2008 02:35:01 AM] Leah Shanker: i've never watched the show, but it's on all my friends' favorites lists. perhaps i should give it a shot sometime.
[04/29/2008 02:35:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: my love life is like a match, when you first strike it it explodes with fire, but it eventually burns you and dies
[04/29/2008 02:35:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/29/2008 02:38:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: that last part was 100% me
[04/29/2008 02:38:58 AM] Leah Shanker: that's pretty sincere, actually. i'm not sure it's true for the majority of your love life, though.
[04/29/2008 02:39:07 AM] Leah Shanker: at least i hope not
[04/29/2008 02:39:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: not all of it
[04/29/2008 02:39:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: some parts were those long matches you use for fire pits
[04/29/2008 02:42:36 AM] Leah Shanker: my aren't we the optimist?
[04/29/2008 02:42:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/29/2008 02:43:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am an optimistic pessimist
[04/29/2008 02:44:03 AM] Leah Shanker: interesting choice of words.
[04/29/2008 02:44:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i try to find the best of the bad
[04/29/2008 02:44:17 AM] Leah Shanker: you chose optimist as the adjective and pessimist as the noun.

[04/29/2008 01:02:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: crystall wants to block me
[04/29/2008 01:02:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-(
[04/29/2008 01:02:16 PM] Leah Shanker: I was talking to her last night
[04/29/2008 01:02:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so she can determine if she would miss talking to me
[04/29/2008 01:02:28 PM] Leah Shanker: it really got me thinking about what I would do in her situation
[04/29/2008 01:02:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: what would you do?
[04/29/2008 01:03:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Eh, it doesn't matter what I'd do - the advice I gave her
[04/29/2008 01:03:31 PM] Leah Shanker: was to completely disregard your advances and Steve's pleading and really sit down and ask herself what makes her happy.
[04/29/2008 01:04:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i think she has been trying to but not really following through with it
[04/29/2008 01:04:39 PM] Leah Shanker: and, she's very like me in a way.
[04/29/2008 01:04:54 PM] Leah Shanker: when she's faced with a really tough decision to make and lots of schoolwork to do
[04/29/2008 01:05:02 PM] Leah Shanker: it's so much easier to just bury your head in the books.
[04/29/2008 01:05:24 PM] Leah Shanker: and in her case, that means she'll be gone in two weeks and won't really have to ever deal with it.
[04/29/2008 01:07:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: she will deal with it if she doesn't end up wanting to stay with steve, and if she does, then there is no telling whether or not her feelings towards him will change
[04/29/2008 01:08:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is likely she wants to stay with him, which means he will want to stay with her other the summer and while she is in NY
[04/29/2008 01:08:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i doubt they will be able to handle the distance
[04/29/2008 01:08:37 PM] Leah Shanker: something tells me she's already made up her mind about steve.
[04/29/2008 01:08:53 PM] Leah Shanker: but that doesn't really say that she'll want a relationship with you either.
[04/29/2008 01:09:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i don't expect so
[04/29/2008 01:09:13 PM] Leah Shanker: she's going along with steve's plan because it's easier.
[04/29/2008 01:09:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't know, i think there is a pretty good chance she will want to stay with steve, just because it is safe, just to have someone, just like before
[04/29/2008 01:10:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: years will go by, and they will make it through a lot, maybe even get married like steve wanted to before
[04/29/2008 01:10:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it will be normal
[04/29/2008 01:10:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: or plain
[04/29/2008 01:10:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess it is good
[04/29/2008 01:11:26 PM] Leah Shanker: maybe, i don't know.

[04/29/2008 07:12:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i will head over

[04/29/2008 07:13:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i bring wine?
[04/29/2008 07:13:16 PM] Leah Shanker: also bought a new tea maker & a new coffee maker
[04/29/2008 07:13:33 PM] Leah Shanker: since the old one was like really old and uncleanable
[04/29/2008 07:13:53 PM] Leah Shanker: actually, i was surprised by how remarkably well i worked on a glass of disaronno
[04/29/2008 07:14:44 PM] Leah Shanker: you could bring it - the whole bottle will probably have leftovers

[04/29/2008 09:47:12 PM] Leah Shanker: you should not be asking loaded questions like that.
[04/29/2008 09:47:17 PM] Leah Shanker: you are a bad bad boy.
[04/29/2008 09:47:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol

[04/29/2008 09:48:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get it

[04/29/2008 09:48:51 PM] Leah Shanker: you are leading her on.
[04/29/2008 09:48:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[04/29/2008 09:49:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's leading herself on
[04/29/2008 09:49:02 PM] Leah Shanker: or asking her to forget about the current situation.
[04/29/2008 09:49:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/29/2008 09:49:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine
[04/29/2008 09:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll behave

[04/29/2008 09:49:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[04/29/2008 09:56:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but in my defense, i have no other defense, she is with steve, so i have to be inquisitive to keep her interest at all
[04/29/2008 09:56:57 PM] Leah Shanker: now you sound as bad as steve
[04/29/2008 09:57:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: how so?  i am not possessive or obsessed

[04/29/2008 09:58:45 PM] Leah Shanker: perhaps you should let the situation cool off a bit
[04/29/2008 09:58:48 PM] Leah Shanker: without making it worse
[04/29/2008 09:59:11 PM] Leah Shanker: the ball is now in crystal's court.

[04/29/2008 10:00:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, i totally agree, i haven't asked anything else of that nature, only harmless friendly talk, so i will avoid further questions like that.

[04/30/2008 04:06:55 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah people are normally surprised.
[04/30/2008 04:08:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is really helpful, i take my past relationships into considerations, and realize that patience is ever so important
[04/30/2008 04:08:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways, her response was totally lame...
[04/30/2008 04:10:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like she doesn't try to relate to people, enough to want to talk about it
[04/30/2008 04:15:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: does that make sense?
[04/30/2008 04:16:02 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah
[04/30/2008 04:16:19 PM] Leah Shanker: it's very difficult for me to open up to someone, ever, really.
[04/30/2008 04:16:35 PM] Leah Shanker: and so I went out on a limb with her because it seemed like she really needed it.
[04/30/2008 04:17:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, well, i appreciate, seems like her response was a little fake, but maybe that is just her personality
[04/30/2008 04:17:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe she is even more closed then you are, and doesn't know how to respond

[05/02/2008 03:05:52 AM] Leah Shanker: how come?
[05/02/2008 03:06:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't want to be that guy that jumps right into a relationship after she just broke up with her boyfriend because of me
[05/02/2008 03:06:46 AM] Leah Shanker: it doesn't always turn out for the worst
[05/02/2008 03:06:55 AM] Leah Shanker: in fact, matt was that guy for me.
[05/02/2008 03:06:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: a similar thing happened to me, and now i am making that mistake
[05/02/2008 03:07:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: did matt cause you guys to break up?
[05/02/2008 03:07:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: and your guys relationship is ideal.  it is so cool how he sits across the room from you, you guys don't always have to be touching, i am not a big fan of the pda
[05/02/2008 03:08:23 AM] Leah Shanker: yes, he did.
[05/02/2008 03:08:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: but there is still some pda, it is like perfect
[05/02/2008 03:08:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: does someone always have to get hurt in order for things to get better?
[05/02/2008 03:09:33 AM] Leah Shanker: i know it feels like it now
[05/02/2008 03:10:02 AM] Leah Shanker: but had the situation happened differently, and crystal broke it off with steve before seriously pursuing you...
[05/02/2008 03:10:43 AM] Leah Shanker: Listen, I'm only kidding with you when I call you a homewrecker, you know.
[05/02/2008 03:10:52 AM] Leah Shanker: I really hope you know that. I thought I could joke about that.
[05/02/2008 03:11:08 AM] Leah Shanker: Steve and Crystal were inevitably going to break up eventually.
[05/02/2008 03:11:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: nah it's ok, i totally forgot
[05/02/2008 03:11:45 AM] Leah Shanker: It didn't work out cleanly because the situation sort of didn't happen cleanly.
[05/02/2008 03:12:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i am just afraid it is just an infatuation, so i am afraid to be vulnerable around her, she tells me it is a lot more then that, and steve tells me that is all it is
[05/02/2008 03:12:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i wonder if he is trying to play us off each other
[05/02/2008 03:13:10 AM] Leah Shanker: of course he is, he is scared of losing her.
[05/02/2008 03:13:30 AM] Leah Shanker: but not because they were great for each other, but because he's getting something taken away from him.
[05/02/2008 03:13:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i think he made a mistake asking her not to talk to me or see me, because as a result she is just going to spend the week thinking about me, at least if she were talking to me she could get out of her head.
[05/02/2008 03:13:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know because i spent the week thinking about her
[05/02/2008 03:14:32 AM] Leah Shanker: everything is an infatuation until you let yourself be vulnerable.
[05/02/2008 03:15:11 AM] Leah Shanker: I don't think "just an infatuation" really exists.
[05/02/2008 03:15:23 AM] Leah Shanker: Either you see it through to the end or not.
[05/02/2008 03:15:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/02/2008 03:16:11 AM] Leah Shanker: How come you're worried about being with her?
[05/02/2008 03:16:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: steve said i am a replacement
[05/02/2008 03:16:31 AM] Leah Shanker: this is why I don't think you should talk to steve...
[05/02/2008 03:17:02 AM] Leah Shanker: of course steve isn't going to give you an honest viewpoint.
[05/02/2008 03:17:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: but he gave me some examples of things she does that she used to do around him, and i find it amusing because i think i really understand why she does those things, not just what she does
[05/02/2008 03:17:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he does too
[05/02/2008 03:17:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but he didn't express that
[05/02/2008 03:19:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: don't you think it will be awkward if we turn out having this great relationship, and we spend lots of time together?
[05/02/2008 03:19:19 AM] Leah Shanker: who, you and crystal?
[05/02/2008 03:19:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/02/2008 03:19:37 AM] Leah Shanker: hm, well, she is leaving in two weeks.
[05/02/2008 03:19:55 AM] Leah Shanker: well, a few days now.
[05/02/2008 03:20:18 AM] Leah Shanker: so i don't think you'll ever run into the situation where you're together around steve...
[05/02/2008 03:20:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but life seems like eternity at this age, i may see her again...
[05/02/2008 03:21:56 AM] Leah Shanker: I really think what steve is trying to do is making it very hard for you to establish a relationship before she leaves.
[05/02/2008 03:22:29 AM] Leah Shanker: so you will be faced with the very tough choice
[05/02/2008 03:22:52 AM] Leah Shanker: do you pursue beautiful, smart Crystal even if it means a long distance relationship?
[05/02/2008 03:23:12 AM] Leah Shanker: without a pre-established relationship, no less.
[05/02/2008 03:25:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: i try to keep things simple, i certainly enjoy having a girlfriend, but i do not rely on it.  i am also easily amused when it comes to women, and i can wait for the physical...
[05/02/2008 03:26:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is probably my best year, and there was no girlfriend
[05/02/2008 03:26:53 AM] Leah Shanker: why do you say that?
[05/02/2008 03:27:02 AM] Leah Shanker: your best year, i mean
[05/02/2008 03:27:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i accomplished a lot, and it felt good, i am pretty dedicated to my work, so i guess that will entertain me if i have to wait
[05/02/2008 03:29:09 AM] Leah Shanker: that's a very good outlook you've got.
[05/02/2008 03:29:28 AM] Leah Shanker: much stronger than I am - I haven't been without a partner since I was 14.
[05/02/2008 03:30:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: the sex is the hardest part
[05/02/2008 03:30:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg, sex is amazing
[05/02/2008 03:30:40 AM] Leah Shanker: this is very true
[05/02/2008 03:30:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: omg i haz whiskey
[05/02/2008 03:30:56 AM] Leah Shanker: but it's not really the defining characteristic in a good relationship, i dont think
[05/02/2008 03:31:15 AM] Leah Shanker: great sex is usually an indication of a great relationship, imho
[05/02/2008 03:31:50 AM] Leah Shanker: anyway, i'm heading home
[05/02/2008 03:31:55 AM] Leah Shanker: night night

[05/02/2008 12:53:50 PM] Leah Shanker: he asked me whether I thought you would be good to crystal or not
[05/02/2008 12:54:32 PM] Leah Shanker: and i told him for sure you weren't just looking for a fuckbuddy, like he first supposed, in fact you talk about how amazingly smart, funny and beautiful Crystal is constantly, and that you would treat her right.
[05/02/2008 12:54:59 PM] Leah Shanker: I think that really got him to start seeing you in a different sort of light
[05/02/2008 01:00:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, this is effing weird

[05/04/2008 04:51:28 PM] Leah Shanker: So for example
[05/04/2008 04:51:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt & I spend $200 on groceries every two weeks

[05/04/2008 04:57:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean if we did it for like 2k and split it
[05/04/2008 04:58:04 PM] Leah Shanker: from your parents?
[05/04/2008 04:58:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, i mean we have to make david chana an offer
[05/04/2008 04:58:29 PM] Leah Shanker: oh ok
[05/04/2008 04:58:35 PM] Leah Shanker: didn't catch the subject change.
[05/04/2008 04:58:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i started off as that
[05/04/2008 04:58:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: [05/04/2008 02:44:53 PM] Leah Shanker: did you get that e-mail from that website guy?
 [05/04/2008 03:20:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
 [05/04/2008 03:40:39 PM] Leah Shanker: so I think he would obviously rather go with us because we're cheaper
 [05/04/2008 04:39:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am thinking about just asking for 1200 because i can live two months off of that and work on it
 
[05/04/2008 04:58:56 PM] Leah Shanker: 1200 is excellent.
[05/04/2008 04:59:25 PM] Leah Shanker: It's cheap enough for them to consider us.
[05/04/2008 04:59:34 PM] Leah Shanker: And we really are awesome web developers.
[05/04/2008 04:59:56 PM] Leah Shanker: oh but you know
[05/04/2008 05:00:04 PM] Leah Shanker: since we both aren't really totally excited aout this
[05/04/2008 05:00:11 PM] Leah Shanker: we could just offer them something ridiculous
[05/04/2008 05:00:16 PM] Leah Shanker: and if they take it, then awesome.
[05/04/2008 05:00:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats why i think we should make a higher offer
[05/04/2008 05:00:23 PM] Leah Shanker: otherwise, we have time over the summer
[05/04/2008 05:00:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: to make it worth it for us too
[05/04/2008 05:00:49 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah. make sure you push that we aren't just students. we both have worked professionally as web developers.
[05/04/2008 05:00:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/04/2008 05:01:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright i'll start going back and forth with them, would monthly pay we alright with you?
[05/04/2008 05:02:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i figure if we take the main cuts and don't feel like working on it all the time, we can find some other people to fill in for us for a little bit
[05/04/2008 05:02:17 PM] Leah Shanker: oooh delegation.
[05/04/2008 05:02:55 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, and if we can get a sweet deal from them, then we can pay someone $7/hr or something to work on it.
[05/04/2008 05:03:23 PM] Leah Shanker: but that should be our last resort. I'm kind of greedy and untrusting on that front.
[05/04/2008 05:03:43 PM] Leah Shanker: So start with something like $2500 or so
[05/04/2008 05:03:48 PM] Leah Shanker: over the course of the summer
[05/04/2008 05:03:51 PM] Leah Shanker: and work down from there
[05/04/2008 05:04:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/04/2008 05:04:09 PM] Leah Shanker: but definitely press that both of us are very highly qualified.
[05/04/2008 05:04:15 PM] Leah Shanker: not just code monkeys.
[05/04/2008 05:04:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: totally
[05/04/2008 05:05:36 PM] Leah Shanker: and also press that we can work on the most important aspects of the website first.
[05/04/2008 05:06:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is a little stuffy in here
[05/04/2008 05:06:54 PM] Leah Shanker: it always is - it's all the computers.
[05/04/2008 05:07:37 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok
[05/04/2008 05:07:40 PM] Leah Shanker: also in your e-mail
[05/04/2008 05:07:47 PM] Leah Shanker: You can say things like
[05/04/2008 05:08:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Should you have approached us sometime before reading week (all of us have pretty much worked out our summer plans), we could have offered you more of our time.
[05/04/2008 05:09:13 PM] Leah Shanker: From what I got from the meeting
[05/04/2008 05:09:43 PM] Leah Shanker: He's looking for a professional web solution in exchange for one banner ad for ACM.
[05/04/2008 05:09:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Which doesn't really need advertising.
[05/04/2008 05:10:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally
[05/04/2008 05:10:11 PM] Leah Shanker: And I am not willing to work solely for that.
[05/04/2008 05:10:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it also sounded like he was willing to pay
[05/04/2008 05:10:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, true.
[05/04/2008 05:11:43 PM] Leah Shanker: But then again
[05/04/2008 05:11:43 PM] Leah Shanker: neither of us REALLY want to do this.
[05/04/2008 05:11:48 PM] Leah Shanker: So let's make an unreasonable offer
[05/04/2008 05:11:51 PM] Leah Shanker: and see if they bite.
[05/04/2008 05:17:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: ew, is it totally gross to buy someone's stuff after they pass away
[05/04/2008 05:17:56 PM] Leah Shanker: no, it helps out the family.
[05/04/2008 05:18:09 PM] Leah Shanker: though i am a little bit more sentimental also
[05/04/2008 05:18:25 PM] Leah Shanker: like, if matt were to buy my wedding ring from an estate sale or something
[05/04/2008 05:18:42 PM] Leah Shanker: I would be wondering my whole life whether their marriage was terrible or she was killed by him or something.
[05/04/2008 05:18:55 PM] Leah Shanker: so with tokens of love, i think it's gross.
[05/04/2008 05:19:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, totally
[05/04/2008 05:19:13 PM] Leah Shanker: but other things, like houses, cars, etc.
[05/04/2008 05:19:15 PM] Leah Shanker: no biggie.
[05/04/2008 05:20:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: has steve spoken to her?
[05/04/2008 05:21:05 PM] Leah Shanker: he wrote her an e-mail I think
[05/04/2008 05:21:10 PM] Leah Shanker: but not spoken.
[05/04/2008 05:21:40 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't really blame him - best thing for him to think about right now is himself.
[05/04/2008 05:21:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: totally agree
[05/04/2008 05:23:09 PM] Leah Shanker: I felt really awkward with Austin here last night
[05/04/2008 05:23:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: more awkward then now?
[05/04/2008 05:23:28 PM] Leah Shanker: no
[05/04/2008 05:23:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: *than
[05/04/2008 05:23:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/04/2008 05:23:42 PM] Leah Shanker: but she really seemed like she was on the brink of crying
[05/04/2008 05:23:54 PM] Leah Shanker: so I don't really know how much David told her or even remembers.
[05/04/2008 05:23:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[05/04/2008 05:24:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: very odd
[05/04/2008 05:24:08 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, she was trying to hide it, but I know her.
[05/04/2008 05:24:53 PM] Leah Shanker: and it was awful that she was here while mike was drawing it.
[05/04/2008 05:25:34 PM] Leah Shanker: but, he is kind of a player.
[05/04/2008 05:25:47 PM] Leah Shanker: i felt weird about them going out to begin with.
[05/04/2008 05:26:02 PM] Leah Shanker: austin is a very straight-edge kind of girl.
[05/04/2008 05:28:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think they both agreed to not see each other after she graduates.  maybe he just expressed that to her, so it was kind of over but not quite.
[05/04/2008 05:28:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: crystal and i agreed to see how it plays out with the long distance
[05/04/2008 05:29:23 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, long distance is kind of like sex, in that it can either make or break your relationship.
[05/04/2008 05:30:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah we definitely covered a lot of physical ground last night
[05/04/2008 05:30:51 PM] Leah Shanker: that's not what I'm saying :)
[05/04/2008 05:31:08 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm saying it's a test of your current relationship.
[05/04/2008 05:32:07 PM] Leah Shanker: so, make it as great as possible until she leaves
[05/04/2008 05:32:11 PM] Leah Shanker: otherwise, it's definitely over.
[05/04/2008 05:41:36 PM] Leah Shanker: i think i left my iphone cord at your house
[05/04/2008 05:42:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is possible, i haven't seen it, but my place is still a mess
[05/04/2008 05:42:22 PM] Leah Shanker: if its there, it should be near your projector
[05/04/2008 05:57:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg finally got my mail server working
[05/04/2008 05:57:23 PM] Leah Shanker: nice
[05/04/2008 06:01:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to test it with a website that for sure sends out a verification e-mail
[05/04/2008 06:10:26 PM] Leah Shanker: are you going again to see iron man?
[05/04/2008 06:10:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: just waiting on you

[05/04/2008 06:11:10 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah its got to wait
[05/04/2008 06:11:15 PM] Leah Shanker: no way he can take off time now

[05/05/2008 08:47:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, it wasn't squeaky clean.
[05/05/2008 08:48:11 PM] Leah Shanker: Listen, I'm on your side. I think Crystal is much happier now that she's with you.
[05/05/2008 08:48:21 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm just saying, he also has a point.
[05/05/2008 08:48:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm, i suppose, i guess i just didn't really think about it because both sides were consenting
[05/05/2008 08:49:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is why i try to prevent things like this, my parties just get out of hand sometimes
[05/05/2008 08:51:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, orgies = not my scene.
[05/05/2008 08:51:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are hard to please, we had games last week and you guys still took off
[05/05/2008 08:53:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, to be honest, we (Matt & I at least) have kind of outgrown the whole drinking for fun sort of party setup.
[05/05/2008 08:54:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have to do another dinner party some time
[05/05/2008 08:54:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we can drink for the sake of dinner
[05/05/2008 08:54:55 PM] Leah Shanker: You don't have to formulate your parties around us.

[05/06/2008 03:34:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Although I don't really want him to be there, I also think he has some leverage now.
[05/06/2008 03:35:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Now that he knows we were drinking wine in 105, I am less likely to try and push him.
[05/06/2008 03:36:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, true
[05/06/2008 03:36:17 PM] Leah Shanker: I've heard from people who have had previous experiences with him that he tends to be a sniveling clype.

[05/06/2008 03:36:54 PM] Leah Shanker: ?

[05/06/2008 03:37:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is a douche bag
[05/06/2008 03:37:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should probably all just tollerate him until the end of the semester
[05/06/2008 03:37:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think he is as annoying as ryan
[05/06/2008 03:38:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha crystal is playing guitar hero, it's so cute!
[05/06/2008 03:38:45 PM] Leah Shanker: I think he's a piece of trash.

[05/12/2008 06:02:33 PM] Leah Shanker: It's very interesting with you!
[05/12/2008 06:02:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[05/12/2008 06:02:54 PM] Leah Shanker: Moon sign is your inner sign - who you are to yourself only.
[05/12/2008 06:03:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Aries makes you highly ambitious and kind of a do-without-thinking rationale
[05/12/2008 06:04:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/12/2008 06:04:19 PM] Leah Shanker: And Rising sign is your outer sign
[05/12/2008 06:04:32 PM] Leah Shanker: both of which are fire signs!
[05/12/2008 06:04:45 PM] Leah Shanker: no wonder you get in so much trouble for what you say :P
[05/12/2008 06:05:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/12/2008 06:05:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Your rising sign is kind of how you act toward other people
[05/12/2008 06:05:13 PM] Leah Shanker: your social face, essentially
[05/12/2008 06:05:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: blunt and indiscreet pretty much describes me
[05/12/2008 06:06:31 PM] Leah Shanker: very much not scorpio traits :) that explains a lot.
[05/12/2008 06:06:47 PM] Leah Shanker: My moon sign (inner) is Virgo and my rising (outer) is Taurus.
[05/12/2008 06:07:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Means inside I'm always worrying, but I have a very calm, socially approachable exterior.
[05/12/2008 06:08:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i can see that
[05/12/2008 06:09:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know how much i love to hear you vent
[05/12/2008 06:09:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe you share that inner side a little
[05/12/2008 06:10:11 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, maybe. But we're close so you get to see more of me than most.
[05/12/2008 06:18:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: *tear* she's gone!
[05/12/2008 06:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: back to being the lonely bachelor i guess
[05/12/2008 06:22:55 PM] Leah Shanker: nah, you're not a bachelor if you're connected :)
[05/12/2008 06:23:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[05/12/2008 06:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i think she loves me
[05/12/2008 06:23:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: who wouldn't though right?
[05/12/2008 06:23:41 PM] Leah Shanker: lol. 
[05/12/2008 06:23:54 PM] Leah Shanker: me, apparently. when i'm drunk.
[05/12/2008 06:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol yeah
[05/12/2008 06:24:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is kind of weird to hear about her last relationship.  all the things i do differently that make her happy.
[05/12/2008 06:25:00 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah...that's an awkward conversation.
[05/12/2008 06:25:14 PM] Leah Shanker: matt & i have tried to keep the details out when talking about that.
[05/12/2008 06:25:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah totally no details
[05/12/2008 06:25:40 PM] Leah Shanker: all i've heard is that his last gf/fiance was super boring and I'm much smarter and more exciting.
[05/12/2008 06:25:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah stuff like that
[05/12/2008 06:25:56 PM] Leah Shanker: and that he is a much more respectful human being than my last asshole boyfriend.
[05/12/2008 06:25:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i mean the little things like making her breakfast this morning
[05/12/2008 06:26:06 PM] Leah Shanker: aw :)
[05/12/2008 06:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/12/2008 06:26:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: or when i go to see her obviously i am going to get her flowers
[05/12/2008 06:26:35 PM] Leah Shanker: aw, how sweet.
[05/12/2008 06:26:39 PM] Leah Shanker: but don't do it regularly!
[05/12/2008 06:26:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: to me it is just a given, something i should do.  but i guess she never got flowers from steve.
[05/12/2008 06:26:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean the first time i go see her in tuscan
[05/12/2008 06:27:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and take her out on a date
[05/12/2008 06:27:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways
[05/12/2008 06:27:32 PM] Leah Shanker: awww
[05/12/2008 06:27:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: relationships are fun, and always a good experience, i hope steve is ok.
[05/12/2008 06:28:04 PM] Leah Shanker: he's being selfish now.
[05/12/2008 06:28:19 PM] Leah Shanker: i told him he probably shouldn't go to her graduation.
[05/12/2008 06:28:22 PM] Leah Shanker: not talk to her ever.
[05/12/2008 06:28:28 PM] Leah Shanker: since that's what it takes to move on.
[05/12/2008 06:28:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/12/2008 06:28:38 PM] Leah Shanker: and now, instead of trying to support her
[05/12/2008 06:28:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is hard
[05/12/2008 06:28:48 PM] Leah Shanker: he's doing this just because he can't let go.
[05/12/2008 06:29:18 PM] Leah Shanker: which is selfish! if you love someone, you'll want them to be happy
[05/12/2008 06:30:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i felt similar after my first girlfriend in highschool, i couldn't let go.  and my best friend from highschool started dating her, they even made their dating anniversary before we broke up!
[05/12/2008 06:30:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i eventually let go, now i don't hold anything against him for it.  but it was hard for me for a good year
[05/12/2008 06:30:39 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, that must be super hard.
[05/12/2008 06:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i was so naive.  funny thing though, they are engaged, and they fight ALL the time!
[05/12/2008 06:31:29 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, some people are just like that tho
[05/12/2008 06:31:35 PM] Leah Shanker: not really unhealthy, just the way they are.
[05/12/2008 06:31:40 PM] Leah Shanker: my parents always fight
[05/12/2008 06:31:53 PM] Leah Shanker: but they love each other dearly, fights kind of keep it interesting.
[05/12/2008 06:32:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but other people see their relationship as very unhealthy, for example they broke up because Eric wanted to go meet new people and make friends, and i sort of pushed him to be more outgoing freshmen year
[05/12/2008 06:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: but they fight over stupid things
[05/12/2008 06:33:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe your right, i always wish them the best
[05/12/2008 06:33:31 PM] Leah Shanker: yup, hatred burns your soul.
[05/12/2008 06:33:51 PM] Leah Shanker: for all the shit i've gone through, I try to find the strength to forgive.
[05/12/2008 06:34:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i never understood why people settle for just OK, relationships should always wonderful
[05/12/2008 06:34:12 PM] Leah Shanker: i completely agree.
[05/12/2008 06:34:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: would you say that you and matt have a great relationship?
[05/12/2008 06:34:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you never seem to fight, maybe over little disagreements
[05/12/2008 06:34:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying that should never happen, it is what makes people grow together
[05/12/2008 06:34:51 PM] Leah Shanker: absolutely. things do get tough when we're both working, but for the most part we're kindred spirits.
[05/12/2008 06:35:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, we had a little bit of a spat a month ago or so when school was really insane.
[05/12/2008 06:35:30 PM] Leah Shanker: Both of us would have rather just worked on school stuff than been with eachother doing lovey things.
[05/12/2008 06:36:23 PM] Leah Shanker: After that night I screamed at Joe, I was crying all night. And not even because of Joe - it's just that when someone breaks my emotional shell like that all my emotions come pouring out.
[05/12/2008 06:36:52 PM] Leah Shanker: So I told him that I wished we were a more cohesive couple - he never used to stand up for me or take my side or anything, we were just these independent spirits.
[05/12/2008 06:37:01 PM] Leah Shanker: I think after that was our turning point.
[05/12/2008 06:37:16 PM] Leah Shanker: He continuously amazes me with his thoughtfulness.
[05/12/2008 06:37:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry, this is probably super boring for you.
[05/12/2008 06:37:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[05/12/2008 06:37:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is wonderful
[05/12/2008 06:38:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: no it isn't boring
[05/12/2008 06:38:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys get along so well, crystal tells me i am thoughtful, and i try not to be selfish
[05/12/2008 06:39:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i remind her a lot that she can talk to me, and to tell me how she's feeling.  she said she wasn't used to expressing herself like that.  I get it from my mother, but my father is very closed when it comes to saying what is on his mind
[05/12/2008 06:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: communication has always been really important to me, and it looks like you and matt have it down great.
[05/12/2008 06:40:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, communication is the most important thing in a relationship.
[05/12/2008 06:40:59 PM] Leah Shanker: If I can give you a tip with a cappy, though.
[05/12/2008 06:41:13 PM] Leah Shanker: We definitely need help, but we never ask for it.
[05/12/2008 06:41:28 PM] Leah Shanker: So it's going to take a little intuition on your part to help out Crystal when she needs it.
[05/12/2008 06:42:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i have seen that a little.  i think my persistence on knowing how she feels about things will help me figure out what she needs.
[05/12/2008 06:43:08 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, and INSIST on helping :)
[05/12/2008 06:43:45 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, i'm gonna go make some nom noms
[05/12/2008 06:43:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: nomnomnom
[05/12/2008 06:43:57 PM] Leah Shanker: talk to you a bit later, maybe we should do something tonight

[05/12/2008 10:34:37 PM] Leah Shanker: good :)
[05/12/2008 10:35:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: he thought maybe if things need to be tweaked later he can come to us to change some things for a fixed price
[05/12/2008 10:35:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i said that sounded reasonable and would be a lot easier then doing and entire site
[05/12/2008 10:36:21 PM] Leah Shanker: cool, good.
[05/12/2008 10:36:54 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, no way we were going to work for free. Both of us have really nice resumes. We don't really need his no-name company internship experience.
[05/12/2008 10:37:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, true
[05/12/2008 10:37:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: he said that he would be willing to pay, but i doubt it would have been worth it still
[05/12/2008 10:45:51 PM] Leah Shanker:  Hey! are you gonna get on lotro or what?
[05/12/2008 10:45:58 PM] Leah Shanker: I need six people to form my kinship

[05/13/2008 01:27:36 AM] Leah Shanker: haha, probably bad idea.

[05/13/2008 03:16:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: it only gets better from here
[05/13/2008 03:16:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: that it like the minimum gui options
[05/13/2008 03:16:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: to use on like a phone or something
[05/13/2008 03:16:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: a crappy phone without safari that is
[05/13/2008 03:16:48 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[05/13/2008 03:17:14 PM] Leah Shanker: it would be cool if you could interface that with your playstation media center
[05/13/2008 03:17:24 PM] Leah Shanker: searchability would really help you, since you ahve so much music
[05/13/2008 03:17:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: working on it
[05/13/2008 03:18:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: potentially it should be able to automatically tailor itself to any system
[05/13/2008 03:19:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have it abstracted so that it is easy to create templates with different types of functionality
[05/13/2008 03:19:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so eventually it will do a whole bunch of nifty ajax stuff
[05/13/2008 03:19:51 PM] Leah Shanker: cool
[05/13/2008 03:20:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am toying with the idea of having a scrollbar on the left that changes to the size of the results but uses ajax to only display the number of visible items at a time
[05/13/2008 03:20:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: to save memory of course
[05/13/2008 03:21:03 PM] Leah Shanker: cool

[05/13/2008 05:45:12 PM] Leah Shanker: so i've heard
[05/13/2008 05:45:39 PM] Leah Shanker: so where did you find out about game club?
[05/13/2008 05:46:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i went to gameclub last summer!
[05/13/2008 05:46:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: 1one
[05/13/2008 05:46:35 PM] Leah Shanker: how did you find out that they were starting up again i mean.
[05/13/2008 05:46:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just assumed
[05/13/2008 05:46:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't remember me because i didn't know you, and i only went a few weeks, and i was totally intimidated by you
[05/13/2008 05:47:09 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i get that a lot.
[05/13/2008 05:47:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: you were like that cute redhead nerd chick to me, and i am super shy around girls that is why i didn't talk to you
[05/13/2008 05:48:30 PM] Leah Shanker: i remember you were there with mcdave, but you guys never came back
[05/13/2008 05:48:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: we came a few times
[05/13/2008 05:49:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: should i bring the lappy to play lotro
[05/13/2008 05:49:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[05/13/2008 05:49:33 PM] Leah Shanker: that's ok, I should probably tell you this.
[05/13/2008 05:49:49 PM] Leah Shanker: We invited Steve and since it would be awkward with both of you there
[05/13/2008 05:50:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve's kind of been coming to game club regularly before you, so...
[05/13/2008 05:50:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you don't want me to go
[05/13/2008 05:51:36 PM] Leah Shanker: it's not really up to me. if it were a party I was throwing, you'd be on the list
[05/13/2008 05:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i haven't been coming to vdub 2, i totally came to gameclub before him last summer
[05/13/2008 05:51:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not on abe's list?
[05/13/2008 05:52:10 PM] Leah Shanker: it's not about favorites & lits
[05/13/2008 05:52:13 PM] Leah Shanker: lists*
[05/13/2008 05:52:45 PM] Leah Shanker: partially, we want to take steve out and have a good time so he's not in a hole while he has a hard time with a breakup
[05/13/2008 05:53:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: w/e
[05/13/2008 05:53:14 PM] Leah Shanker: this whole situation has created this two-group tension
[05/13/2008 05:53:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: I think i'll order some papa johns
[05/13/2008 05:54:20 PM] Leah Shanker: don't think of this as a slight against you, we just don't want an awkward situation.
[05/13/2008 05:55:06 PM] Leah Shanker: we have the whole summer, we'll hang out some other time, where steve won't be invited.
[05/13/2008 05:55:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just don't recall ever seeing him last summer
[05/13/2008 05:55:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i started participating in game club
[05/13/2008 05:55:49 PM] Leah Shanker: he has been going regularly for a while, before you got there.
[05/13/2008 05:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: so just make sure Abe's knows i'd like to talk to him about the GUI plugin for Slagcore

[05/13/2008 05:57:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Later tonight, I'll bring over some wine or whatever you prefer to drink and we'll play some games or something
[05/13/2008 05:59:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i appreciate you being honest, and always there to keep the peace.  And maybe it would be good for me to skip game club tonight.  But i think you and everyone should know i have totally been looking forward to it.  And eventually Steve is going to have to face the facts.  He wasn't my friend before i met Crystal.  Shit happens...
[05/13/2008 05:59:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: obviously i would never tell him that, but that is what it comes down to.
[05/13/2008 06:05:11 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey, I hear you. And as soon as all this blows over, things will be back to normal without all these divided parties.
[05/13/2008 06:06:03 PM] Leah Shanker: But for now, don't take it personally, because it isn't about whether we like either of you better.

[05/19/2008 02:38:23 PM] Leah Shanker: They're more about geek & hacker culture than anything deeply technical

[05/19/2008 02:41:35 PM] Leah Shanker: He's not so much into computer security and he doesn't seem like a geeky partier.

[05/19/2008 02:47:18 PM] Leah Shanker: The NAU ACM student organization maintains a website, which includes an upcoming gaming events calendar and a discussion forum. The gaming events calendar lists all upcoming gaming events with a helpful day-before e-mail reminder service so students can stay informed.
 
 Most incoming freshman are a part of the Facebook social networking group, which allows students to be a part of the "NAU Network" so they may keep in touch with classmates and be part of a college community. The NAU ACM club has embraced this new technology by listing all upcoming Digital Carnivals as "Facebook Events", which allow us to advertise and estimate attendance from the number of RSVPs.

Session Start (bjcullinan:Leah Shanker): Tue May 27 16:50:39 2008
[05/27/2008 04:50:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you guys like vote on whether or not i am allowed to come to game club?
[05/27/2008 04:51:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've had 3 people tell me already
[05/27/2008 04:51:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: this whole situations seems pretty effing pathetic, steve doesn't want to participate in ACM anymore?
[05/27/2008 04:52:44 PM] Leah Shanker: so we've done all we can as friends of both of you. when the situation was still fresh and new we kind of deliberately didn't invite one of you when the other was coming, etc.
[05/27/2008 04:53:10 PM] Leah Shanker: but now that the situation is (should be) cooled down by now, we're going to stop doing that and both of you are just going to have to be mature.
[05/27/2008 04:53:41 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm not saying you weren't, btw, I'm just saying now we're not making any special exclusions anymore.
[05/27/2008 04:53:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys didn't have to in the first place
[05/27/2008 04:54:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that disappoints me that you did
[05/27/2008 04:54:07 PM] Leah Shanker: we were being nice, and trying to avoid awkward social situations.
[05/27/2008 04:55:19 PM] Leah Shanker: We were trying to make it as easy as possible for everyone (mostly Steve).
[05/27/2008 04:55:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: the more i learn about crystal's ex-boyfriend the less sorry for him i feel
[05/27/2008 04:56:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though i always try and take everything with a biased opinion when it is coming from her, but i really can't feel bad about what happened anymore
[05/27/2008 04:56:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve is our friend also, and no matter the circumstances, we're still trying to be good friends.
[05/27/2008 04:58:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i completely understand that, but he was not my friend, so i guess i would just appreciate it if you all just let me know when people finally decide to get over it.

Session Start (bjcullinan:Leah Shanker): Tue May 27 17:05:22 2008
[05/27/2008 05:05:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Can I be honest with you for a second?
[05/27/2008 05:05:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can always be honest with me
[05/27/2008 05:06:56 PM] Leah Shanker: If you had just kept your pants zipped that night, this would have been a severely less awkward situation. And I understand that telling yourself that Steve wasn't your friend makes it easier to accept that you've trampled him, but I can't manage to listen to you while you try to make it our fault.
[05/27/2008 05:07:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i completely agree with you
[05/27/2008 05:07:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it is not your fault
[05/27/2008 05:07:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: at most i am just venting to you
[05/27/2008 05:08:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and not stopping her and giving steve the shaft was a mistake i will have to live with
[05/27/2008 05:08:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: knowing that i didn't always take the high road
[05/27/2008 05:09:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: knowing that i could have been a better person
[05/27/2008 05:09:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but these are things we have to live with, and if i were in steve's position, i be handling it entirely differently
[05/27/2008 05:10:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: mainly not creating a division on social groups
[05/27/2008 05:12:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have trouble looking my roommate in the eye, because there are so many things i would like to say to him like "fuck you, you think you're better then me; well your not", and "you have always been an asshole to me, but i let it slide because i saw potential, and i fucking hate doing the dishes every god damn day wondering if you are ever going to offer to help do something around here."
[05/27/2008 05:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i learn how to deal with those things
[05/27/2008 05:13:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't hold anyone accountable for the bad that has happened in my life, except for me
[05/27/2008 05:14:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am angry at my roommate because he knows how to make me feel like the asshole
[05/27/2008 05:14:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is just me venting
[05/27/2008 05:14:58 PM] Leah Shanker: you shouldn't be around people who make you feel down all the time.
[05/27/2008 05:15:13 PM] Leah Shanker: if it's a constant source of negative energy, no matter what it is, sever it.
[05/27/2008 05:15:20 PM] Leah Shanker: find another roommate
[05/27/2008 05:16:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is just the nature of living with someone that you never get a break from
[05/27/2008 05:16:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: seeing them everyday, things get amplified
[05/27/2008 05:16:29 PM] Leah Shanker: haha, I told myself that during my long, drawn-out abusive relationship.
[05/27/2008 05:16:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i learn how to live with it
[05/27/2008 05:16:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i understand what you mean
[05/27/2008 05:17:01 PM] Leah Shanker: it gets better, there are people who can be roommates with effectively who don't get on your nerves very often.
[05/27/2008 05:17:08 PM] Leah Shanker: and if there isn't, don't live with anyone.
[05/27/2008 05:18:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am good at lot letting things change me, my father is far more emotionally abusive, but i know how to stroke situations just right to turn them around to work for me.
[05/27/2008 05:18:56 PM] Leah Shanker: but you shouldn't have to, you should just choose your friends and roommates so that you're around positive energy.
[05/27/2008 05:19:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know i am just as thick skinned and thick headed and blunt as the first day we met
[05/27/2008 05:19:49 PM] Leah Shanker: Yup, you've just gotten a bit better at social finesse.
[05/27/2008 05:21:49 PM] Leah Shanker: A little bit, anyway ;) I'd like to think I had something to do with that.
[05/27/2008 05:21:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah definitely
[05/27/2008 05:22:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that still doesn't change the fact that i want to go to game club
[05/27/2008 05:23:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i don't want anyone missing out on ACM on my behalf
[05/27/2008 05:23:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve never really was involved with ACM.

[05/27/2008 05:26:35 PM] Leah Shanker: oh speaking on ACM
[05/27/2008 05:26:37 PM] Leah Shanker: of*
[05/27/2008 05:26:59 PM] Leah Shanker: Eck approved my graduation cords idea and now we have a set for ACM members.
[05/27/2008 05:27:48 PM] Leah Shanker: He also mentioned specific honorary cords, too. Highest GPA, Chair's Honor, etc. We can talk about it more in the fall.
[05/27/2008 05:28:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: cool
[05/27/2008 05:31:51 PM] Leah Shanker: So you're not banned from Brainstorm - we repost all the things we talked about at game club there. I know it sucks not coming to the meetings, but I don't really have a say in the B/S - it's kind of Abe's gig.
[05/27/2008 05:32:51 PM] Leah Shanker: B/S is Leahnese for "The Brian/Steve Inversely Proportional Graph
[05/27/2008 05:32:53 PM] Leah Shanker: "
[05/27/2008 05:33:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have an illustration of this graph?
[05/27/2008 05:33:27 PM] Leah Shanker: lol.
[05/27/2008 05:33:31 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, lemme make one
[05/27/2008 05:33:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just can't help but feel like "i thought he liked me better then this".
[05/27/2008 05:42:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you really are a great friend
[05/27/2008 05:42:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i hope you are always honest with me
[05/27/2008 05:42:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need honest friends
[05/27/2008 05:42:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: like Richard too
[05/27/2008 05:43:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though sometimes my heart sinks when people are too honest, and i know i am wrong but to prideful to admit it, honest friends are always there to keep me in line
[05/27/2008 05:43:39 PM] Leah Shanker: thanks :) yeah, richard is a good guy

[05/27/2008 05:56:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to do that to make me feel better

[05/27/2008 06:15:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Plus I can follow Kevin Rose & Merlin Mann and other inspiring full-of-energy people and see what they're up to on a daily basis. It's actually pretty interesting.
[05/27/2008 06:19:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am afraid if i posted frequent updates of my life that i would be a little too honest
[05/27/2008 06:19:50 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[05/27/2008 06:20:09 PM] Leah Shanker: have you heard of ijustine?

[05/27/2008 06:58:48 PM] Leah Shanker: she was on G4 with Leo Laporte
[05/27/2008 06:59:07 PM] Leah Shanker: now she does lifecasting, etc.
[05/27/2008 06:59:19 PM] Leah Shanker: various blogs, talks at conferences.
[05/27/2008 06:59:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i made fun her
[05/27/2008 06:59:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: when she was on G4
[05/27/2008 06:59:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: she was the loopy blonde that they have to have so kids keep watching
[05/27/2008 07:00:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: lifecasting
[05/27/2008 07:00:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: is not a real job
[05/27/2008 07:00:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: neither is making fun of video games, like they always do on G4
[05/27/2008 07:01:16 PM] Leah Shanker: this is true, but she's tech-savvy and funny
[05/27/2008 07:01:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying critic is not a real job, but G4 consistently disappoints me because of it's lack of intellectual depth
[05/27/2008 07:02:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but shes cute, and seems pretty funny
[05/27/2008 07:02:47 PM] Leah Shanker: plus her tweets are filled with new blog posts and funny videos.

[05/27/2008 07:11:13 PM] Leah Shanker: yaaaaaay
[05/27/2008 07:12:13 PM] Leah Shanker: omg i can buy her makeup set.
[05/27/2008 07:12:31 PM] Leah Shanker: srsly, I need girlfriends.
[05/27/2008 07:17:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is the address!
[05/27/2008 07:17:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: she wears too much makeup
[05/27/2008 07:17:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't need makeup, you are beautiful the way you are
[05/27/2008 07:17:24 PM] Leah Shanker: she's on camera, it's different.
[05/27/2008 07:17:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you insist, i am always a big fan of eye shadow
[05/27/2008 07:17:53 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I can't really do the eyeshadow. My glasses tend to steal the show.
[05/27/2008 07:18:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will go pick out makeup with you, what else is a bgf for!?
[05/27/2008 07:18:13 PM] Leah Shanker: But when I have contacts in, I love going crazy.
[05/27/2008 07:18:16 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[05/27/2008 07:18:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: when do you wear contacts?
[05/27/2008 07:18:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and why don't you more often!?
[05/27/2008 07:19:12 PM] Leah Shanker: I normally do when I'm going out and stuff. But I have such a harsh prescription that I can't wear them all the time, they make my eyes sore.
[05/27/2008 07:19:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/27/2008 07:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should get laser eye surgury
[05/27/2008 07:19:44 PM] Leah Shanker: I've thought about it, but it's too risky.
[05/27/2008 07:19:52 PM] Leah Shanker: If something goes wrong, my life is over.
[05/27/2008 07:20:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: are there risks? i thought it was pretty secure
[05/27/2008 07:20:24 PM] Leah Shanker: nah, I've done a bunch of research and talked to doctors and stuff.
[05/27/2008 07:20:45 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm a very bad candidate for eye surgery since my sight is so bad. It would take several surgeries. 
[05/27/2008 07:20:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: well obviously the standard eye doctors will be biased
[05/27/2008 07:21:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but could you do one surgery and lighten the load of the glasses?
[05/27/2008 07:21:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: or does it not work like that?
[05/27/2008 07:21:48 PM] Leah Shanker: yup, I could do that.
[05/27/2008 07:22:12 PM] Leah Shanker: But glasses & contacts aren't so bad
[05/27/2008 07:22:28 PM] Leah Shanker: and I can't help but think how much I would regret it if I went blind over an inconvenience.
[05/27/2008 07:23:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah totally
[05/27/2008 07:23:14 PM] Leah Shanker: So my contacts are a little annoying and my glasses make it hard to play with makeup.
[05/27/2008 07:23:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Eh.
[05/27/2008 07:23:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: good thing you don't need makeup then i guess ;-)

[05/30/2008 01:26:33 AM] Leah Shanker: you're rooming with richard & mcdave, right?

[05/30/2008 01:26:56 AM] Leah Shanker: that will be awkward
[05/30/2008 01:27:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: ...
[05/30/2008 01:27:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: obviously we aren't going to do anything
[05/30/2008 01:27:22 AM] Leah Shanker: right, but
[05/30/2008 01:27:25 AM] Leah Shanker: same bed, floor
[05/30/2008 01:27:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like the rooms on the defcon specials are standard rooms
[05/30/2008 01:27:42 AM] Leah Shanker: like, if I was rooming with my girlfriends, we'd all just sleep in the same bed no problem
[05/30/2008 01:27:56 AM] Leah Shanker: but if one of them brought a boyfriend, we'd all like, have to sleep on the couch or floor or something.
[05/30/2008 01:28:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: even if there are two beds?
[05/30/2008 01:28:19 AM] Leah Shanker: oh, ok, then you're o
[05/30/2008 01:28:20 AM] Leah Shanker: ok
[05/30/2008 01:28:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: plus a couch
[05/30/2008 01:28:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: which potentially could be a pull out
[05/30/2008 01:29:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: i got 1 room with 2 doubles in it, then there is a completely seperate (living room) with a couch
[05/30/2008 01:29:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: so 2 rooms
[05/30/2008 01:29:18 AM] Leah Shanker: nice
[05/30/2008 01:29:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: and mini kitchen
[05/30/2008 01:29:29 AM] Leah Shanker: that's kind of what we had for the stag & doe
[05/30/2008 01:29:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is only 40 dollars more a night, i think it is worth it to be able to spread out
[05/30/2008 01:30:05 AM] Leah Shanker: we had two huge suites, that were essentially 3 rooms hooked together plus a huge common living room & kitchen

[05/30/2008 01:30:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: sounds awesome
[05/30/2008 01:30:45 AM] Leah Shanker: yup, exactly
[05/30/2008 01:31:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i think the location of their suites will cost me longer elevator time
[05/30/2008 01:31:48 AM] Leah Shanker: omg.
[05/30/2008 01:32:03 AM] Leah Shanker: ok, so the penthouses are on the very top floor
[05/30/2008 01:32:07 AM] Leah Shanker: they're probably taken
[05/30/2008 01:32:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to figure out what speed they go, and factor in number of floors so i can estimate how much time i will lose drinking in the elevator
[05/30/2008 01:32:18 AM] Leah Shanker: the goons always have their awesome party on the top floor

[05/30/2008 01:34:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe i will gain time in the elevator
[05/30/2008 01:34:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: for being closer to goons
[05/30/2008 01:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: because i think the deluxe rooms are close to the top
[05/30/2008 01:34:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: based on the picture on the virtual tour page
[05/30/2008 01:35:58 AM] Leah Shanker: you are thinking too hard :)

[05/30/2008 01:36:27 AM] Leah Shanker: circling them, and then filling in the rest of your time
[05/30/2008 01:36:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think i will map out the conference center with a google map
[05/30/2008 01:36:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: and figure out how much time it takes for me to get from one speaker to the next
[05/30/2008 01:37:14 AM] Leah Shanker: so the really big name ones
[05/30/2008 01:37:37 AM] Leah Shanker: namely, anyone famous, fyodor, Zimmerman, Bruce Schneier, etc.
[05/30/2008 01:37:52 AM] Leah Shanker: You really have to stake out the room an hour beforehand to get a good spot in line
[05/30/2008 01:38:10 AM] Leah Shanker: so those ones, make sure you really plan ahead.
[05/30/2008 01:38:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see those names on the list

[05/30/2008 01:42:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: when was it?
[05/30/2008 01:42:45 AM] Leah Shanker: A little before the semester started, before we knew there would be a Computer Security class.
[05/30/2008 01:42:58 AM] Leah Shanker: the sudo people ended up in the same class anyway

[05/30/2008 01:44:04 AM] Leah Shanker: so drink soymilk
[05/30/2008 01:44:11 AM] Leah Shanker: same effect

[06/03/2008 11:53:08 PM] Leah Shanker: i thought you hadn't taken calc2 yet
[06/03/2008 11:53:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have
[06/03/2008 11:53:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: passed with a C but it felt like a B
[06/03/2008 11:53:39 PM] Leah Shanker: aw sweet
[06/03/2008 11:53:51 PM] Leah Shanker: so this integral falls under the "tricky u-sub" category
[06/03/2008 11:54:22 PM] Leah Shanker: x^5*sqrt(x^2+1)
[06/03/2008 11:54:34 PM] Leah Shanker: for the life of me I can't get it to work out
[06/03/2008 11:54:42 PM] Leah Shanker: I tried setting u to x^2 +1
[06/03/2008 11:54:56 PM] Leah Shanker: but I end up with 2x...which doesn't help.
[06/03/2008 11:54:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: sec let me write it out
[06/03/2008 11:55:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: man i am rusty
[06/03/2008 11:57:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes i like to use the integrator and work backwards
[06/03/2008 11:57:23 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i use my calc but the answer is really effing weird
[06/03/2008 11:57:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: use the integrator online from mathematica
[06/03/2008 11:57:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: the answer is long
[06/03/2008 11:57:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: strangely long
[06/03/2008 11:58:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if i had to guess, u should also include the sqrt
[06/03/2008 11:58:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: make it ^1/2 in parenthesis to help see it better
[06/03/2008 11:59:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://integrals.wolfram.com/index.jsp?expr=x%5E5*sqrt%28x%5E2%2B1%29&random=false)http://integrals.wolfram.com/index.jsp?expr=x%5E5*sqrt%28x%5E2%2B1%29&rando(Link: http://integrals.wolfram.com/index.jsp?expr=x%5E5*sqrt%28x%5E2%2B1%29&random=false)m=false
[06/04/2008 12:01:01 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, ive seen the answer I just can't figure out how to get there
[06/04/2008 12:01:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: who is your teacher?
[06/04/2008 12:01:43 AM] Leah Shanker: rushall

[06/04/2008 12:05:45 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i'm planning on it. but this is a summer class so there's less lecture time
[06/04/2008 12:05:50 AM] Leah Shanker: so he only does a max of like 4 questions
[06/04/2008 12:06:01 AM] Leah Shanker: and that really annoying guy in front always picks the easy ones
[06/04/2008 12:06:06 AM] Leah Shanker: effing guy. seriously should be shot.

[06/04/2008 12:09:31 AM] Leah Shanker: katrina & I have kind of formed a little study group, but the really hard ones that no one can solve usually end up not getting solved til he does it in class

[06/04/2008 12:22:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: just because they can be cut open to make bombs doesn't make acid dangerous
[06/04/2008 12:22:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D

[06/04/2008 12:22:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: if it stays on your skin for extended periods of time
[06/04/2008 12:22:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't make it melt
[06/04/2008 12:23:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: you can get a 1 degree burn from leaving it on for hours
[06/04/2008 12:23:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: and unlike some chemicals it doesn't soak through the skin
[06/04/2008 12:24:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: and poison your blood stream

[07/11/2008 10:22:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: hows it going?
[07/11/2008 10:24:24 PM] Leah Shanker: pretty good - have you seen the problem?
[07/11/2008 10:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: what problem?
[07/11/2008 10:24:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: for programming
[07/11/2008 10:24:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have not
[07/11/2008 10:24:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: working hard?
[07/11/2008 10:24:47 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah. it's a mars rover simulation
[07/11/2008 10:24:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow
[07/11/2008 10:24:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's intense
[07/11/2008 10:25:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like fun
[07/11/2008 10:25:08 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, it's pretty awesome. very intense AI problem.
[07/11/2008 10:25:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: wish i could be there to work on it
[07/11/2008 10:25:25 PM] Leah Shanker: we had a group of potential CS majors march by a little bit ago
[07/11/2008 10:25:34 PM] Leah Shanker: there's a girl's engineering camp happening currently
[07/11/2008 10:25:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg hot!
[07/11/2008 10:25:55 PM] Leah Shanker: and a group of them were in here checking out the acm game cabinet and helping us work on the rover problem
[07/11/2008 10:26:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: now i really with i could be there!
[07/11/2008 10:26:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: any cuties?
[07/11/2008 10:26:10 PM] Leah Shanker: ahaha
[07/11/2008 10:26:26 PM] Leah Shanker: well, they're all underage. not sure they qualify, heh.
[07/11/2008 10:26:30 PM] Leah Shanker: they're all high-school aged
[07/11/2008 10:26:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: underaged currently...
[07/11/2008 10:26:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[07/11/2008 10:26:42 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[07/11/2008 10:27:05 PM] Leah Shanker: but in a year we should see them, if we're still around
[07/11/2008 10:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have kind of a weird question for you
[07/11/2008 10:27:24 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, shoot
[07/11/2008 10:27:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but your opinion always matters to me
[07/11/2008 10:27:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it strange to be sexually adventurous?
[07/11/2008 10:27:53 PM] Leah Shanker: not at all
[07/11/2008 10:27:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: if both parties are consenting
[07/11/2008 10:28:04 PM] Leah Shanker: absolutely not.
[07/11/2008 10:28:12 PM] Leah Shanker: but if you're talking about a threesome, it never works out :)
[07/11/2008 10:28:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: for anyone?
[07/11/2008 10:28:19 PM] Leah Shanker: it always gets weird.
[07/11/2008 10:28:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: funny you bring that up
[07/11/2008 10:28:48 PM] Leah Shanker: ahaha, is that what you were talking about?
[07/11/2008 10:28:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: because crystal wants to
[07/11/2008 10:28:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/11/2008 10:29:09 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, I know it sounds like a really great idea, but you will regret it.
[07/11/2008 10:29:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i was skeptical, and i heard what you just said before
[07/11/2008 10:29:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: you aren't the first to tell me that
[07/11/2008 10:29:24 PM] Leah Shanker: especially if it's with someone you know
[07/11/2008 10:29:43 PM] Leah Shanker: if anything, let it be a total stranger you'll never see again.
[07/11/2008 10:29:48 PM] Leah Shanker: like, say someone at defcon, lol.
[07/11/2008 10:30:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: well there is someone we had in mind, and we don't know her very well at all
[07/11/2008 10:30:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i wonder what makes it weird
[07/11/2008 10:30:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i am definitely not attracted to her more then crystal
[07/11/2008 10:30:41 PM] Leah Shanker: psychologically?
[07/11/2008 10:30:49 PM] Leah Shanker: it's more of a gesture weirdness.
[07/11/2008 10:31:09 PM] Leah Shanker: sex is supposedly an act of love, so it gives weird implications.
[07/11/2008 10:31:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am definitely not psychologically more attracted to her
[07/11/2008 10:31:20 PM] Leah Shanker: no, that's not ever the problem.
[07/11/2008 10:31:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[07/11/2008 10:31:51 PM] Leah Shanker: it's not just the superficial "you're paying more attention to her than me" thing you think will be the problem
[07/11/2008 10:32:03 PM] Leah Shanker: it's really a more deeply ingrained weirdness I can't really explain.
[07/11/2008 10:32:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[07/11/2008 10:32:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i'm not saying i'd ever have a threesome, it was just something we talked about
[07/11/2008 10:33:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will definitely have to keep that in mind
[07/11/2008 10:33:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, you should probably keep it solely just a fantasy if you value your relationship
[07/11/2008 10:34:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i definitely value the relationship
[07/11/2008 10:34:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there are plenty of other adventurous things to do in the bedroom
[07/11/2008 10:34:33 PM] Leah Shanker: most certainly
[07/11/2008 10:34:39 PM] Leah Shanker: more fun things :)
[07/11/2008 10:35:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not fishing for details but she is having trouble being creative, is there anything you might suggest
[07/11/2008 10:35:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: again don't answer if it would be weird
[07/11/2008 10:35:48 PM] Leah Shanker: blindfolds and food
[07/11/2008 10:35:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been doing some reading
[07/11/2008 10:36:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is a good idea
[07/11/2008 10:36:01 PM] Leah Shanker: those have been my new favorite adventures.
[07/11/2008 10:36:45 PM] Leah Shanker: and candlewax is kind of a cliche sort of thing, but it's adventurous.
[07/11/2008 10:36:53 PM] Leah Shanker: it's new, if you don't like it, don't do it again, heh
[07/11/2008 10:37:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i thought of picking up some candles of some favorite scents
[07/11/2008 10:37:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: bed bath and beyond has become one of my favorite stores
[07/11/2008 10:38:02 PM] Leah Shanker: aw, that's adorable
[07/11/2008 10:38:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been doing some reading too
[07/11/2008 10:38:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: about taboo sex and how women think about fantasies that aren't necessarily something that should become a reality 
[07/11/2008 10:39:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i just thought the 3 way would be interesting since i wasn't the one who thought of it
[07/11/2008 10:39:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: she is more then enough for me!
[07/11/2008 10:39:32 PM] Leah Shanker: think of it more as a gesture of her love
[07/11/2008 10:39:42 PM] Leah Shanker: she's willing to do it for you because she thinks you may enjoy it
[07/11/2008 10:39:54 PM] Leah Shanker: or she may even enjoy it too, whatever
[07/11/2008 10:40:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i guess i hadn't considered that
[07/11/2008 10:40:03 PM] Leah Shanker: but if it happens, I promise it will be weird.
[07/11/2008 10:40:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: well thanks for the suggestion
[07/11/2008 10:40:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should probably get back to working right?
[07/11/2008 10:40:46 PM] Leah Shanker: yup! we're in the midst of getting our code up on the svn server
[07/11/2008 10:40:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a shower, i hiked up a mountain today
[07/11/2008 10:41:04 PM] Leah Shanker: damn, good for you.
[07/11/2008 10:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: have fun with the project!
[07/11/2008 10:41:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i could be there
[07/11/2008 10:41:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will have to hang out when i get back

[07/14/2008 11:03:21 AM] Leah Shanker: flip a coin! :)
[07/14/2008 11:03:27 AM] Leah Shanker: no, what's that?
[07/14/2008 11:06:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: should i keep using my treo with windows mobile 6 or use palm OS on a brand new palm centro?
[07/14/2008 11:06:32 AM] Leah Shanker: ooh, buy a 3G iPhone.
[07/14/2008 11:06:52 AM] Leah Shanker: Palm OS effs up your display
[07/14/2008 11:06:58 AM] Leah Shanker: that would annoy me.
[07/14/2008 11:07:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: effs up the display?
[07/14/2008 11:07:25 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah, it's only like 320 display instead of the full phone capability.
[07/14/2008 11:08:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: on the centro i thought is was 320 native
[07/14/2008 11:08:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is smaller then the treo
[07/14/2008 11:09:12 AM] Leah Shanker: ah, ok. then you should be fine. windows is worse for battery power and not a lot of supported apps
[07/14/2008 11:09:29 AM] Leah Shanker: but, it's personal preference.
[07/14/2008 11:09:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: palm os would make me more 1337
[07/14/2008 11:10:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: but then i would be a conformist in the "not using windows"

[07/16/2008 04:54:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought you usually did those
[07/16/2008 04:54:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I would rather not, especially with everything on my plate now and the coming semester.
[07/16/2008 04:54:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: richard is pretty good

[07/16/2008 04:58:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: very strange how people prioritize
[07/16/2008 04:58:41 PM] Leah Shanker: He called me last Friday, I didn't answer and he didn't leave a voicemail.
[07/16/2008 04:58:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: weird
[07/16/2008 04:58:49 PM] Leah Shanker: So it seems as if he's still alive :)

[07/16/2008 05:00:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know how sometimes you get an album and there are some crappy songs and some good ones?

[07/22/2008 02:57:22 PM] Leah Shanker: I can't forget that hilarious scene with the other drug dealer

[07/22/2008 02:57:38 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh nice, i should download it
[07/22/2008 02:57:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: fa' sho'
[07/22/2008 02:58:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: see the new batman?
[07/22/2008 02:58:50 PM] Leah Shanker: fuck yes, it rocked my socks.
[07/22/2008 02:58:55 PM] Leah Shanker: but MAN
[07/22/2008 02:59:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/22/2008 02:59:11 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe is my movie buddy, I normally go see everything with him
[07/22/2008 02:59:31 PM] Leah Shanker: but he does this slightly annoying thing where he picks apart a particular scene
[07/22/2008 02:59:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahah
[07/22/2008 02:59:44 PM] Leah Shanker: like "oh I liked it, except for this one scene with this one thing - didn't make sense"
[07/22/2008 02:59:58 PM] Leah Shanker: after batman I was in this sort of trance
[07/22/2008 02:59:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahhaa example?
[07/22/2008 03:00:34 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe starts up with "My only gripe is that one scene with the guy with the grenade in his mouth - WHY DIDNT HE JUST SPIT IT OUT?"
[07/22/2008 03:00:44 PM] Leah Shanker: I literally put my fingers in my ears and went "LALALA"
[07/22/2008 03:00:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: batman is the fuckin shit, i want to spend like a year putting together a batman costume and try and get it to look exactly like the one in the movie
[07/22/2008 03:01:01 PM] Leah Shanker: aw fuck yeah
[07/22/2008 03:01:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like tron guy, i would be batman guy
[07/22/2008 03:01:19 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[07/22/2008 03:01:24 PM] Leah Shanker: you'd have to gain some weight and a pooch
[07/22/2008 03:01:28 PM] Leah Shanker: and have like a cop mustache
[07/22/2008 03:01:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: except not fat
[07/22/2008 03:01:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[07/22/2008 03:01:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i would skip that part
[07/22/2008 03:01:45 PM] Leah Shanker: Tronguy is funny because he's a dork tho
[07/22/2008 03:02:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would be in shape, i would have to do some body building to fill out the suit like christian bale does
[07/22/2008 03:02:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but tron is kind of a dork
[07/22/2008 03:02:20 PM] Leah Shanker: srsly. Dude, you and Ryan the stormtrooper could totally rock defcon together
[07/22/2008 03:02:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but since batman is awesome, i would be awesome too

[07/22/2008 03:02:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be awesome

[07/22/2008 03:51:32 PM] Leah Shanker: if I can keep my clothes on!
[07/22/2008 03:51:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha not sure about that
[07/22/2008 03:51:45 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[07/22/2008 03:51:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: my dad had an idea
[07/22/2008 03:51:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: that he would eventually invest in
[07/22/2008 03:52:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wants a digital signage system
[07/22/2008 03:52:30 PM] Leah Shanker: signature or like a display for a sign?
[07/22/2008 03:52:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: display for a sign
[07/22/2008 03:53:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: like a menu
[07/22/2008 03:53:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: at wendy's
[07/22/2008 03:53:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you go inside and there is the menu above the counter
[07/22/2008 03:53:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: he wants to make a sign that is digital, using lcd screens
[07/22/2008 03:53:52 PM] Leah Shanker: hm, interesting.
[07/22/2008 03:54:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i told him the software would be the hardest point, but entirely possible
[07/22/2008 03:54:14 PM] Leah Shanker: self-contained or hooked up to a pc?
[07/22/2008 03:54:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: self contained
[07/22/2008 03:54:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the trick
[07/22/2008 03:54:39 PM] Leah Shanker: hm, well, there are several parts to this problem
[07/22/2008 03:54:51 PM] Leah Shanker: software to me seems like the easiest part.
[07/22/2008 03:54:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/embedded/artigo/)http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/embedded/artigo/(Link: http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/embedded/artigo/)
[07/22/2008 03:55:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: easiest to us
[07/22/2008 03:55:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: but most important to him
[07/22/2008 03:55:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that baby solved our hardware problem
[07/22/2008 03:55:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: *solves
[07/22/2008 03:55:46 PM] Leah Shanker: so, the idea would be to sell individual sign kits with computer & software already loaded, correct?
[07/22/2008 03:55:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: exactly
[07/22/2008 03:56:08 PM] Leah Shanker: well, I would think
[07/22/2008 03:56:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: that box plus lcd screen plus really smart software
[07/22/2008 03:56:35 PM] Leah Shanker: It would be great to have a wireless card, so you can control what the sign says over the network.
[07/22/2008 03:56:45 PM] Leah Shanker: So, some computer in the back would be able to change content whenever.
[07/22/2008 03:57:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some of the resturants with an internet connection will have that option
[07/22/2008 03:57:21 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't think that box has wireless
[07/22/2008 03:57:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: no but it does have ethernet
[07/22/2008 03:57:50 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, but you can't really hook the "managers computer" in the back up to the sign.
[07/22/2008 03:58:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: with a long enough ethernet cable you could
[07/22/2008 03:58:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is all little stuff
[07/22/2008 03:58:33 PM] Leah Shanker: Right, but cords running down from the sign looks tacks.
[07/22/2008 03:58:36 PM] Leah Shanker: tacky*
[07/22/2008 03:58:41 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, for sure.
[07/22/2008 03:58:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: if need be, you just ship them a new box with the updated menu
[07/22/2008 03:58:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they send the only one back and you update those and send them somewhere else
[07/22/2008 03:59:15 PM] Leah Shanker: The idea is - a piece of software that reads data from some arbitrary file/place/whatever and displays it nicely on the screen with the company's logo and design.
[07/22/2008 03:59:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: obviously the cords would be hooked to the ceiling where you can't see them
[07/22/2008 03:59:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[07/22/2008 03:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: very nicely
[07/22/2008 03:59:44 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh, shipping boxes back and forth is a bad idea.
[07/22/2008 04:00:08 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, so I've dealt with small businesses before
[07/22/2008 04:00:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i figure has the ability to do a wget update to replace the files, that part can even be just a command line script
[07/22/2008 04:00:54 PM] Leah Shanker: They won't pay for updates
[07/22/2008 04:01:01 PM] Leah Shanker: and shipping boxes back and forth is a tedious job.
[07/22/2008 04:01:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: well it isn't a small business, if he wants to pursue the idea, the software would be used globally
[07/22/2008 04:01:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are talking wendy's corp here
[07/22/2008 04:01:23 PM] Leah Shanker: You don't think your market is small business?
[07/22/2008 04:01:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: not our problem
[07/22/2008 04:01:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Wendy's are franchises, I think.
[07/22/2008 04:02:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways, i was thinking maybe i could get a few hundred bucks to pay for a tech demo, but i write it alone
[07/22/2008 04:03:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: *i can't write it alone
[07/22/2008 04:04:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was thinking of maybe finding a hacked down copy of linux, getting an artigo, and writing software that can load a few images and transition between those and playing a video file

[07/22/2008 04:05:35 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, I actually just finished up two dimensional design a few weeks ago
[07/22/2008 04:05:46 PM] Leah Shanker: I'll have to see what I can come up with
[07/22/2008 04:06:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Powerpoint slides would be great...
[07/22/2008 04:06:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Those menus look like powerpoint to me.
[07/22/2008 04:06:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey, I'll be back in like 20 mins.
[07/22/2008 04:06:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: also i would like to have a script that downloads new content from a fixed domain and a web interface that allows you to upload a new image
[07/22/2008 04:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what i was thinking powerpoint
[07/22/2008 04:07:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: in which case the editing content online would be the most important thing
[07/22/2008 04:21:25 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, so I thought about it while I was out for coffee
[07/22/2008 04:21:39 PM] Leah Shanker: The best selling point for a large corporation
[07/22/2008 04:21:46 PM] Leah Shanker: is to make things easier for managers.
[07/22/2008 04:22:24 PM] Leah Shanker: So have all of the content read from the corporate headquarters website - that way they'll always be up to date with whatever advertising campaign they're doing
[07/22/2008 04:22:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/22/2008 04:22:52 PM] Leah Shanker: a manager doesn't want to waste their time changing the signs...
[07/22/2008 04:22:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i disagree, corporate can afford to send out the new boxes
[07/22/2008 04:23:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: but yes i agree, managers should have to do anything
[07/22/2008 04:23:18 PM] Leah Shanker: but why should they if there's an alternative?
[07/22/2008 04:23:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless they don't have internet
[07/22/2008 04:23:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: well obviously they won't send new ones to the stores with a connection
[07/22/2008 04:23:48 PM] Leah Shanker: right. If they don't have internet, they can ship out CDs or something.
[07/22/2008 04:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: or how about a USB stick!
[07/22/2008 04:24:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: since the box doesn't have a cd drive
[07/22/2008 04:24:18 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh, that's a good idea.
[07/22/2008 04:24:25 PM] Leah Shanker: and it could even be self-loading.
[07/22/2008 04:24:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when it boots it automatically check a signature on the usb stick and copies the files
[07/22/2008 04:24:42 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh, dangerous.
[07/22/2008 04:24:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: not on linux
[07/22/2008 04:25:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: on linux we configure it to always boot from the hard drive, but it will check the usb stick for updates
[07/22/2008 04:26:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and with it coming in an envelope straight from corporate it will be ok
[07/22/2008 04:26:23 PM] Leah Shanker: well, what if some punk kid working at wendys wants to load porn on the display?
[07/22/2008 04:26:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what the signature is for
[07/22/2008 04:26:53 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, that's what I was thinking too.
[07/22/2008 04:27:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: filenames filesizes all of that are serialized into the signature
[07/22/2008 04:28:19 PM] Leah Shanker: so you've already decided on the box?
[07/22/2008 04:28:29 PM] Leah Shanker: what about an lcd display with a computer inside?
[07/22/2008 04:28:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the artigo is a great idea
[07/22/2008 04:28:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what distro can we sell?
[07/22/2008 04:28:43 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, not many.
[07/22/2008 04:29:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: can we sell non open source on top of the distro and give away the operating system?
[07/22/2008 04:29:50 PM] Leah Shanker: legally, what we're developing is an application.
[07/22/2008 04:29:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/22/2008 04:30:02 PM] Leah Shanker: an application which isn't covered under GPL
[07/22/2008 04:30:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it will work
[07/22/2008 04:30:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: potentially
[07/22/2008 04:30:28 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, we'll have to look specifically into that.
[07/22/2008 04:30:38 PM] Leah Shanker: and with all the linux lawsuits going on...
[07/22/2008 04:30:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: but all we have to worry about now is a tech demo
[07/22/2008 04:31:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need an engine that can show images in one part of the screen and a video in another part
[07/22/2008 04:32:12 PM] Leah Shanker: alternatively...we don't need to even write software...
[07/22/2008 04:32:35 PM] Leah Shanker: if we distribute linux with openoffice and use the powerpoint equivalent to display the content
[07/22/2008 04:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[07/22/2008 04:33:15 PM] Leah Shanker: and just design some nice looking powerpoint slides...
[07/22/2008 04:34:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/22/2008 04:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: but should they really have to design new slides at corporate
[07/22/2008 04:34:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess it doesn't matter
[07/22/2008 04:35:21 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, they could do it either way.
[07/22/2008 04:35:36 PM] Leah Shanker: it depends on whatever the company wants.
[07/22/2008 04:35:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[07/22/2008 04:35:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that will work for the tech demo
[07/22/2008 04:37:36 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, guess you don't need me anymore :)
[07/22/2008 04:38:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm

[08/12/2008 02:42:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/12/2008 02:42:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: no strippers..
[08/12/2008 02:42:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: this time
[08/12/2008 02:43:45 PM] Leah Shanker: You know, we didn't go to the hackerpimps party last year.
[08/12/2008 02:43:54 PM] Leah Shanker: This was the first time we went to a party with strippers.
[08/12/2008 02:44:05 PM] Leah Shanker: and IMHO it made the party vibe awkward for conversation & dancing.
[08/12/2008 02:45:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: we were dancing
[08/12/2008 02:45:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys left
[08/12/2008 02:45:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you can't really say
[08/12/2008 02:45:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but we danced a lot
[08/12/2008 02:45:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: an then the strippers left
[08/12/2008 02:45:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we danced more
[08/12/2008 02:45:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i danced on the table
[08/12/2008 02:46:19 PM] Leah Shanker: What do you mean I can't really say? Uh, I was there.
[08/12/2008 02:46:23 PM] Leah Shanker: It was awkward. Nuff said.
[08/12/2008 02:46:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you were there for half of it
[08/12/2008 02:47:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, because it was awkward.
[08/12/2008 02:47:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: then richard showed up
[08/12/2008 02:47:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he didn't mind
[08/12/2008 02:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you know how prudish richard is
[08/12/2008 02:47:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we danced
[08/12/2008 02:48:49 PM] Leah Shanker: So the fact that Richard didn't mind made it not awkward?
[08/12/2008 02:49:13 PM] Leah Shanker: I was there, it was awkward. It's difficult to have a meaningful conversation with someone when there are girls having sex on the table.
[08/12/2008 02:49:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am saying it got less awkward and more fun as the night when on
[08/12/2008 02:49:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you and matt tend to jump the gun on leaving
[08/12/2008 02:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: you miss stuff
[08/12/2008 02:49:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Nah, we tend to prefer to make the talks.
[08/12/2008 02:49:51 PM] Leah Shanker: You know, the conference.
[08/12/2008 02:50:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because something is a little awkward doesn't mean you have to run the other direction
[08/12/2008 02:50:05 PM] Leah Shanker: The thing we went to vegas in the first place for.
[08/12/2008 02:50:06 PM] Leah Shanker: But you really wouldn't know anything about that.
[08/12/2008 02:50:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaa, i saw all the stuff i wanted to
[08/12/2008 02:50:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i saw the most important and most interesting talks
[08/12/2008 02:51:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what if i wasn't up at 10 am, i had a great time and felt like i got my monies worth
[08/12/2008 02:51:49 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey, I'm just saying were into different things. I went to DEFCON for networking purposes and knowledge.
[08/12/2008 02:51:52 PM] Leah Shanker: You went for parties.
[08/12/2008 02:52:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am just saying you are wrong about that
[08/12/2008 02:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i went for both
[08/12/2008 02:52:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i learned a lot
[08/12/2008 02:52:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: and had a great time at the parties
[08/12/2008 02:53:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't assume you know about my experience when we barely even talked the whole trip
[08/12/2008 02:53:37 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm just telling it like I saw.
[08/12/2008 02:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't mind the awkwardness, i try to make the best of it, and maybe even get people involved, it was a once in a lifetime experience, and i made the most of it
[08/12/2008 02:55:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: more specifically to the strippers, crystal and mel didn't mind them at all, crystal even put dollars on them, when else would she have the chance to do that?
[08/12/2008 02:55:33 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, so I hear.
[08/12/2008 02:55:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying it isn't naughty or gross or awkward, all i am saying is there are ways around the awkwardness, and that is usually to "just go with it"
[08/12/2008 02:56:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey, I made the most of it. I met a couple professionals who can probably land me a job and also got Dark Tangent into the party next door.
[08/12/2008 02:57:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Which in turn meant I got to talk with him, which was great.
[08/12/2008 02:57:06 PM] Leah Shanker: All at this awkward party with the strippers.
[08/12/2008 02:57:33 PM] Leah Shanker: So I made the most of it, I'm just saying I don't prefer parties like that in the very least.
[08/12/2008 02:57:46 PM] Leah Shanker: In fact, they're the least fun.
[08/12/2008 02:58:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: well as long as you made the most of it, if i left when you did and didn't dance as much, i would have felt like i missed out
[08/12/2008 02:58:42 PM] Leah Shanker: We ducked out at nearly 2 am.
[08/12/2008 02:58:48 PM] Leah Shanker: That's not taking off early.
[08/12/2008 02:59:07 PM] Leah Shanker: It's enough to experience the party and mingle without sleeping through the first round of talks in the morning.
[08/12/2008 03:02:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got to talk to jackalobe before she went on, me and her are tight
[08/12/2008 03:03:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I saw pictures. She seems pretty friendly, we talked to her a bit on Sunday.

[08/14/2008 12:26:11 PM] Leah Shanker: you guys are cute together :)
[08/14/2008 12:26:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: just miss her, that's all

[08/14/2008 12:26:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: are we going to partay!?
[08/14/2008 12:26:52 PM] Leah Shanker: YES!
[08/14/2008 12:26:59 PM] Leah Shanker: but perhaps with a little less liver damage this time :)
[08/14/2008 12:27:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: I agree
[08/14/2008 12:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: infact i'd like to have a party next saturday as well before school, but the theme will be no alcohol
[08/14/2008 12:27:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought it was an interesting idea
[08/14/2008 12:28:04 PM] Leah Shanker: oooh
[08/14/2008 12:28:40 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm down for social experimentation
[08/14/2008 12:30:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm afraid to ask, but
[08/14/2008 12:30:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we will all have to think positively about the upcoming semester and the aura of our positive energy will make it so
[08/14/2008 12:31:05 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[08/14/2008 12:31:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can ask me anything
[08/14/2008 12:31:14 PM] Leah Shanker: what...what will we do?
[08/14/2008 12:31:21 PM] Leah Shanker: A Brian party sans alkie?
[08/14/2008 12:31:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm you pose and interesting point
[08/14/2008 12:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do sober people do at brian's party
[08/14/2008 12:31:49 PM] Leah Shanker: complain, lol
[08/14/2008 12:32:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: other then find some other way of being mischievous i suppose
[08/14/2008 12:32:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i will have to come up with something creative
[08/14/2008 12:32:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: arts and crafts night! wooo
[08/14/2008 12:32:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: j/k
[08/14/2008 12:32:26 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[08/14/2008 12:32:36 PM] Leah Shanker: I've been to parties without alcohol, and they are still pretty fun
[08/14/2008 12:32:44 PM] Leah Shanker: but a party at *your place*
[08/14/2008 12:32:47 PM] Leah Shanker: without alcohol
[08/14/2008 12:32:50 PM] Leah Shanker: would be a mind trip :)
[08/14/2008 12:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha, we can hope
[08/14/2008 12:33:36 PM] Leah Shanker: lan party?
[08/14/2008 12:33:46 PM] Leah Shanker: we havent done any gaming together in a long while
[08/14/2008 12:33:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i was just thinking the same thing
[08/14/2008 12:34:00 PM] Leah Shanker: armagetron!
[08/14/2008 12:34:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: woooo
[08/14/2008 12:34:23 PM] Leah Shanker: and civ4 and starcraft
[08/14/2008 12:34:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was just thinking how sweet it would be to write a program that would log in and out of games and spectate during a lan party
[08/14/2008 12:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: to put on a projector
[08/14/2008 12:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean if it wasn't being used of course
[08/14/2008 12:35:01 PM] Leah Shanker: heh
[08/14/2008 12:35:16 PM] Leah Shanker: that would be a tough problem
[08/14/2008 12:35:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could totally be done with a series of semi intelligent keyboard and mouse commands
[08/14/2008 12:35:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, or an expensive kvm switch
[08/14/2008 12:37:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, i am poor so thats not an option, but i think i can do it if i figure out the API commands for sending windows keyboard and mouse input in the program
[08/14/2008 12:37:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are programs that do it
[08/14/2008 12:38:06 PM] Leah Shanker: but also not interrupting the original display?
[08/14/2008 12:38:09 PM] Leah Shanker: that's the tricky part
[08/14/2008 12:38:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and ollydebug can hax api commands
[08/14/2008 12:39:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://send-key.qarchive.org/)http://send-key.qarchive.org/(Link: http://send-key.qarchive.org/)
[08/14/2008 12:45:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and done, now i have the source for handling windows API mouse click and send key functions
[08/14/2008 01:14:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Aw you need to have more fun :)
[08/14/2008 01:14:43 PM] Leah Shanker: In all of these pictures you look so miserable!
[08/14/2008 01:14:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[08/14/2008 01:36:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you ever have morning sex?
[08/14/2008 01:37:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think during the day is the best time to do it, you can see more. especially if the participants are young and beautiful
[08/14/2008 01:37:55 PM] Leah Shanker: I completely agree, but Matt isn't really a morning sex type guy.
[08/14/2008 01:38:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: in the words of bill danoff "why wait until the middle of a cold dark night"
[08/14/2008 01:38:22 PM] Leah Shanker: He gets all "aw, but my breath stinks and I'm all tired"
[08/14/2008 01:38:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it's understandable, you feel a little groggy after waking up and still haven't brushed teeth
[08/14/2008 01:38:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2008 01:38:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe "after shower sex"
[08/14/2008 01:39:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be awesome
[08/14/2008 01:39:11 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, that would be perfect
[08/14/2008 01:46:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you like the circus?
[08/14/2008 01:47:37 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, its fun
[08/14/2008 01:47:57 PM] Leah Shanker: I saw cirque du soleil about a year ago, absolutely blew my mind.
[08/14/2008 01:48:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about cirque du soleil?
[08/14/2008 01:48:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i've seen 3, and i love them all
[08/14/2008 01:48:19 PM] Leah Shanker: Definitely
[08/14/2008 01:48:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just got an e-mail from the club saying they are coming to phoenix with saltimbanco
[08/14/2008 01:49:21 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh cool
[08/14/2008 01:49:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry prescott valley, not phoenix
[08/14/2008 01:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i still might go
[08/14/2008 01:49:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Neat.
[08/14/2008 01:49:49 PM] Leah Shanker: The cirque's in vegas are great
[08/14/2008 01:50:08 PM] Leah Shanker: I saw a documentary on them - they build the stage from the ground up solely for that particular show
[08/14/2008 01:50:31 PM] Leah Shanker: I saw the Beatles LOVE Cirque and it was like sensory overload.
[08/14/2008 01:51:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah they are also 150 bucks usually
[08/14/2008 01:52:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, but they're worth it. I've never experienced anything else like it.
[08/14/2008 01:53:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah the ones in vegas have permanent stages, so they are even more incredible then the traveling ones.

[08/14/2008 03:04:49 PM] Leah Shanker: only problem is - our condo is in kind of the ghetto
[08/14/2008 03:05:07 PM] Leah Shanker: and Matt & I tend to have ultra modern (read: expensive) taste.
[08/14/2008 03:05:27 PM] Leah Shanker: And ultra modern upgrades are a terrible idea - no way we'll get our money's worth when we sell the place
[08/14/2008 03:06:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could do it yourself
[08/14/2008 03:06:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: lay the tiles and stuff
[08/14/2008 03:06:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh yeah, that's what we do.
[08/14/2008 03:06:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: tiling isn't too hard
[08/14/2008 03:06:37 PM] Leah Shanker: sawing tile is pretty hard
[08/14/2008 03:06:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess materials is the most expensive
[08/14/2008 03:06:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: not if you have a miter saw
[08/14/2008 03:06:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: or a bench saw
[08/14/2008 03:07:28 PM] Leah Shanker: We've been thinking about tile for a long time. In the bathroom and the kitchen
[08/14/2008 03:07:43 PM] Leah Shanker: We'd probably just go with white tile or some other kind of muted color.
[08/14/2008 03:10:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2008 03:10:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want tile on my table
[08/14/2008 03:11:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: my mom has a table that has smaller white tiles with a finished wood border
[08/14/2008 03:12:02 PM] Leah Shanker: ooh, that will be nice
[08/14/2008 03:12:10 PM] Leah Shanker: plus you can take it with you
[08/14/2008 03:14:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2008 03:19:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: damnit, now i want to go and browse home depot for supplies
[08/14/2008 03:20:35 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm heading over there soon to pick up some wood stain, wanna go?
[08/14/2008 03:21:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes!

[08/14/2008 05:43:04 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, but we don't go out anymore.
[08/14/2008 05:43:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[08/14/2008 05:43:12 PM] Leah Shanker: we're sort of paying off debt
[08/14/2008 05:43:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[08/14/2008 05:43:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: lame
[08/14/2008 05:43:38 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, don't make it harder :)
[08/14/2008 05:43:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i'll just run over to fazollis
[08/14/2008 05:44:03 PM] Leah Shanker: I could make something for dinner?
[08/14/2008 05:44:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what do you eat all the time?
[08/14/2008 05:44:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: usually when i am cooking for a meal, i end up spending way more!
[08/14/2008 05:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: granted i have left overs, but still
[08/14/2008 05:44:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, it's hard to spend more for two people though.
[08/14/2008 05:44:45 PM] Leah Shanker: like, say we go out to Os.
[08/14/2008 05:44:49 PM] Leah Shanker: its $30 for two people
[08/14/2008 05:45:04 PM] Leah Shanker: $30 gets you a fancy fuckin home cooked meal
[08/14/2008 05:45:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I can make something delicious if you're down
[08/14/2008 05:45:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[08/14/2008 05:46:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[08/14/2008 05:46:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like eating out
[08/14/2008 05:46:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: less effort
[08/14/2008 05:47:03 PM] Leah Shanker: you scorpios are supposed to be frugal :)
[08/14/2008 05:47:21 PM] Leah Shanker: but I suppose you're not paying for it ;)
[08/14/2008 05:47:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, i come from a rich family
[08/14/2008 05:47:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/14/2008 05:47:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm the same way, I'm the first to admit I'm a spoiled brat.
[08/14/2008 05:48:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Buuuuut been thinking about babies lately and nest eggs and happy nice homes in cookie cutter subdivisions
[08/14/2008 05:48:54 PM] Leah Shanker: And it seems that $20,000 of debt doesn't help me feel secure.
[08/14/2008 05:49:15 PM] Leah Shanker: Mind you, most of it is Matt's student loans, but still. Can't owe the man anything.
[08/14/2008 05:50:12 PM] Leah Shanker: You're not so bad though.
[08/14/2008 05:50:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Abe is the friend we kind of have to avoid.
[08/14/2008 05:50:48 PM] Leah Shanker: He goes out for every single meal.
[08/14/2008 05:51:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I love cooking.
[08/14/2008 05:51:47 PM] Leah Shanker: The smells and the anticipation and the feelings of herbs in my hands.
[08/14/2008 05:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah being in debt sucks
[08/14/2008 05:52:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe we should cook tomorrow
[08/14/2008 05:52:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i still have lots of canned tomatoes
[08/14/2008 05:53:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure, I'm down.
[08/14/2008 05:54:04 PM] Leah Shanker: I'd be happy to cook for the party if you wanna make it a dinner party
[08/14/2008 05:54:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Gimme a number and I'll be happy to make something delicious.
[08/14/2008 05:57:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: a price number?
[08/14/2008 05:57:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: or a people number?
[08/14/2008 05:57:49 PM] Leah Shanker: people
[08/14/2008 05:58:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe 6 people, lets spend 40 dollars
[08/14/2008 05:58:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have lots of snacks already
[08/14/2008 05:58:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll pay for the food obviously
[08/14/2008 05:58:37 PM] Leah Shanker: do we have vegetarians?
[08/14/2008 05:58:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and something with meat would be nice
[08/14/2008 05:58:53 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, my thoughts exactly
[08/14/2008 05:59:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: so possibly a dish that can be constructed for either
[08/14/2008 05:59:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about chicken parm?
[08/14/2008 05:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: home cooked, we can bread it and grill it on a stove skillet
[08/14/2008 06:00:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: then possibly bake it with some extra cheese and sauce on top of the noodles in the oven
[08/14/2008 06:00:18 PM] Leah Shanker: mmmm, that sounds good
[08/14/2008 06:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will have a side salad and home made garlic bread
[08/14/2008 06:01:01 PM] Leah Shanker: nom nom nom
[08/14/2008 06:01:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good for tomorrow?
[08/14/2008 06:01:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i won't go to fazollis tonight
[08/14/2008 06:01:45 PM] Leah Shanker: absolutely
[08/14/2008 06:01:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: should fit within budget also
[08/14/2008 06:01:58 PM] Leah Shanker: oh for sure
[08/14/2008 06:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok tell Matt, Ryan, and Abe
[08/14/2008 06:02:18 PM] Leah Shanker: hm
[08/14/2008 06:02:22 PM] Leah Shanker: abe will be trouble
[08/14/2008 06:02:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: then it will be you me and crystal, possibly dave but i am sure there will be plenty for everyone
[08/14/2008 06:02:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: Abe doesn't like dinner parties?
[08/14/2008 06:02:55 PM] Leah Shanker: he doesn't eat meat, he's a vegetarian
[08/14/2008 06:03:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about pasta and cheese?
[08/14/2008 06:03:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure, I can make a mean pasta sauce.
[08/14/2008 06:03:48 PM] Leah Shanker: Hold on a sec, lemme look through my recipes.
[08/14/2008 06:04:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't forget the canned tomatoes

[08/14/2008 06:08:45 PM] Leah Shanker: I can make the meat balls separate
[08/14/2008 06:08:53 PM] Leah Shanker: since the rest of us really love our meat
[08/14/2008 06:09:06 PM] Leah Shanker: and we can use up the tomatoes I made you buy :_
[08/14/2008 06:09:07 PM] Leah Shanker: :)

[08/14/2008 06:12:28 PM] Leah Shanker: actually, nm, we can just do it tomorrow
[08/14/2008 06:21:22 PM] Leah Shanker: eh, I'm just going to not invite abe :)

[09/06/2008 01:16:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes way?
[09/06/2008 01:17:09 PM] Leah Shanker: I swear to God, it's like every hairdresser I ever meet is married to a CS guy
[09/06/2008 01:17:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so why aren't there more girls?
[09/06/2008 01:17:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because they don't understand what CS is?
[09/06/2008 01:18:10 PM] Leah Shanker: CS guys are the real deal, once you're finished with guys who treat you like assholes you upgrade to CS guys in the end
[09/06/2008 01:18:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha yeah
[09/06/2008 01:18:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but what you said about me
[09/06/2008 01:18:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tried to play it off like you were wrong
[09/06/2008 01:18:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't think you are wrong
[09/06/2008 01:18:46 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm really sorry about that btw
[09/06/2008 01:18:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i over project myself to try and get attention
[09/06/2008 01:18:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I forget that guys don't like to talk about that stuff in public
[09/06/2008 01:19:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah dave was really embarrassed
[09/06/2008 01:19:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could tell
[09/06/2008 01:19:44 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I saw that and tried to sort of change the subject.
[09/06/2008 01:20:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really don't know any other way to be confident other then pretending, when it comes down to it, i can't talk to anyone (girls or guys) that i don't know really well
[09/06/2008 01:21:03 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't think that's true
[09/06/2008 01:21:15 PM] Leah Shanker: I think you're extremely initially social.
[09/06/2008 01:21:38 PM] Leah Shanker: Way moreso than I am, anyway.
[09/06/2008 01:23:46 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, there are things about you that impress me very much and they typically aren't the things you brag about.
[09/06/2008 01:26:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[09/06/2008 01:27:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tend to brag about stuff that i want to do, like expensive ventures and luxuries, but i actually never persue them.  If i really thought i had a lot of money from dad, i would buy hard drives so much more often.  But i try not to take advantage even though i sometimes talk about it.
[09/06/2008 01:29:45 PM] Leah Shanker: You're shooting yourself in the foot when you brag about that.
[09/06/2008 01:30:20 PM] Leah Shanker: If you were a self-made millionaire, you would *totally* have bragging rights to all the expensive toys you own and play with.
[09/06/2008 01:31:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/06/2008 01:31:51 PM] Leah Shanker: But if you're father is generous with you, it's definitely counter-productive to brag that you take advantage even if you don't.
[09/06/2008 01:32:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i brag about things i want to do, not really the financial backing, people who know me always assume that i am spoiled by daddy and thats where i would get the money to do it.
[09/06/2008 01:33:40 PM] Leah Shanker: That's cheating, you can't pre-emptively brag.
[09/06/2008 01:33:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[09/06/2008 01:34:08 PM] Leah Shanker: You can talk about your ideas and methods for executing a business plan.
[09/06/2008 01:34:22 PM] Leah Shanker: But no way do you get bragging rights until you're successful
[09/06/2008 01:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't really mean that kind of future success
[09/06/2008 01:36:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i am saying is people assume too much
[09/06/2008 01:36:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: my friends think i'm spoiled but i am more cautious with money then i let on
[09/06/2008 01:37:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i always have a plan of putting money back on dads account, i just take loans when paying for parties
[09/06/2008 01:37:47 PM] Leah Shanker: People never assume that you're lying about yourself.
[09/06/2008 01:38:07 PM] Leah Shanker: And that's probably the reason your donation bin is always empty!
[09/06/2008 01:38:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: or when i go out to eat and pay for the table i say "meh, dad can pay for dinner", i generally pay it back
[09/06/2008 01:40:24 PM] Leah Shanker: I know you're a good person, but you need to match your image to who you really are.
[09/06/2008 01:40:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just assumed it was empty because half the people brought something with them, and the other half are poor college kids like me
[09/06/2008 01:41:06 PM] Leah Shanker: nah, people assume your dad pays for everything so they don't hear your sob story.
[09/06/2008 01:42:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i try to not be stingy, keifer and joanna are and it drives me nuts, i want people to see that i am giving too and put effort and money into parties just to enjoy their company
[09/06/2008 01:42:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: but like you said, people assume my dad pays for everything
[09/06/2008 01:46:49 PM] Leah Shanker: I completely agree with you. Being stingy sort of drains you.
[09/06/2008 01:47:35 PM] Leah Shanker: I really don't mind cutting back in hard economic times, but it would be impossible for me to keep it up for a long period of time without becoming bitter.
[09/06/2008 01:48:06 PM] Leah Shanker: But then, I can also see it from their side too.
[09/06/2008 01:48:24 PM] Leah Shanker: The whole idea is that we get together as friends and have a great time.
[09/06/2008 01:49:23 PM] Leah Shanker: If we can do that without spending a ton of money, we've still had fun.
[09/06/2008 01:51:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: the Ice party is the only one i am doing this semester
[09/06/2008 01:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=72897770623)http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=72897770623

[09/06/2008 02:00:35 PM] Leah Shanker: It's like...oh I see because it's baby blue. That's kind of ice-y.
[09/06/2008 02:01:33 PM] Leah Shanker: There's like a standard "sexy" outfit they just dye different colors to be whatever other fairy tale princess.
[09/06/2008 02:01:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/06/2008 02:02:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: it looks like just a retailer, not necissarily all coming from the same place

[09/09/2008 04:49:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, that was unnessicary...
[09/09/2008 04:49:52 PM] Leah Shanker: what was?
[09/09/2008 04:49:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i ruined my chance to be cool
[09/09/2008 04:50:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course i would have given him the hard drive if i just had it laying around
[09/09/2008 04:50:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to need it in a few months for my new raid array
[09/09/2008 04:50:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just not using it right now
[09/09/2008 04:50:50 PM] Leah Shanker: his message was asking if anyone had any hds laying around...
[09/09/2008 04:50:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i would have to replace it down the line
[09/09/2008 04:51:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i must have missed the lying around part
[09/09/2008 04:51:49 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, I'm just saying he was fishing when he wanted to pay you for it
[09/09/2008 04:52:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it's a 500 gig, not an awkward size like 320 that you can't really make a useful raid with
[09/09/2008 04:52:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok I get it - but you shouldn't have offered it then.
[09/09/2008 04:52:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: 500 is significantly bigger, i offered 50 or 60 because that's what it might cost 3 months from now when i have to replace it, i would have been doing him a 3 month long favor
[09/09/2008 04:53:43 PM] Leah Shanker: He only needed it right now because his hd gave out - he's already ordered a new one on newegg.
[09/09/2008 04:54:04 PM] Leah Shanker: This group does favors for friends, that's all.
[09/09/2008 04:54:16 PM] Leah Shanker: And it's no secret you two aren't the best of friends.
[09/09/2008 04:54:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, see if he had explained to me that he could return it after he got a new one, i would definitely have given it to him
[09/09/2008 04:55:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: my point it, i am not using it right now so i could spare it, but i would eventually have to replace it, that's why i couldn't give it away for free
[09/09/2008 04:55:37 PM] Leah Shanker: You make your point - I'm just saying you could have been cool to make a friend.
[09/09/2008 04:55:48 PM] Leah Shanker: or you know, a better friend.
[09/09/2008 04:56:13 PM] Leah Shanker: I always feel weird selling my friends things and I get that's not weird for you.
[09/09/2008 04:57:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: not when it comes to hard drives, you know what a data whore i am, a 500 gig drive is like pure gold to me
[09/09/2008 04:57:39 PM] Leah Shanker: What is $50 to you?
[09/09/2008 04:57:52 PM] Leah Shanker: less than pure gold I would imagine
[09/09/2008 04:58:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: currently, it is half the price of a new raid array
[09/09/2008 04:59:06 PM] Leah Shanker: So if you had offered it to him, it would have been an even larger gesture of friendship.
[09/09/2008 04:59:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Since it means so much to you.
[09/09/2008 04:59:22 PM] Leah Shanker: I wouldn't give away trash to my friends...
[09/09/2008 04:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: well of course not
[09/09/2008 04:59:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Here, have my candy wrapper. You're a great friend.
[09/09/2008 04:59:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there is a difference between a hard drive lying around and gold
[09/09/2008 05:00:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need the space for movies, had he explained that he had a crash, i would have given it to him, i know how much it sucks for something to crash and have to wait on shipping to fix it
[09/09/2008 05:01:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but all the txt said was any decent sized drive, and i'd be willing to pay for it
[09/09/2008 05:02:15 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, I get it. You're not a giving person. I was just trying to help you.
[09/09/2008 05:03:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are intitled to your opinion, i'd be more then happy to buy him a drink, or throw a party for him, but w/e

[09/09/2008 05:38:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I was being deliberately harsh with you because that seems to be the only way to get your attention.
[09/09/2008 05:38:38 PM] Leah Shanker: You're right, you do give a lot to your parties you hold at your house.
[09/09/2008 05:38:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: well jeese, i am not retarded.
[09/09/2008 05:39:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: since Ryan is a better friend, i assume he had the oppotunity to inquire as to why Matt needed a hard drive.
[09/09/2008 05:39:44 PM] Leah Shanker: No, he found out afterwards.
[09/09/2008 05:40:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Ryan messaged "I have a 320gig", Matt asked how much, and Ryan gave it to him for free.
[09/09/2008 05:40:22 PM] Leah Shanker: then he told Ryan the story
[09/09/2008 05:41:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: Well, i don't know what to tell you, i guess i didn't have a spare hard drive, i had a temporarily not being used hard drive.
[09/09/2008 05:41:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I'm just saying: drinks are not the way to Matt's friendship.
[09/09/2008 05:42:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: Material things are?
[09/09/2008 05:42:24 PM] Leah Shanker: You're the only one that seems to care about material things here.
[09/09/2008 05:42:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Between friends, it's water.
[09/09/2008 05:43:24 PM] Leah Shanker: Making a friendly gesture that doesn't involve alcohol would do you very well.
[09/09/2008 05:43:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about hanging out?
[09/09/2008 05:43:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: remember when it used to be easy to make friends
[09/09/2008 05:43:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could just go to someone's how to play
[09/09/2008 05:44:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: or talk?
[09/09/2008 05:44:24 PM] Leah Shanker: We're talking about two different things here.
[09/09/2008 05:44:34 PM] Leah Shanker: There are acquaintances and there are friends.
[09/09/2008 05:44:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Friends are who you can count on when shit goes down.
[09/09/2008 05:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course
[09/09/2008 05:45:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: look, i am not going to try to defend myself against you, obviously you have it all figured out.
[09/09/2008 05:46:01 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm trying to get you to look at what your actions are saying.
[09/09/2008 05:46:14 PM] Leah Shanker: And if you change, that's great! But at least you know
[09/09/2008 05:46:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are saying i don't give away stuff that i am using
[09/09/2008 05:46:43 PM] Leah Shanker: They are saying to Matt "You can't count on me when shit goes down"
[09/09/2008 05:47:01 PM] Leah Shanker: So of course he wouldn't want to get close to you.
[09/09/2008 05:47:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i didn't want to give away a hard drive?
[09/09/2008 05:47:17 PM] Leah Shanker: You were ready to sell it for $50 to him.
[09/09/2008 05:47:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: do we actually know if ryan did have a hard drive lying around?
[09/09/2008 05:47:57 PM] Leah Shanker: No I have no idea.
[09/09/2008 05:48:09 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm just saying there is a difference here.
[09/09/2008 05:48:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt knows he can count on Ryan when shit goes down, so Ryan is a close friend.
[09/09/2008 05:50:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: the difference here is, ryan's drive probably was laying around in some box that wasn't set up, the hard drive i was ready to sell is running in my server right now ready to my formatted.
[09/09/2008 05:50:18 PM] Leah Shanker: It was his back-up drive.
[09/09/2008 05:50:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Had his Time Machine data on it
[09/09/2008 05:50:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if we are talking back up drives, i got a 160 external he can have
[09/09/2008 05:51:15 PM] Leah Shanker: He doesn't need it now. 
[09/09/2008 05:51:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Try to see my point here.
[09/09/2008 05:51:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i understand your point
[09/09/2008 05:52:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my point is a 500 GB drive is worth a lot more to me then a 320 GB drive.
[09/09/2008 05:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i had a 320 in a raid then i too would have given it to him
[09/09/2008 05:52:59 PM] Leah Shanker: You are being petty now.
[09/09/2008 05:53:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but he expressed no need, for all i know he could have just wanted it to expand his myth box storage
[09/09/2008 05:53:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: see you have a completely different view of the situation
[09/09/2008 05:53:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that's why this conversation is so irritating
[09/09/2008 05:53:37 PM] Leah Shanker: He wouldn't have called upon his friends for an extra mythbox storage
[09/09/2008 05:53:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: because you knew from the start that matt was in a bind
[09/09/2008 05:54:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if we were really friends (according to you) then i would have known that
[09/09/2008 05:54:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: but since you knew that he was in a bind, you are attacking me because i didn't come to his rescue
[09/09/2008 05:55:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i had something crash, that would have warrented a phone call, probably to joe first, and he would have given me a drive
[09/09/2008 05:55:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but like i said, for all i know, when he said "willing to pay for it" i assumed he just wanted a place to store stuff
[09/09/2008 05:55:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is much different then a system crash
[09/09/2008 05:56:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: so please, don't assume that, just because i didn't play white knight, that i won't go to great lengths to be matts friends
[09/09/2008 05:57:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was a lack of communication, and you are biased about it because you were there.
[09/09/2008 05:57:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: *matt's friend
[09/09/2008 05:59:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: do we understand each other?
[09/09/2008 06:04:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I get your reasoning. Just trying to get you to think about it.
[09/09/2008 06:06:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: You made it sound like i was willfully trying to sabatage my relationship with him, we are not closes enough friends for me to know these things.  I always assume hard drives are for storage, not for running OSes.
[09/09/2008 06:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: *close enough

[09/22/2008 03:25:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: can it wait 20 minutes?
[09/22/2008 03:25:58 PM] Leah Shanker: well, I was just wondering if they were handy
[09/22/2008 03:26:05 PM] Leah Shanker: if they're no, I'll just take some with my phone

[09/23/2008 01:49:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: i thought those girls were more annoying than ryan
[09/23/2008 01:50:02 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, it seems as though travis' sister likes to pick fights
[09/23/2008 01:50:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like she is very out spoken
[09/23/2008 01:50:33 AM] Leah Shanker: Or when someone is wrong, she's not content with allowing them to save face.
[09/23/2008 01:50:54 AM] Leah Shanker: It seems to me like a defense mechanism
[09/23/2008 01:50:59 AM] Leah Shanker: It's probably how she deals
[09/23/2008 01:51:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, it is weird, i know she is nice, but there is something about her....
[09/23/2008 01:52:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: almost condescending
[09/23/2008 01:52:24 AM] Leah Shanker: Yup, I agree. I wouldn't be able to get along with her.
[09/23/2008 01:52:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know she is gay right?
[09/23/2008 01:52:28 AM] Leah Shanker: But I understand why she's like that
[09/23/2008 01:52:35 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, that's why I said it was a defense.
[09/23/2008 01:52:40 AM] Leah Shanker: She probably gets a ton of flack for it.
[09/23/2008 01:53:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but she totally plays into some of it, it probably still bothers her somewhere down deep
[09/23/2008 01:53:31 AM] Leah Shanker: I think it would bother anyone to a certain extent.
[09/23/2008 01:54:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: and jessi is just a typical youngin, Elyse is sweet, she acts like she never has to prove anything, i think it is because she is in a long term relationship
[09/23/2008 01:54:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: but man, they talked twice as much as anyone else there
[09/23/2008 01:54:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: even during the dialog, i feel like i have no idea what happened, like i missed a lot
[09/23/2008 01:55:08 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah. I'm going to have to rewatch all three with matt anyway
[09/23/2008 01:55:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah good call
[09/23/2008 01:56:17 AM] Leah Shanker: damn travis
[09/23/2008 01:56:27 AM] Leah Shanker: I am going to have to teach that boy some ettiquette.
[09/23/2008 01:56:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Seriously, the guy forgets his bag in my car
[09/23/2008 01:56:45 AM] Leah Shanker: and asks me to come drop it off at his house for him
[09/23/2008 01:56:48 AM] Leah Shanker: like, wtf.
[09/23/2008 01:56:51 AM] Leah Shanker: come get your shit.
[09/23/2008 01:57:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: Yeah, you forgot your lip gloss weeks again. But i totally agree, i've never met someone more forgetful when it comes to his own stuff.
[09/23/2008 01:57:31 AM] Leah Shanker: It's not the forgetfulness.
[09/23/2008 01:57:37 AM] Leah Shanker: LIke you said, I forget shit all the time
[09/23/2008 01:57:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i know, i get what you are saying.
[09/23/2008 01:57:48 AM] Leah Shanker: but I'm not about to ask you to drive out to my place and drop off my lipgloss
[09/23/2008 01:58:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, did you tell him tomorrow morning?
[09/23/2008 01:58:10 AM] Leah Shanker: you can throw that out btw. I'm too afraid to use it again.
[09/23/2008 01:58:14 AM] Leah Shanker: yeah
[09/23/2008 01:58:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: good call
[09/23/2008 01:58:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: but it is especially sad because he doesn't realize when he is being a pain in the ass.
[09/23/2008 01:58:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg, you'd enjoy this.
[09/23/2008 02:01:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: everytime i feel shitty, or people feel shitty around him/me, for example with hangovers.  He has this uncanny ability to be more annoying.  He reminds me so much of a child in these situations.  He will walk around sleaping/passed out people and just make noise here and there.  Pack stuff away, crinkle bags of stuff excessively, just hang around and touch anything that interests him.  It seems like he wants people to wake up so that he has someone to play with.
[09/23/2008 02:01:59 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[09/23/2008 02:03:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: It is very strange, like he wants to bother people just to get a reaction because he is bored without us.  Like in Vegas when we were all fucked up he was up at 9 and the phone rings, instead of stepping out or into another room he sits on the bed around sleeping people for 5 minutes having a ridiculous conversation about where to meet.  I woke up and angrily and sarcastically tell him "Why don't you talk louder next time?" So instead of just brushing it off, he literally yells "OK, i'll try to talk louder"
[09/23/2008 02:03:56 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I can't tell you how many times he asked for a door code.
[09/23/2008 02:04:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: He doesn't realize he bothers people, so i try to let it go.
[09/23/2008 02:04:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: *bothers i mean pesters
[09/23/2008 02:04:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: *like a kid
[09/23/2008 02:04:44 AM] Leah Shanker: He didn't submit his form with the rest of our group. It was his own fault - and he literally bugs me every hour with phone calls and naggings "oh hey, I tried to get in the Acm Room and couldn't"
[09/23/2008 02:04:52 AM] Leah Shanker: he came up with ridiculously annoying ways of announcing it
[09/23/2008 02:04:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: he needs some tough love, you always said you get motherly defensive for him
[09/23/2008 02:05:04 AM] Leah Shanker: It's like - TRAVIS THIS IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON MY LIST OK
[09/23/2008 02:05:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i know how that feels
[09/23/2008 02:05:24 AM] Leah Shanker: Christ, kid. get a hobby.
[09/23/2008 02:05:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: man the days i spent sitting next to him after pulling and all nighter, it was horrible
[09/23/2008 02:05:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: "Get a hobby" i like that
[09/23/2008 02:06:50 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, my motherly defense for him went away when he started to be obnoxious.
[09/23/2008 02:07:11 AM] Leah Shanker: Though it still makes me cringe when you tease him out of nowhere.
[09/23/2008 02:07:19 AM] Leah Shanker: You should wait until he deserves it.
[09/23/2008 02:07:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol, i swear to god it goes both ways.
[09/23/2008 02:07:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: you know i can't rely on him for anything when it comes to school
[09/23/2008 02:08:05 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I can't rely on him for any of his officer duties either.
[09/23/2008 02:08:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: sure he is there to study with, but if i missed writing down an assignment, or some arbitrary instruction, he will bullshit me until the cows come home, just for kicks
[09/23/2008 02:08:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have to coax a straight answer out of him
[09/23/2008 02:09:09 AM] Leah Shanker: It's because you and him have a competitive friendship.
[09/23/2008 02:09:15 AM] Leah Shanker: Or so I notice anyway.
[09/23/2008 02:09:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: like when david smith will give you a stupid obvious answer, travis will keep going for hours
[09/23/2008 02:09:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: we are competitive yes
[09/23/2008 02:09:53 AM] Leah Shanker: He doesn't want to help you because he wants to be better than you.
[09/23/2008 02:10:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: but sometimes i am in serious need of help, and he just likes to torment me
[09/23/2008 02:10:11 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I know. It shouldn't have to be like that.
[09/23/2008 02:10:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i try to get him back, but it always happens to be infront of you
[09/23/2008 02:11:05 AM] Leah Shanker: You should break the cycle :)
[09/23/2008 02:11:19 AM] Leah Shanker: If you're always trying to get back at each other, then you're failing to help each other
[09/23/2008 02:11:23 AM] Leah Shanker: be the bigger man :)
[09/23/2008 02:11:35 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm saying this even though I am fully aware of how annoying he is.
[09/23/2008 02:11:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha, it's a self perpetuating machine by now, the cycle is like a nuclear reaction
[09/23/2008 02:17:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: crystal and I have a book of questions that we ask things out of.
[09/23/2008 02:18:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: and whenever we go out to like a party the first one to complement when the clock hits 1024 wins, just because it is a factor of 2, and because it is fun.
[09/23/2008 02:18:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: a power of 2
[09/23/2008 02:18:58 AM] Leah Shanker: lol
[09/23/2008 02:19:16 AM] Leah Shanker: that's super cute
[09/23/2008 02:19:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: question books are fun, you should try it sometime, if conversation ever gets a little sparse.
[09/23/2008 02:20:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: like after date nights, we always like to talk just before going to bed
[09/23/2008 02:20:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: speaking of which
[09/23/2008 02:20:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: see you tomorrow!

[09/30/2008 12:32:05 PM] Leah Shanker: nope, that's a completely reasonable requirement.
[09/30/2008 12:32:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I made Matt throw out all his pictures of his ex-fiancee.
[09/30/2008 12:32:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: There are a few reasons i don't like it, mostly because it sometimes makes us all feel bad.
[09/30/2008 12:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: And it makes me sad because she chooses to talk to him instead of me.
[09/30/2008 12:33:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, it's sort of her guilty feeling she's trying to quell by talking to him I think.
[09/30/2008 12:33:32 PM] Leah Shanker: She can't really do that with you.
[09/30/2008 12:33:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: I think it is giving him some sense of hope that he can make our relationship fail, and it isn't helping anyone move on.
[09/30/2008 12:34:54 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I think what needs to happen is Steve needs to start being an asshole and telling her never to talk to him (probably won't happen)
[09/30/2008 12:35:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Or she needs some other way of reconciling her feelings.
[09/30/2008 12:35:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Maybe something like community service. maybe even just talking it out, etc.
[09/30/2008 12:36:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: I have told her everything about how i feel when she talks to him, and she still doesn't understand why she should stop.
[09/30/2008 12:37:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: I would never make her choose between our relationship and talking to him, it is way to frivolous for that.  But i asked her not to while we are apart because it is already hard enough and she still does it.
[09/30/2008 12:37:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I totally understand where you're coming from. I was in your exact situation too.
[09/30/2008 12:38:10 PM] Leah Shanker: You know, it may be good for her to talk to Matt.
[09/30/2008 12:38:45 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt is sort of a zealot for not hanging on to relationshits.
[09/30/2008 12:38:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: Hmmm.
[09/30/2008 12:39:14 PM] Leah Shanker: And in her case, it really does seem like she probably feels guilty - not that she wants to get bak with steve.
[09/30/2008 12:39:30 PM] Leah Shanker: back*
[09/30/2008 12:39:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yea, i don't know
[09/30/2008 12:40:20 PM] Leah Shanker: But I definitely hear you. If Matt was still talking to that girl, I would feel exactly like you do.
[09/30/2008 12:40:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, Matt was in Crystal's situation so maybe he can offer a better viewpoint.
[09/30/2008 12:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: Yeah.  But you two are married and have been together for years.
[09/30/2008 12:41:03 PM] Leah Shanker: But that goes for even if we were just starting to date.
[09/30/2008 12:41:48 PM] Leah Shanker: As soon as it becomes serious, I would say all rules about exes should go.
[09/30/2008 12:42:38 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, I know it's really hard to be in your situation.
[09/30/2008 12:42:46 PM] Leah Shanker: You have to balance trusting her completely with jealousy.
[09/30/2008 12:43:22 PM] Leah Shanker: It ate me up inside until he finally threw out the pictures of his own volition.
[09/30/2008 12:50:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: it eats me up inside
[09/30/2008 12:51:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: especially when i am completely available and she is talking to him and ignoring me
[09/30/2008 12:51:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and when she brings him up on the phone, i don't really feel like talking, i have nothing nice to say about him, so i don't say anything at all
[09/30/2008 12:53:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I know
[09/30/2008 12:53:57 PM] Leah Shanker: It's awful - I literally thought really violent thoughts about this other girl who was probably a very nice girl.
[09/30/2008 12:54:04 PM] Leah Shanker: It isn't about Steve.
[09/30/2008 12:54:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Crystal is talking to him for her own selfish reasons and in turn is alienating you.
[09/30/2008 12:54:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, i have thought that if steve kept trying to contact her and making her cry from his e-mails, i'd have to kick his ass
[09/30/2008 12:55:47 PM] Leah Shanker: So I know that it's easier on you to blame him.
[09/30/2008 12:56:21 PM] Leah Shanker: But it's not Steve's fault, really. And I don't think you'll be able to see that until this is all over with.
[09/30/2008 12:57:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Crystal is being selfish. Trying to reconcile her guilt by ruining her current happiness with you.
[09/30/2008 12:57:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i know. he hasn't really tried to contact her for a while
[09/30/2008 12:57:51 PM] Leah Shanker: Try and get her to do something she doesn't like doing, and tell her she's doing it to make amends for abandoning Steve.
[09/30/2008 12:58:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: he kind of sent her an e-mail with questions, and she sent replies, and i think that was his closure
[09/30/2008 12:58:01 PM] Leah Shanker: And it's important you're blunt and almost harsh with your words.
[09/30/2008 12:58:34 PM] Leah Shanker: Try like, going to church, volunteering at a battered woman's shelter, something like that.
[09/30/2008 12:59:28 PM] Leah Shanker: That way she can lean on some other punishment than subjecting herself to Steve and ruining what she's got going with you.
[09/30/2008 01:00:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Trust me, it sounds really harsh, but it will help her get the same feeling from something that won't hurt your emotional bonds.
[09/30/2008 01:01:42 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, if it makes you feel any better, I'm totally neglecting Automata for this conversation.
[09/30/2008 01:08:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: automata sucks, i can help you with it later

[10/18/2008 07:18:23 PM] Leah Shanker: no, you would not be paid back.

[10/18/2008 07:20:40 PM] Leah Shanker: the blimp gets us recruitment points.
[10/18/2008 07:20:49 PM] Leah Shanker: plus it's paid for.
[10/18/2008 07:21:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: digital carnivals are required, have we picked out a date for the next one?
[10/18/2008 07:21:09 PM] Leah Shanker: the inventory idea - someone is going to spend a lot of their own time doing it
[10/18/2008 07:21:13 PM] Leah Shanker: without being paid.
[10/18/2008 07:21:20 PM] Leah Shanker: a very cool thing to do, but again not required.
[10/18/2008 07:21:26 PM] Leah Shanker: yes - nov. 15
[10/18/2008 07:21:31 PM] Leah Shanker: in cue thirty
[10/18/2008 07:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: time is one thing, paying actually monies for materials is another
[10/18/2008 07:23:48 PM] Leah Shanker: agreed. but acm doesn't need a pimped out recycle bin.
[10/18/2008 07:23:55 PM] Leah Shanker: if you can convince me otherwise, we'll revisit.
[10/18/2008 07:24:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if the ambassador's accept the cost of recycle bins maybe i can help make them up, it would be a shame to have such an awesome idea go to waste
[10/18/2008 07:25:03 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, if you're willing. and they're willing.

[10/23/2008 04:34:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: the thing that bugs me about Travis is he can't just do someone because someone asks him to.  He either has to have his own reasons or be given a bunch of reasons for him to "take into consideration".  Like the thing with the key, almost like he doesn't trust anyone else's opinion, he wouldn't give it up just because you asked like most people would, he won't make me an event admin to invite a few more people, and it is frustrating.

[10/31/2008 02:51:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[10/31/2008 02:51:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: unaccetable
[10/31/2008 02:51:06 PM] Leah Shanker: When it's a bunch of friends in an enclosed space without many clothes on, I forsee danger.
[10/31/2008 02:51:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: my place is like a club
[10/31/2008 02:51:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: but people you know
[10/31/2008 02:51:15 PM] Leah Shanker: no it's not.
[10/31/2008 02:51:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: what danger?
[10/31/2008 02:51:42 PM] Leah Shanker: there's no security guard to wave to when some guy is harassing me.
[10/31/2008 02:52:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: obviously a party of this caliber i would hire someone
[10/31/2008 02:52:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: there would be rules
[10/31/2008 02:52:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: at least
[10/31/2008 02:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the rooms would be guy or girl only
[10/31/2008 02:52:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: or there would be some place to escape to
[10/31/2008 02:53:25 PM] Leah Shanker: if you rented out a place, I would come.
[10/31/2008 02:53:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[10/31/2008 02:54:16 PM] Leah Shanker: it's ok though, i'm sure everyone else would come to a lingerie party if you threw it at your place.
[10/31/2008 02:54:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be more possible to happen at my place, renting is expensive, but i will take all of your concerns into consideration
[10/31/2008 02:54:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the private room would be a good idea
[10/31/2008 02:54:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: somewhere the girls could escape to
[10/31/2008 02:55:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: you hungry?
[10/31/2008 02:55:54 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, i could eat.
[10/31/2008 02:56:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you at home?
[10/31/2008 02:56:13 PM] Leah Shanker: yup, but my keys are in my bag :)
[10/31/2008 02:56:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: no extra car key?

[11/06/2008 10:24:08 AM] Leah Shanker: Making the posters should most certainly be a PR Director's job.
[11/06/2008 10:24:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: About what?
[11/06/2008 10:24:18 AM] Leah Shanker: That still doesn't get you out of it this semester.

[11/06/2008 10:24:34 AM] Leah Shanker: Just the category - it really is advertising.
[11/06/2008 10:24:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: well, if it is a PR job then i am going to need some more jobs to do.
[11/06/2008 10:24:46 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm going to mark it as something the PR Director will do next semester

[11/06/2008 10:28:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: And if you doubt i will get reelected, i could always argue that Bush got reelected :-P
[11/06/2008 10:28:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Bush actually ran the country as I remember :P
[11/06/2008 10:28:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: I actually don't care either way, just as long as it is what's best for ACM
[11/06/2008 10:29:14 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm just playing with you. If you get re-elected I will definitely expect you to perform your job duties.
[11/06/2008 10:32:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: Looks like the new macs fix all yours guys' chipping problems

[11/18/2008 10:47:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: how are you?
[11/18/2008 10:47:50 PM] Leah Shanker: doing ok, despite a bad couple of weeks.
[11/18/2008 10:47:57 PM] Leah Shanker: how are you doing?
[11/18/2008 10:48:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am falling apart
[11/18/2008 10:48:21 PM] Leah Shanker: what's wrong?
[11/18/2008 10:48:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: david wants to move out
[11/18/2008 10:48:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer and i had another falling out
[11/18/2008 10:48:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: for good reason this time
[11/18/2008 10:48:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think apologies will make it better
[11/18/2008 10:48:59 PM] Leah Shanker: wait, what happened?
[11/18/2008 10:49:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i miss crystal
[11/18/2008 10:49:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: it seems like i am losing friends
[11/18/2008 10:49:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: the worst part is, i've resorted to watching the lake house
[11/18/2008 10:49:38 PM] Leah Shanker: what happened?
[11/18/2008 10:50:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: long storry
[11/18/2008 10:50:32 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, you don't have to tell me.
[11/18/2008 10:50:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but to make it short, joanna made a snide comment about my dad, and i called her a bitch and keifer freaked out and kicked me out of his party
[11/18/2008 10:51:28 PM] Leah Shanker: His parties suck anyway.
[11/18/2008 10:51:34 PM] Leah Shanker: It's not like that was much of a blow.
[11/18/2008 10:52:23 PM] Leah Shanker: want me to bring over the latest grey's anatomy and some wine?
[11/18/2008 10:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: he kind of jumped me with getting angry, i was really hurt by joanna's comment, and i felt under appreciated, and she couldn't understand that
[11/18/2008 10:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to do compilers homework
[11/18/2008 10:53:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I hate to break this all down into astrology again
[11/18/2008 10:53:58 PM] Leah Shanker: my parents are both Geminis, so I understand this a lot.
[11/18/2008 10:54:15 PM] Leah Shanker: They tend to be really...obliviously hurtful with their words.
[11/18/2008 10:54:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah?
[11/18/2008 10:54:43 PM] Leah Shanker: They sort of think they're just making an observation.
[11/18/2008 10:54:56 PM] Leah Shanker: Even though their words are spoken with spite.
[11/18/2008 10:55:25 PM] Leah Shanker: It's something I've really had to get used to - and it's one of the reasons I can't really stand to be around my parents for long periods of time.
[11/18/2008 10:55:34 PM] Leah Shanker: I think it's the same way with Joanna.
[11/18/2008 10:55:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, joanna said "not everyone has a rich father like you" after they tried to collect money from people, but the way she said it kind of stung.  people don't understand the sacrifices i have made.
[11/18/2008 10:56:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't stand the way those two are stingy, i have a job that just barely pays for parties, i like to be around friends so i never mind spending the money
[11/18/2008 10:56:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer and joanna both have jobs but they spend money on going out to eat and paying for WoW and keifer just bought a new computer.
[11/18/2008 10:57:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, ok. You know what I'm going to tell you.
[11/18/2008 10:57:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not sure
[11/18/2008 10:57:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok
[11/18/2008 10:57:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are all poor college students, he forces people to drink and then expects people to pay him for it
[11/18/2008 10:58:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Even though you pay back your dad regularly for the money you borrow from him, you still tend to give off the image that it's "no big deal" that you're picking up the dinner tab.
[11/18/2008 10:58:31 PM] Leah Shanker: The reason they see you that way is because you project that image, regardless of whether it's true or not.
[11/18/2008 10:59:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i joke about him being rich because i am insecure. what i have told them before and what the also fail to be compassionate to is the relationship sacrifices that i have made because of his work ethics.
[11/18/2008 11:00:12 PM] Leah Shanker: I am in your exact same boat and I really do feel the same way.
[11/18/2008 11:00:25 PM] Leah Shanker: I have rich parents too and I pretty much grew up without a mommy.
[11/18/2008 11:00:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: joanna is completely unappreciative of what i give to be around friends
[11/18/2008 11:00:52 PM] Leah Shanker: It stems largely from jealousy.
[11/18/2008 11:01:22 PM] Leah Shanker: The thing is, people want what they don't have.
[11/18/2008 11:01:30 PM] Leah Shanker: They don't think about the consequences of having those things.
[11/18/2008 11:01:38 PM] Leah Shanker: You and I both grew up the same way.
[11/18/2008 11:01:45 PM] Leah Shanker: I would give up all the money in the world for a mommy.
[11/18/2008 11:01:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: me too
[11/18/2008 11:02:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways, joanna and keifer have an inability to be empathetic to other people's financial situations
[11/18/2008 11:02:43 PM] Leah Shanker: To jump to her defense - you do give off that image.
[11/18/2008 11:03:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Regardless of if it' true or not true - you can't blame her for thinking that way about you if you project it out of insecurity.
[11/18/2008 11:03:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are all poor college students, and the fact that he didn't understand how i felt, and jumped me because of what i said, it is evidence i can't be friends with him
[11/18/2008 11:03:36 PM] Leah Shanker: He jumped at you because you called Joanna a bitch.
[11/18/2008 11:03:52 PM] Leah Shanker: If Keifer called Crystal a bitch, you would do the same thing.
[11/18/2008 11:04:03 PM] Leah Shanker: regardless of whether it was true in the situation or not.
[11/18/2008 11:04:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Trust me, I'm no fan of Keifer.
[11/18/2008 11:04:24 PM] Leah Shanker: In the least.
[11/18/2008 11:04:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was waiting for someone to say that
[11/18/2008 11:04:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: just so i could say, i really can't relate because i've never dated a fucking idiot
[11/18/2008 11:05:46 PM] Leah Shanker: I get how you feel. And if you want to get something from this situation, you have to think about how you project yourself.
[11/18/2008 11:06:08 PM] Leah Shanker: You tell people you're a rich kid so you can seem like you're better than everyone else.
[11/18/2008 11:06:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't tell people that on purpose
[11/18/2008 11:07:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Maybe not, but now that you know what can happen, you should think twice before bragging about money.
[11/18/2008 11:07:44 PM] Leah Shanker: It's like...
[11/18/2008 11:07:58 PM] Leah Shanker: would you walk around downtown Mexico City flashing wads of cash?
[11/18/2008 11:08:17 PM] Leah Shanker: but kind of more subtle..
[11/18/2008 11:09:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: no but i am pretty sure that if i threw a party with my own money the attendees would still be more appreciative then some of these people
[11/18/2008 11:09:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok please don't get me started on that.
[11/18/2008 11:10:18 PM] Leah Shanker: With the group that you hang out with - I've had to purposefully tone down my general approach to spending money with them.
[11/18/2008 11:10:57 PM] Leah Shanker: When I'm around Abe, Ryan & Crew - I'm never afraid to just casually buy dinner or whatever because I know someday they'll get me back.
[11/18/2008 11:11:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: agreed
[11/18/2008 11:11:19 PM] Leah Shanker: I have never ever ever been paid back with your friends.
[11/18/2008 11:11:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope that i pay you back
[11/18/2008 11:12:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, so I agree with you.
[11/18/2008 11:12:19 PM] Leah Shanker: This particular friend culture is a bit different than normal.
[11/18/2008 11:12:28 PM] Leah Shanker: They sort of...always expect someone else to pay.
[11/18/2008 11:12:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess that it why i get so annoyed when people like keifer and joanna are extra stingy
[11/18/2008 11:13:00 PM] Leah Shanker: What makes you say they're stingy?
[11/18/2008 11:13:12 PM] Leah Shanker: They throw parties a lot. Buy booze, pizza, etc.
[11/18/2008 11:13:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: because they are always the ones to ask for money, and expect you to pay them back immediately
[11/18/2008 11:13:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i always contribute to parties and they still expect more
[11/18/2008 11:14:12 PM] Leah Shanker: It's draining
[11/18/2008 11:14:20 PM] Leah Shanker: because people like Travis don't ever contribute.
[11/18/2008 11:14:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer and joanna are a special brand of selfish
[11/18/2008 11:14:38 PM] Leah Shanker: They expect more from you because they know you care and you'll pick up the slack where others are lacking.
[11/18/2008 11:14:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: travis will if you pull his leg
[11/18/2008 11:14:51 PM] Leah Shanker: I shouldn't *have* to pull his leg!
[11/18/2008 11:14:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[11/18/2008 11:14:59 PM] Leah Shanker: Christ, it's common courtesy.
[11/18/2008 11:15:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i know right!?
[11/18/2008 11:15:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer and joanna always come and pick up wine and beer that they bring to my parties
[11/18/2008 11:15:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: even if there is like 3 beers or a half of a bottle of wine left
[11/18/2008 11:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: they will come pick it up whenever it is convenient for them
[11/18/2008 11:16:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes they don't even call before hand
[11/18/2008 11:16:25 PM] Leah Shanker: That's a little bit odd, but it's not really rude.
[11/18/2008 11:16:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it is
[11/18/2008 11:16:51 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean, they came, brought booze, shared and then brought whatever was left home.
[11/18/2008 11:17:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have never considered taking a handle home with me after a party
[11/18/2008 11:17:12 PM] Leah Shanker: No, it's not my style either.
[11/18/2008 11:17:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: especially not the next day or whenever i feel like it
[11/18/2008 11:17:22 PM] Leah Shanker: But at least they are not little Travises.
[11/18/2008 11:17:37 PM] Leah Shanker: I hate to pick on Travis, but he did this really manipulative thing to me in Sam's Club and now he's my target.
[11/18/2008 11:18:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't count the times keifer has said "yeah man, if you just pick up something this time i'll bring something next, or whatever" and then he doesn't
[11/18/2008 11:18:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: what did he do at sam's club?
[11/18/2008 11:19:14 PM] Leah Shanker: He announced that he wanted to buy a blush wine. Picked out like three, put it in the basket.
[11/18/2008 11:19:24 PM] Leah Shanker: And then made himself scarce at checkout.
[11/18/2008 11:19:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[11/18/2008 11:19:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Like, I don't even like blush wine.
[11/18/2008 11:19:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Not my cuppa tea at all.
[11/18/2008 11:20:11 PM] Leah Shanker: That's the first day I considered not bringing in all my alcohol to share.
[11/18/2008 11:20:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah keifer buys this cheap blush wine at safeway that comes in a gallon bottle, travis is so shallow when it comes to acquiring a taste for new things
[11/18/2008 11:20:36 PM] Leah Shanker: Where I felt I had to look out for myself amongst friends - never happened before.
[11/18/2008 11:20:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i had a day like that
[11/18/2008 11:20:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had to hide my bottle of grey goose and 99 bananas
[11/18/2008 11:21:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some mixers
[11/18/2008 11:21:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: they ended up finding the grey goose and drinking it anyways
[11/18/2008 11:21:27 PM] Leah Shanker: Christ.
[11/18/2008 11:21:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, this is not how friends behave.
[11/18/2008 11:22:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd like to buy you a drink sometime this week
[11/18/2008 11:23:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure, whenever.
[11/18/2008 11:23:53 PM] Leah Shanker: Wait, I think you inadvertently bought me a drink at green room.
[11/18/2008 11:24:04 PM] Leah Shanker: So I think I owe you a drink now, lol.
[11/18/2008 11:24:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what a friend would say.
[11/18/2008 11:24:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but actually, you gave your drink to Mel, so maybe i bought Mel a drink.
[11/18/2008 11:25:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh I owe Mel a bajillion drinks.
[11/18/2008 11:25:47 PM] Leah Shanker: I forgot to check out of green room because Matt was in a hurry to get to the movies
[11/18/2008 11:25:58 PM] Leah Shanker: so she faked my signature and got my card :)
[11/18/2008 11:25:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you get your card back?
[11/18/2008 11:26:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[11/18/2008 11:26:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice
[11/18/2008 11:26:19 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, it's been circulating my friend group all weekend, heh.
[11/18/2008 11:26:31 PM] Leah Shanker: So I bought a Turkey today!
[11/18/2008 11:26:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i heard!
[11/18/2008 11:26:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it exploded?
[11/18/2008 11:26:50 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, david...
[11/18/2008 11:27:23 PM] Leah Shanker: no, it was frozen in my trunk. And I ended up waiting around for like an hour for David to bring me my card.
[11/18/2008 11:27:32 PM] Leah Shanker: which is what made me late for the meeting.
[11/18/2008 11:27:39 PM] Leah Shanker: I didn't want it to thaw out.
[11/18/2008 11:27:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway - we should have a dinner party!
[11/18/2008 11:28:18 PM] Leah Shanker: That was fun last time, we should have more. Matt & I are really trying to save money by not going out to eat.
[11/18/2008 11:28:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah same here
[11/18/2008 11:28:32 PM] Leah Shanker: And even a delicious Turkey feast for 12 actually saves money over El Capitans.
[11/18/2008 11:28:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have eaten pasta 10 times in the last week
[11/18/2008 11:28:55 PM] Leah Shanker: But it gets so lonely at home! I miss being out with friends.
[11/18/2008 11:29:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[11/18/2008 11:29:05 PM] Leah Shanker: So a dinner party is a wonderful blend.
[11/18/2008 11:29:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to find a way to split up the leftovers
[11/18/2008 11:29:58 PM] Leah Shanker: Sure! I can bring tupperware and it can just circulate around or whatever.
[11/18/2008 11:30:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good
[11/18/2008 11:30:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: but only the people who pay for it can have leftovers
[11/18/2008 11:30:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am tired of sharing with david when he never pays or helps
[11/18/2008 11:30:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, what we can do
[11/18/2008 11:30:57 PM] Leah Shanker: is switch up the places for the dinner party.
[11/18/2008 11:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: that works too
[11/18/2008 11:31:13 PM] Leah Shanker: So if it's at my place, I can buy all the stuff and cook. Your place, same.
[11/18/2008 11:31:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: want to do it at your place? and i can buy since you bought last time
[11/18/2008 11:31:39 PM] Leah Shanker: It was your birthday! That doesn't count.
[11/18/2008 11:32:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: then we will start fresh and i will buy first to be chivalrous 
[11/18/2008 11:32:08 PM] Leah Shanker: But sure, my place is good. I'm guessing you don't have a Turkey Pan :P
[11/18/2008 11:32:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: what goes with turkey?
[11/18/2008 11:32:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: stuffing?
[11/18/2008 11:32:44 PM] Leah Shanker: Taters, cranberries, stuffing.
[11/18/2008 11:32:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: my moms infamous cheese potatoes
[11/18/2008 11:32:53 PM] Leah Shanker: I make a mean turkey pomegranate gravy.
[11/18/2008 11:32:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Yummy!
[11/18/2008 11:33:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Anything taters is always good.
[11/18/2008 11:33:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Friday?
[11/18/2008 11:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good to me
[11/18/2008 11:34:41 PM] Leah Shanker: cool
[11/18/2008 11:34:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: who should we invite?
[11/18/2008 11:34:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Hum, good question.
[11/18/2008 11:35:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Lemme create a facebook group and see who I can diberately exclude :P
[11/18/2008 11:35:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: we should be cautious in our decision
[11/18/2008 11:35:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good to me
[11/18/2008 11:35:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Lol if you come over to my place and write ACM all over my stuff I swear to god...
[11/18/2008 11:36:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: what?
[11/18/2008 11:36:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you saw that?
[11/18/2008 11:36:10 PM] Leah Shanker: That was quite funny, btw.
[11/18/2008 11:36:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: lawl
[11/18/2008 11:36:19 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt came back and he was all
[11/18/2008 11:36:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had lab before you got there
[11/18/2008 11:36:26 PM] Leah Shanker: "I don't think ACM would even want my PoS"
[11/18/2008 11:36:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: the objective was to point out stuff that had been sitting around for a while
[11/18/2008 11:36:54 PM] Leah Shanker: True, it's probably full of various humiliation and degredation of women porn.
[11/18/2008 11:37:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone left Dell Taco crap everywhere and i had to clean up
[11/18/2008 11:37:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, I got it. Funny funny ha ha.
[11/18/2008 11:37:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: the place was a mess when we kicked people out
[11/18/2008 11:37:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Seriously, what is WITH people!
[11/18/2008 11:37:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so now if something remains in the room in the same spot for a week i am writing acm
[11/18/2008 11:37:41 PM] Leah Shanker: It's like nobody ever taught them how to be in a place they don't live.
[11/18/2008 11:37:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[11/18/2008 11:37:48 PM] Leah Shanker: lol.
[11/18/2008 11:37:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they never taught them party manners
[11/18/2008 11:39:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was a wreck after keifer kicked me out, the worst part was he told me that everyone was appalled at me, and everyone hated me.  it turns out some of them were on my side about the financial issues, and some of them thought it was a reasonable response having heard about my life story with my dad.
[11/18/2008 11:39:45 PM] Leah Shanker: Fuck Keifer.
[11/18/2008 11:39:57 PM] Leah Shanker: Seriously, he's not worth your time or emotion.
[11/18/2008 11:40:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i have reached that conclusion
[11/18/2008 11:40:22 PM] Leah Shanker: He is one I am definitely not inviting to our turkeyfeast.
[11/18/2008 11:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i think we need to redress the cleanliness issue this week, we should do it every few weeks in the future in order to keep these children in line
[11/18/2008 11:41:57 PM] Leah Shanker: I agree.
[11/18/2008 11:43:29 PM] Leah Shanker: What's a good time for a feast? 6? 7?
[11/18/2008 11:43:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: 7
[11/18/2008 11:43:50 PM] Leah Shanker: kay
[11/18/2008 11:43:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: big meals should be later so people work up an appitite
[11/18/2008 11:44:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, the turkey's gonna take all day to cook, so later is better.
[11/18/2008 11:44:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have 1 oven?
[11/18/2008 11:45:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Yup
[11/18/2008 11:45:20 PM] Leah Shanker: But we can also add whatever you need for the taters
[11/18/2008 11:45:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to manage time well in order to get the cheese potatoes over to your place still hot
[11/18/2008 11:45:47 PM] Leah Shanker: you could cook them 3/4 of the way and then heat them here too
[11/18/2008 11:45:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Or you could cook them here.
[11/18/2008 11:46:50 PM] Leah Shanker: It's not a big turkey, it's only like a 10 lber.
[11/18/2008 11:47:04 PM] Leah Shanker: so it doesn't take up the entire oven
[11/18/2008 11:47:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[11/19/2008 12:00:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to watch Love Actually with Elyse tomorrow.
[11/19/2008 12:01:27 AM] Leah Shanker: cool
[11/19/2008 12:01:44 AM] Leah Shanker: So how is mcDave taking Katrina's engagement?
[11/19/2008 12:01:51 AM] Leah Shanker: Do you think he's ok?
[11/19/2008 12:02:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't speak to mcDave, haven't you seen his facebook status?
[11/19/2008 12:02:15 AM] Leah Shanker: no. is it ominous?
[11/19/2008 12:03:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: "Dave is looking for a new roommate for Brian"
[11/19/2008 12:04:08 AM] Leah Shanker: huh. how dramatic.
[11/19/2008 12:04:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah...
[11/19/2008 12:04:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: he wan't to move out
[11/19/2008 12:04:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: *wants
[11/19/2008 12:04:27 AM] Leah Shanker: why?
[11/19/2008 12:04:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: because he would rather run away from his problems then talk about it
[11/19/2008 12:04:58 AM] Leah Shanker: did you confront him on his self-esteem?
[11/19/2008 12:05:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: no
[11/19/2008 12:05:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: not recently
[11/19/2008 12:05:15 AM] Leah Shanker: oh ok. that didn't go well last time I tried.
[11/19/2008 12:05:18 AM] Leah Shanker: drunkenly.
[11/19/2008 12:05:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: its not you
[11/19/2008 12:05:41 AM] Leah Shanker: Is it Katrina?
[11/19/2008 12:05:52 AM] Leah Shanker: Or is it the mess/contribution thing with you?
[11/19/2008 12:05:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: he doesn't like it when i have people over late
[11/19/2008 12:06:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: it mentioned it once, and the next i heard about it was today when he told me he wanted to move out
[11/19/2008 12:06:28 AM] Leah Shanker: eh, it's your house.
[11/19/2008 12:06:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't need him either
[11/19/2008 12:30:09 AM] Leah Shanker: h'okay!
[11/19/2008 12:30:16 AM] Leah Shanker: say yes on facebook!
[11/19/2008 12:57:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did
[11/19/2008 12:57:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: wooo!
[11/19/2008 01:08:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to project an image of success, not wealth
[11/19/2008 01:09:25 AM] Leah Shanker: highly agreed.
[11/19/2008 01:09:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i am not sure how to do that
[11/19/2008 01:11:35 AM] Leah Shanker: be successful :)  then it comes naturally.
[11/19/2008 01:12:06 AM] Leah Shanker: and in order to be successful, you have to work hard - no shortcuts.
[11/19/2008 01:12:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: well obviously, but how do other people view success
[11/19/2008 01:14:48 AM] Leah Shanker: it's in attitude, I guess.
[11/19/2008 01:15:05 AM] Leah Shanker: Whether you're the best in what you do or not.
[11/19/2008 01:15:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have everything i need
[11/19/2008 01:15:38 AM] Leah Shanker: what's that?
[11/19/2008 01:15:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: parents who love me, friends that i enjoy, a beautiful girlfriend
[11/19/2008 01:16:22 AM] Leah Shanker: I suppose traditionally success is based on your work.
[11/19/2008 01:16:31 AM] Leah Shanker: Culturally.
[11/19/2008 01:16:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: i meant success in life
[11/19/2008 01:16:44 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah I know, but you asked me how to project an image of success.
[11/19/2008 01:17:05 AM] Leah Shanker: And I'm telling you that you need to be driven and motivated and the best at your job.
[11/19/2008 01:17:20 AM] Leah Shanker: Even though, in order to be truly successful, you need to be well-rounded.
[11/19/2008 01:17:31 AM] Leah Shanker: It's like the double-standard for women.
[11/19/2008 01:17:49 AM] Leah Shanker: Men want a wholesome, innocent mom-type woman as a wife
[11/19/2008 01:17:58 AM] Leah Shanker: who's a stripper in the bedroom.
[11/19/2008 01:18:06 AM] Leah Shanker: It
[11/19/2008 01:18:14 AM] Leah Shanker: It is like that with projecting success as well.
[11/19/2008 01:18:31 AM] Leah Shanker: The only gauge people can use from the outside is how good you are at what you do professionally.
[11/19/2008 01:19:02 AM] Leah Shanker: But to be truly successful, you need to be loved and very well-rounded.
[11/19/2008 01:19:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: not me, i want a woman that is ambitious and intelligent, she doesn't have to have the motherly capabilities right away, i am sure i am not suited to be a father, you have to learn how to be a parent together
[11/19/2008 01:19:55 AM] Leah Shanker: yup, I think you have found the perfect girl for you.
[11/19/2008 01:20:30 AM] Leah Shanker: Crystal is remarkably talented and intelligent plus stunningly beautiful.
[11/19/2008 01:20:41 AM] Leah Shanker: But she's not a mommy-type in the traditional sense.
[11/19/2008 01:21:15 AM] Leah Shanker: And I think the same goes for you :)
[11/19/2008 01:22:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am not a mommy type
[11/19/2008 01:22:13 AM] Leah Shanker: nope, and you're not a daddy type either.
[11/19/2008 01:22:18 AM] Leah Shanker: yet
[11/19/2008 01:22:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think i am talented or beautiful
[11/19/2008 01:22:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i need a better way to project myself
[11/19/2008 01:22:57 AM] Leah Shanker: nope, but you're passionate and fun.
[11/19/2008 01:24:08 AM] Leah Shanker: Best way to project yourself a different way is to be a different way :)
[11/19/2008 01:24:15 AM] Leah Shanker: that way there aren't any slip-ups.
[11/19/2008 01:25:07 AM] Leah Shanker: You've got helpings and helpings of ambitions. You know what you need to do to get respect from your peers, but you have to have the follow-through.
[11/19/2008 01:25:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Let me know when you want me to stufu.
[11/19/2008 01:25:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: no, it makes sense.
[11/19/2008 01:27:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess while i am still in college, showing that i have everything i need is as best i can do.  i am really good at my job, but there are people who do more then me, the radio stuff i've been working on with David is great, he and I are the most competent people in the place.
[11/19/2008 01:27:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i like when we agree, you and I, he and I
[11/19/2008 01:28:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: we get in the mode where it is constant agreement, we discuss alternative solutions and we always realize the best way to do something, it is like we have a joint mind
[11/19/2008 01:29:30 AM] Leah Shanker: Have you seen waking life?
[11/19/2008 01:29:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[11/19/2008 01:29:47 AM] Leah Shanker: Do you remember the scene with the African guy with big teeth?
[11/19/2008 01:29:58 AM] Leah Shanker: "A greater GREATER mind"
[11/19/2008 01:30:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: that movie makes me nauseous, i'd rather listen to it on audio tape
[11/19/2008 01:30:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[11/19/2008 01:30:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: i remember
[11/19/2008 01:30:38 AM] Leah Shanker: That's what a "joint mind" reminds me of.
[11/19/2008 01:30:48 AM] Leah Shanker: A big-teethed African dude saying that phrase.
[11/19/2008 01:30:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[11/19/2008 01:30:53 AM] Leah Shanker: Murphy has big teeth.
[11/19/2008 01:31:17 AM] Leah Shanker: Okay, It's time for bed Leah.

[12/05/2008 11:35:36 AM] Leah Shanker: I am saying she *acts* whorish.
[12/05/2008 11:35:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: w/e Steve is my friend, he akshually comes to my partays!
[12/05/2008 11:36:00 AM] Leah Shanker: Is that how you measure friendship?

[12/05/2008 11:41:48 AM] Leah Shanker: 10Q
[12/05/2008 11:46:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think Elyse has a nice body
[12/05/2008 11:47:24 AM] Leah Shanker: Eh, but that's not really a reason to date someone.
[12/05/2008 11:47:36 AM] Leah Shanker: Maybe that's a canadian frame of mind, whatever
[12/05/2008 11:48:14 AM] Leah Shanker: But then I forget who I'm talking to LOL
[12/05/2008 11:48:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't say anything about dating
[12/05/2008 11:48:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: she is my backup girlfriend
[12/05/2008 11:48:45 AM] Leah Shanker: LOL
[12/05/2008 11:48:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: and i'm her backup boyfriend
[12/05/2008 11:49:01 AM] Leah Shanker: that's so sad.
[12/05/2008 11:49:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[12/05/2008 11:49:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's fun
[12/05/2008 11:49:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: it means if we are ever broken up at the same time we will fuck like bunnies
[12/05/2008 11:49:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: and we always support each other emotionally
[12/05/2008 11:49:42 AM] Leah Shanker: lol, you guys are so weird.
[12/05/2008 11:49:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[12/05/2008 11:49:53 AM] Leah Shanker: seriously, no wonder the divorce rate is so high here, lols.
[12/05/2008 11:50:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: haha
[12/05/2008 11:50:23 AM] Leah Shanker: I suppose I'm old-school when I think that sex and love are the same thing and can't really be independent of each other.
[12/05/2008 11:50:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: you want to know whats really shitty between Crystal and I?
[12/05/2008 11:50:47 AM] Leah Shanker: you guys both have broken morals?
[12/05/2008 11:50:53 AM] Leah Shanker: lol, i'm just kidding. what?
[12/05/2008 11:51:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: just the opposite, I was completely devoted to her, 100%.  and it didn't matter how much flirting i did with Elyse, i still made time to talk to Crystal and i was still madly in love with her, even with the distance.
[12/05/2008 11:52:07 AM] Leah Shanker: Yes, but it was Crystal.
[12/05/2008 11:52:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: I was always honest with Crystal about Elyse and I hanging out a lot.
[12/05/2008 11:53:22 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, I'll let you in on a little Capricorn secret.
[12/05/2008 11:53:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: Crystal on the other hand, found a friend and started to like him, she diverted some of her feelings for me over to him.  We had everything going for us, we were incredibly attracted to each other, there was nothing that we couldn't simply talk about and work through if we ever had a problem.
[12/05/2008 11:53:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: And we managed to screw that up.
[12/05/2008 11:54:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: How does that happen?  When your relationship with someone is almost perfect and is always improving, how do you screw it up this bad?
[12/05/2008 11:54:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: It is chaotic.
[12/05/2008 11:54:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: Everything is meant to go wrong.
[12/05/2008 11:54:49 AM] Leah Shanker: Are you venting or would you like my real opinion?
[12/05/2008 11:55:01 AM] Leah Shanker: I can just tell you it'll be ok if you want.
[12/05/2008 11:55:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would love your opinion, i don't understand women at all apparently.
[12/05/2008 11:56:02 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, so this "harmless flirting" with Elise actually puts a lot of strain on a relationship *especially* a long distance relationship.
[12/05/2008 11:56:27 AM] Leah Shanker: Because in a normal, local relationship harmless flirting can actually do a lot for a relationship.
[12/05/2008 11:56:46 AM] Leah Shanker: It creates sort of harmless competition, makes your partner value you a little bit more, etc.
[12/05/2008 11:56:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/05/2008 11:57:02 AM] Leah Shanker: But in a long distance relationship, it's just entirely frustrating
[12/05/2008 11:57:13 AM] Leah Shanker: There's nothing you can do when you hear about it.
[12/05/2008 11:57:24 AM] Leah Shanker: You can just...get angry because you're hanging out with her.
[12/05/2008 11:57:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i can understand that
[12/05/2008 11:58:16 AM] Leah Shanker: and then, of course, your partner would much rather be flirted with than yelled at...
[12/05/2008 11:58:27 AM] Leah Shanker: so they tend to drift away.
[12/05/2008 11:59:18 AM] Leah Shanker: And, cold hard truth is
[12/05/2008 11:59:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: But i never really told Crystal about the flirting, i maybe mentioned it once, we only talked about who we hung out with, and there are guys that she would hang out with that i had to be ok with.  My point is, my feelings for her never diminished from being "distracted" by another woman; her's did and she didn't even have to flirt with the guy for it to happen.
[12/05/2008 12:00:46 PM] Leah Shanker: The reason I thought you and Crystal were so perfect together was because you tended to value or not value the same things.
[12/05/2008 12:00:56 PM] Leah Shanker: For example
[12/05/2008 12:01:24 PM] Leah Shanker: You both have kind of an open tendency toward outside flirting, etc.
[12/05/2008 12:02:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/05/2008 12:02:13 PM] Leah Shanker: You both have kind of loose restrictions of what you consider a relationship to be, etc.
[12/05/2008 12:02:46 PM] Leah Shanker: But then when something like this happens...
[12/05/2008 12:02:53 PM] Leah Shanker: you can't say that you didn't expect it.
[12/05/2008 12:03:56 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean, think about how your relationship actually came into fruition...
[12/05/2008 12:04:18 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm coming across as very cold here, and that's not my intention.
[12/05/2008 12:04:25 PM] Leah Shanker: I really do feel for you.
[12/05/2008 12:04:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: I think we are great together when we are actually together, we always get along.
[12/05/2008 12:04:34 PM] Leah Shanker: But I'm trying to help you.
[12/05/2008 12:05:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: And despite what you may think, we used to be completely committed to each other.
[12/05/2008 12:05:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: We don't have an "open" relationship, which is what you may be thinking of.
[12/05/2008 12:05:32 PM] Leah Shanker: And it just might be that my definition of fully committed isn't yours.
[12/05/2008 12:05:36 PM] Leah Shanker: No, that's not what  meant
[12/05/2008 12:05:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Just - you both tolerate things in a relationship that I don't think I could.
[12/05/2008 12:06:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: Then i am confused, what is your definition of being committed?
[12/05/2008 12:06:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: I see.
[12/05/2008 12:06:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: So the harmless flirting things?
[12/05/2008 12:06:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: *thing?
[12/05/2008 12:06:56 PM] Leah Shanker: That, and you know, feeding money to strippers with your teeth...
[12/05/2008 12:07:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[12/05/2008 12:07:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: good times
[12/05/2008 12:07:09 PM] Leah Shanker: haha
[12/05/2008 12:07:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Totally, and I think that's how you should view it.
[12/05/2008 12:07:33 PM] Leah Shanker: They were good times with Crystal.
[12/05/2008 12:07:49 PM] Leah Shanker: But honestly, you didn't see yourself marrying this girl.
[12/05/2008 12:09:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: Well the main difference between her and I, that i am trying to express is: i never let me feelings for her change, and that included showing restraint around other women and being cautious.  We had a great relationship that i could always turn to and think about whenever i was tempted by disloyal thoughts.  She did not have that strength, plain and simple.
[12/05/2008 12:10:18 PM] Leah Shanker: And you knew that deep down.
[12/05/2008 12:10:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Christ, we all knew it.
[12/05/2008 12:11:21 PM] Leah Shanker: She actually has somewhat of a reputation for...not being able to show restraint.
[12/05/2008 12:11:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah good point
[12/05/2008 12:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you are wrong about me.  about 2 weeks ago i was hanging out with Steve and i expressed to him that she could be the one.  That is evidence for how in to her i really was.  I really loved her, and i was confident in our relationship.  I would enjoy spending the rest of my life with her.
[12/05/2008 12:13:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: I didn't think that her inability to show restraint would affect our relationship because of how attracted we are to each other
[12/05/2008 12:13:37 PM] Leah Shanker: If you were confident in your relationship, you were deceiving yourself.
[12/05/2008 12:14:47 PM] Leah Shanker: All I can tell about you is that you tend to exude an image that you're a player. Whether or not you are.
[12/05/2008 12:14:59 PM] Leah Shanker: And I'm not in a relationship with you so I can't tell if that's real or not
[12/05/2008 12:15:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: well put.
[12/05/2008 12:16:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: I am not saying that i would change my image just to prove to you how much i love her, but if you spent more time around us when we were together you could see it in our eyes.  Other people definitely did, maybe you just missed it.
[12/05/2008 12:16:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Hm, maybe that's the fundamental difference between you and I.
[12/05/2008 12:17:06 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't judge a relationship by the look in someone's eyes.
[12/05/2008 12:17:14 PM] Leah Shanker: crap, I gotta take off.
[12/05/2008 12:17:18 PM] Leah Shanker: we can talk more about this later
[12/05/2008 12:17:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: it didn't define our relationship just provided evidence of it.

[12/05/2008 04:53:30 PM] Leah Shanker: I dont get you!
[12/05/2008 04:53:35 PM] Leah Shanker: you are so weird.
[12/05/2008 04:53:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i had so much to type
[12/05/2008 04:53:52 PM] Leah Shanker: so once again on facebook, you're back in a relationship with her?
[12/05/2008 04:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is what i was going to say
[12/05/2008 04:53:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: Am i missing something here?  How did you derive the conclusion that i judge a relationship based on a look in someones eye from me simply saying that it was there?  That doesn't make any sense at all, Aristotle was absolutely correct when he said Men have a high capacity to rationalize then Women.  Me recognizing that we have a special connection that can be seen by the way we look at each other has nothing to do with how I judge our relationship.  It is just one of the many things that people can see that makes us great together.  You totally jumped to the conclusion that I thought it was the only thing that defined our relationship; you based "the fundamental difference between you and I" on that 1 comment instead of this conversation as a whole.  That is very irrational of you, and not at all productive.
[12/05/2008 04:54:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that seems a little harsh
[12/05/2008 04:54:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i meant was, our relationship took a hit, and there is more to it then what people see from the outside
[12/05/2008 04:55:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i get irritated when people don't understand me
[12/05/2008 04:55:24 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, but you know... from the outside, we were right.
[12/05/2008 04:55:43 PM] Leah Shanker: You don't allow people in, so you can't get angry when they don't know you
[12/05/2008 04:55:51 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm the same way
[12/05/2008 04:57:09 PM] Leah Shanker: What I am trying to convey to you here is that I think we have a very different set of moral values. So perhaps I am not a very good source of relationship advice for you.
[12/05/2008 04:58:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wouldn't call it moral values
[12/05/2008 04:58:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would say freedoms
[12/05/2008 04:58:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not a jealous boyfriend, and she doesn't get jealous either, so putting dollar bills on strippers is all in good fun
[12/05/2008 04:59:30 PM] Leah Shanker: You exude the vibe of being a player - i.e. someone who isn't serious about relationships.
[12/05/2008 04:59:47 PM] Leah Shanker: You date girls who have terrible reputations for not being good at relationships.
[12/05/2008 05:00:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Or one, at least.
[12/05/2008 05:00:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: only one
[12/05/2008 05:00:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am a player
[12/05/2008 05:00:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't mean i can't commit, it just means that in normal situations i would choose not to
[12/05/2008 05:00:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have chosen to commit to crystal
[12/05/2008 05:00:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and nothing can come between that
[12/05/2008 05:01:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Still?
[12/05/2008 05:01:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Someone else I know spoke exactly like you are now about Crystal.
[12/05/2008 05:01:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[12/05/2008 05:01:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not going to say, yes Still, because you never know until after the fact
[12/05/2008 05:02:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like neither of us realized how much we needed each other until after our feelings got lost
[12/05/2008 05:03:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: Steve lacked the ability to do what was necessary.  Stealing a guy's girl is messed up, and if someone did it to me i would punch their fucking lights out.
[12/05/2008 05:04:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: I am considering getting a plane ticket after finals just so i can have a word with this other guy Crystal likes.
[12/05/2008 05:04:13 PM] Leah Shanker: You're saying what was necessary was to punch your fucking lights out?
[12/05/2008 05:04:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm saying maybe if he did that, Crystal wouldn't have come back to me instead of him.
[12/05/2008 05:05:07 PM] Leah Shanker: That's a very guy mentality.
[12/05/2008 05:05:13 PM] Leah Shanker: And completely untrue.
[12/05/2008 05:05:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: we will never know
[12/05/2008 05:05:54 PM] Leah Shanker: And if you're truly committed to her, you would want to see her happy.
[12/05/2008 05:06:16 PM] Leah Shanker: And if this guy makes her happy, you should allow her happiness.
[12/05/2008 05:06:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah there is a big difference between happiness and loneliness
[12/05/2008 05:07:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: just because you are lonely doesn't mean the relationship you have isn't worth it
[12/05/2008 05:07:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: distance is the only reason she was attracted to this guy
[12/05/2008 05:07:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was a lot more wrong with he and steve then just that
[12/05/2008 05:07:37 PM] Leah Shanker: You know that she told Steve that she was only dating you to have some fun before she takes off right?
[12/05/2008 05:08:12 PM] Leah Shanker: A relationship she talks about that and began on the terms that yours did is destined to end badly.
[12/05/2008 05:08:16 PM] Leah Shanker: like that*
[12/05/2008 05:09:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah maybe your right
[12/05/2008 05:09:05 PM] Leah Shanker: IE - she cheating on her boyfriend to be with you while knowingly moving away in a few months...
[12/05/2008 05:09:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd like to think that it is all different now, and that doesn't matter anymore, she hopelessly fell in love with me, and i her
[12/05/2008 05:10:16 PM] Leah Shanker: And I desperately thought I could change my abusive ex-boyfriend.
[12/05/2008 05:10:37 PM] Leah Shanker: For the same reason - we felt so strongly for each other.The logistics will sort themselves out
[12/05/2008 05:10:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe she will never change?
[12/05/2008 05:10:47 PM] Leah Shanker: nope
[12/05/2008 05:10:56 PM] Leah Shanker: or maybe she will, but you can't change her.
[12/05/2008 05:11:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/05/2008 05:12:08 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway
[12/05/2008 05:12:19 PM] Leah Shanker: on the bright side, you can steve can be in the same room together again!
[12/05/2008 05:12:22 PM] Leah Shanker: that's good news
[12/05/2008 05:12:50 PM] Leah Shanker: both burned by the same woman, i guess you even have something in common now.
[12/05/2008 05:13:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck that shit
[12/05/2008 05:13:14 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm only kidding, i dont think you guys will ever be true friends
[12/05/2008 05:13:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not like him
[12/05/2008 05:13:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know when it is over
[12/05/2008 05:13:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would much rather be the one that got away then the whiny ex-boyfriend that can't let it go
[12/05/2008 05:13:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never had a problem being in the same room with him
[12/05/2008 05:13:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is the one that did
[12/05/2008 05:14:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you guys had a problem with us being in the same room
[12/05/2008 05:14:40 PM] Leah Shanker: well yeah, you were *that guy*.
[12/05/2008 05:14:48 PM] Leah Shanker: Steve's an excellent guy
[12/05/2008 05:14:53 PM] Leah Shanker: completely readty
[12/05/2008 05:15:01 PM] Leah Shanker: ready to be in a long-term relationship
[12/05/2008 05:15:16 PM] Leah Shanker: all of his efforts over the years have been trying to control and change broken Crystal
[12/05/2008 05:15:37 PM] Leah Shanker: And I suppose he viewed this like every other time - just a temporary setback
[12/05/2008 05:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: I am ready to be in a long term relationship, i've just accepted that i can't change her by myself, she has to work at it to
[12/05/2008 05:17:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and what do you mean i was "that guy"?
[12/05/2008 05:17:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: the whiny ex-boyfriend?
[12/05/2008 05:17:40 PM] Leah Shanker: no, the guy who knew she was in a relationship and didn't stop her from cheating.
[12/05/2008 05:18:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah
[12/05/2008 05:19:51 PM] Leah Shanker: there are these kind of stigmas for a reason, I guess.
[12/05/2008 05:20:23 PM] Leah Shanker: player, slut, cheater, homewrecker, etc.
[12/05/2008 05:20:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am still thinking of a counter argument
[12/05/2008 05:22:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't be a homewrecker if they didn't have a home, you act like they were married
[12/05/2008 05:22:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't matter what "you planned on doing", that's bullshit
[12/05/2008 05:23:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: and homewrecker is just a cruel term, i really don't appreciate it, i can deal with you calling me a player, or you implying that she is a slut, but that isn't fair
[12/05/2008 05:23:10 PM] Leah Shanker: a relationship is a relationship regardless of whether it's matured into marriage or not.
[12/05/2008 05:23:44 PM] Leah Shanker: im kidding about the homewrecker thing.
[12/05/2008 05:23:51 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm sorry if i've offended you
[12/05/2008 05:24:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats bullshit about it maturing in to it
[12/05/2008 05:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you allow it to get cut off by another guy, then it wasn't meant to be
[12/05/2008 05:24:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: just like all the other things that would indicate it isn't mean to be, like cheating and trying to "fix things"
[12/05/2008 05:25:00 PM] Leah Shanker: married/unmarried just determines how easy it is to break it off for me I guess.
[12/05/2008 05:25:14 PM] Leah Shanker: all that would be required for her
[12/05/2008 05:25:21 PM] Leah Shanker: is to say it's over before going over to your house
[12/05/2008 05:25:24 PM] Leah Shanker: that's it.
[12/05/2008 05:25:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: steve cheated on her too
[12/05/2008 05:25:57 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah I heard about that. we're not talking about that relationship though
[12/05/2008 05:26:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that wouldn't indicate that it wasn't meant to be
[12/05/2008 05:26:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: they couldn't commit to each other
[12/05/2008 05:26:19 PM] Leah Shanker: I completely agree. And she probably should have broken it off then.
[12/05/2008 05:26:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can't be the only one held responsible for breaking it up
[12/05/2008 05:26:33 PM] Leah Shanker: I am not saying steve and crystal should be together.
[12/05/2008 05:27:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can commit
[12/05/2008 05:27:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have
[12/05/2008 05:27:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she is trying, just like she did with steve
[12/05/2008 05:27:27 PM] Leah Shanker: and that went well?
[12/05/2008 05:27:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am just viewing this like a setback, maybe just like he did, except we only get 1 do-over, not a dozen
[12/05/2008 05:28:32 PM] Leah Shanker: I can't speak on whether you can commit or not.
[12/05/2008 05:28:39 PM] Leah Shanker: But I seriously doubt that she can.
[12/05/2008 05:29:07 PM] Leah Shanker: And you should demand someone who can commit to you if you're going to be throwing yourself at someone.
[12/05/2008 05:29:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not one to put up with cheating, i've never been the "get back together" type, if it ends once then it should probably be over because we would just be delaying the inevitable, but i think she is worth giving it another try
[12/05/2008 05:29:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are so many times when i have considered hooking up with 1 of the 4 potential girls i could be sleeping with right now
[12/05/2008 05:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i thought commitment would be better then empty sex.
[12/05/2008 05:30:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i want to believe it will work
[12/05/2008 05:30:13 PM] Leah Shanker: always is
[12/05/2008 05:30:38 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, good luck then.
[12/05/2008 05:30:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[12/05/2008 05:31:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean for everything
[12/05/2008 05:31:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you helped more then just to make me more paranoid
[12/05/2008 05:32:00 PM] Leah Shanker: lol, sorry about that.
[12/05/2008 05:32:06 PM] Leah Shanker: I sort of figured it was over.
[12/05/2008 05:32:26 PM] Leah Shanker: I was trying to help you with future relationships
[12/05/2008 05:33:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, who knows, maybe i am wasting my time with her, but i won't know until after the fact
[12/05/2008 05:35:11 PM] Leah Shanker: what are you doing tonight?
[12/05/2008 05:35:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i got to know you a lot more. even though we sometimes disagree
[12/05/2008 05:35:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to ice jaks
[12/05/2008 05:35:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: then to steve's performance

[12/15/2008 03:52:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: that was always my problem, i would put like 40 hours a week into a site and maybe make 300 bucks for 2 months of work
[12/15/2008 03:52:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was underpaid
[12/15/2008 03:52:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah the doctors immediately offered me more than I would have asked for
[12/15/2008 03:52:58 PM] Leah Shanker: but the business guys I sort of took another approach

[12/15/2008 03:53:23 PM] Leah Shanker: And they said ok
[12/15/2008 03:53:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i remember

[12/15/2008 03:53:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have been working on that for a little while now right?
[12/15/2008 03:53:52 PM] Leah Shanker: 10 hours/week during the semester and now I'm working full time for them
[12/15/2008 03:54:05 PM] Leah Shanker: It's great, they're business guys so they think everything I do is magic.

[12/15/2008 03:58:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have got to play that song on my surround sound
[12/15/2008 03:58:47 PM] Leah Shanker: so are you guys doing ok?
[12/15/2008 03:58:50 PM] Leah Shanker: is he still moving out?
[12/15/2008 03:59:12 PM] Leah Shanker: it seems like you are a required influence on him. he'll sulk in his cave if not for you.
[12/15/2008 03:59:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like to think that
[12/15/2008 03:59:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: but despite my efforts he still is very reclusive
[12/15/2008 03:59:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and apathetic
[12/15/2008 04:01:25 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, he needs something that makes him happy.
[12/15/2008 04:01:36 PM] Leah Shanker: and I'm not sure what that might be.
[12/15/2008 04:01:48 PM] Leah Shanker: competition seems to get him out of his shell.
[12/15/2008 04:02:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i really don't know either, this robotics thing might be helping, we have actually talked about it a lot
[12/15/2008 04:02:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: he is kind of annoyed at people not taking it seriously and just wanting to put death lazers on it, no one is talking about practical ideas
[12/15/2008 04:03:09 PM] Leah Shanker: I suppose he doesn't understand the concept of cheerleading.
[12/15/2008 04:03:36 PM] Leah Shanker: It's sort of like, you get people excited about something with something really fun-sounding that wouldn't actually happen in the project
[12/15/2008 04:03:57 PM] Leah Shanker: And then you move on to what the robot can really do.
[12/15/2008 04:04:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah but if you are cheer leading without any game to cheer for you just look foolish
[12/15/2008 04:04:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have no game
[12/15/2008 04:04:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: we just have cheer leading
[12/15/2008 04:04:31 PM] Leah Shanker: yes we do
[12/15/2008 04:05:19 PM] Leah Shanker: we have funding, which is huge. we have a remarkable amount of interest and tons of people in the group

[12/15/2008 04:13:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: catholics are crazy
[12/15/2008 04:13:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: my mom is catholic
[12/15/2008 04:13:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is so much doctrine that no one follows
[12/15/2008 04:13:48 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, seriously.
[12/15/2008 04:13:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the pope never dismisses any of it
[12/15/2008 04:14:03 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't jibe with the whole: do not enjoy sex because it is solely for procreating thing.
[12/15/2008 04:14:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: "You can only have salvation through the catholic church"
[12/15/2008 04:14:30 PM] Leah Shanker: It's a religion that preys on people's guilt.
[12/15/2008 04:14:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/15/2008 04:15:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i never feel guilty after sex
[12/15/2008 04:15:17 PM] Leah Shanker: maybe sometimes you should :P
[12/15/2008 04:15:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[12/15/2008 04:15:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: neg
[12/15/2008 04:15:36 PM] Leah Shanker: I've never felt guilty after sex either.
[12/15/2008 04:15:43 PM] Leah Shanker: I've felt guilty after masturbating.
[12/15/2008 04:16:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Still dealing with that. Luckily it's not really a problem anymore.
[12/15/2008 04:16:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would bet 100% the guy would be up for taking care of the woman in a young marriage like yours
[12/15/2008 04:16:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: crystal disappointed me the other day
[12/15/2008 04:17:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said "when you are like 40 years old you probably won't want to have sex very often"
[12/15/2008 04:17:41 PM] Leah Shanker: she's right though
[12/15/2008 04:17:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: not if i can help it
[12/15/2008 04:17:50 PM] Leah Shanker: chemically speaking
[12/15/2008 04:18:48 PM] Leah Shanker: It may be less often, but the sex does get better and better the more often you have it with the same person
[12/15/2008 04:18:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/15/2008 04:19:03 PM] Leah Shanker: so I can imagine after 40 years it will be like your mind is being read.
[12/15/2008 04:19:21 PM] Leah Shanker: but, honestly, it probably will be less often.
[12/15/2008 04:19:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/15/2008 04:22:36 PM] Leah Shanker: you know
[12/15/2008 04:23:20 PM] Leah Shanker: nevermind, it weird telling you that.
[12/15/2008 04:23:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: what?
[12/15/2008 04:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[12/15/2008 04:24:05 PM] Leah Shanker: here's something disturbing for you
[12/15/2008 04:24:05 PM] Leah Shanker: (Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzn1Ln2nEzI)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzn1Ln2nEzI
[12/15/2008 04:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg
[12/15/2008 04:24:36 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[12/15/2008 04:24:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: why do you send me this stuff
[12/15/2008 04:24:50 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[12/15/2008 04:25:18 PM] Leah Shanker: no matter how bad your life gets
[12/15/2008 04:25:24 PM] Leah Shanker: you'll always be cooler than that guy.
[12/15/2008 04:25:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[12/15/2008 04:26:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: when NiN played survivalism they showed TV screens on different stuff, one had 2 people fucking in a bathroom
[12/15/2008 04:27:20 PM] Leah Shanker: haha
[12/15/2008 04:27:48 PM] Leah Shanker: milking that first ammendment
[12/15/2008 04:28:18 PM] Leah Shanker: can I tell you something in complete confidence?
[12/15/2008 04:28:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course
[12/15/2008 04:28:34 PM] Leah Shanker: without you obnoxiously bringing it up in front of our friends?
[12/15/2008 04:28:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't do that
[12/15/2008 04:28:49 PM] Leah Shanker: yes you do!
[12/15/2008 04:28:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: when?
[12/15/2008 04:29:49 PM] Leah Shanker: like we were in 105 and you said something about me having sex in the engineering bathroom
[12/15/2008 04:30:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[12/15/2008 04:30:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't actually say it though
[12/15/2008 04:30:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just hinted at it
[12/15/2008 04:30:26 PM] Leah Shanker: but it was obvious enough to anyone who was paying attention
[12/15/2008 04:30:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i promise i want tell anyone
[12/15/2008 04:30:31 PM] Leah Shanker: luckily nobody was but you know
[12/15/2008 04:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: *won't
[12/15/2008 04:31:28 PM] Leah Shanker: So we have the opposite problem in our relationship than most.
[12/15/2008 04:31:47 PM] Leah Shanker: I pretty much want sex all the time, every moment of every day.
[12/15/2008 04:32:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Even like, right after sex. If it were up to me, we'd spend all weekend long in bed.
[12/15/2008 04:32:35 PM] Leah Shanker: Matt's been trying to convince me that I'm a sex addict solely because I have a stronger sex drive than he does.
[12/15/2008 04:32:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: Damn, i can't even get Crystal to cuddle with me after.
[12/15/2008 04:33:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: Do you actually get off often?
[12/15/2008 04:33:13 PM] Leah Shanker: nope, that's the thing.
[12/15/2008 04:33:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Whenever I go it alone, I always feel guilty and lonely afterwards.
[12/15/2008 04:33:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: Wait, if you aren't getting off, then he isn't doing his job.
[12/15/2008 04:34:04 PM] Leah Shanker: oh that's not what you were asking
[12/15/2008 04:34:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: I mean during sex, do you get off most the time?
[12/15/2008 04:34:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: Crystal and i always try to keep it pretty even.
[12/15/2008 04:34:37 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I do. But I kind of have to bring it on myself.
[12/15/2008 04:34:54 PM] Leah Shanker: He's not really interested in learning my techniques either, he sort of just...let me
[12/15/2008 04:34:56 PM] Leah Shanker: lets me
[12/15/2008 04:35:13 PM] Leah Shanker: If it were up to him, every time we have sex would be quick and dirty.
[12/15/2008 04:35:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: typical
[12/15/2008 04:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm. Does he go down on you?
[12/15/2008 04:36:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, and when he does it's spectacular.
[12/15/2008 04:36:09 PM] Leah Shanker: But not really often, it's kind of a treat.
[12/15/2008 04:36:13 PM] Leah Shanker: The unfair thing is
[12/15/2008 04:36:19 PM] Leah Shanker: I really do enjoy going down on him
[12/15/2008 04:36:32 PM] Leah Shanker: and I actually get more pleasure out of his enjoyment than my own.
[12/15/2008 04:36:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[12/15/2008 04:36:53 PM] Leah Shanker: I just kind of wish it was the same.
[12/15/2008 04:37:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to say most of the time the guy feels the same way
[12/15/2008 04:37:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i realized that isn't really true
[12/15/2008 04:37:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i certainly do
[12/15/2008 04:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: Sex definitely takes two
[12/15/2008 04:37:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: It is kind of hard for the guy to manage his own pleasure and get the girl off at the same time
[12/15/2008 04:38:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think it is good practice if the girl does some of the work on herself too
[12/15/2008 04:38:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: then no one is left out
[12/15/2008 04:39:08 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, and I keep trying to think that way.
[12/15/2008 04:39:33 PM] Leah Shanker: But it's so weird.
[12/15/2008 04:39:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: to masturbate while he's inside you?
[12/15/2008 04:39:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: it isn't weird at all
[12/15/2008 04:40:02 PM] Leah Shanker: No, that's not what I meant. Just the situation.
[12/15/2008 04:40:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Our very different sex drives.
[12/15/2008 04:40:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[12/15/2008 04:40:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I've tried every single female trick in the book.
[12/15/2008 04:40:41 PM] Leah Shanker: I will literally prance around the house and cook dinner in my sexiest lingerie
[12/15/2008 04:40:57 PM] Leah Shanker: and he'll greet me, kiss me on the cheek and go back to what he's working on.
[12/15/2008 04:41:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[12/15/2008 04:41:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: cute
[12/15/2008 04:41:23 PM] Leah Shanker: I've tried making myself unavailable.
[12/15/2008 04:41:33 PM] Leah Shanker: But it's ridiculous. He can go a month without even flinching
[12/15/2008 04:41:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think oral is very important, have you told him how much you enjoy it over the other stuff?
[12/15/2008 04:42:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess you can't really force a sex drive
[12/15/2008 04:42:40 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, he knows.
[12/15/2008 04:42:58 PM] Leah Shanker: And when he wants to put in the effort, it's incredible.
[12/15/2008 04:43:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he doesn't want to wear it out too soon
[12/15/2008 04:43:46 PM] Leah Shanker: that's a romantic notion, but he doesn't think like that at all, lol.
[12/15/2008 04:44:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: well he sounds like a pretty normal guy to me
[12/15/2008 04:44:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe he needs something more concrete
[12/15/2008 04:44:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: like a schedule
[12/15/2008 04:44:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have friday night dates
[12/15/2008 04:44:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: isn't that usually a guaranteed lay?
[12/15/2008 04:44:53 PM] Leah Shanker: I know. I've been trying to resist that from the moment it was suggested.
[12/15/2008 04:45:08 PM] Leah Shanker: a "sex time" schedule sounds like the opposite of sexy to me.
[12/15/2008 04:45:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can still have sex outside of the schedule
[12/15/2008 04:45:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: like on the floor of the egr bathroom, it could be spontaneous too
[12/15/2008 04:45:38 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[12/15/2008 04:45:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but maybe he just works differently
[12/15/2008 04:45:56 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, i'm still struggling to figure him out.
[12/15/2008 04:46:06 PM] Leah Shanker: He gives me lists of things that he likes in bed
[12/15/2008 04:46:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean, he does a ton of work on the computer, projects and stuff
[12/15/2008 04:46:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and for some people it is just hard to let something go, and take a break for a while
[12/15/2008 04:46:35 PM] Leah Shanker: and I do them, and it doesn't really make a difference
[12/15/2008 04:46:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: like it has to get finished asap
[12/15/2008 04:47:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol a list, that's a good idea
[12/15/2008 04:47:26 PM] Leah Shanker: But it seems so weird.
[12/15/2008 04:47:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can imagine if he is really into working on something, some spontaneous sex isn't really an option
[12/15/2008 04:47:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: or possible in some cases
[12/15/2008 04:48:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's why a schedule would be helpful, because he could let go of whatever he is working on, and focus on you, and the night
[12/15/2008 04:48:35 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, and it's getting to the point where I'm going to have to embrace that.
[12/15/2008 04:48:42 PM] Leah Shanker: even though it's incredibly un-sexy.
[12/15/2008 04:48:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not a weekly thing, maybe just set up something the night before, tell him you want to have dinner together and watch a movie and be together
[12/15/2008 04:49:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: that can still be sexy
[12/15/2008 04:49:13 PM] Leah Shanker: hm, anticipation. I like it.
[12/15/2008 04:49:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can dress up in nice underwear
[12/15/2008 04:49:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and pick out something you will both enjoy
[12/15/2008 04:49:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe talk about some of the things on the list, don't just try to do them
[12/15/2008 04:50:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: you might not be doing them the way he imagined, discussing each other performance in bed is really important
[12/15/2008 04:50:30 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, he doesn't really like talking about it..
[12/15/2008 04:50:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't count the number of times crystal has said we will have to work on the oral sex
[12/15/2008 04:50:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i can imagine
[12/15/2008 04:50:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Last time I tried to bring it up
[12/15/2008 04:51:19 PM] Leah Shanker: it was mayhem, he said it made him feel insecure about having sex with me and now he wants to have even less sex.
[12/15/2008 04:51:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes it is a inferiority thing, if everything wasn't perfect then it is his fault
[12/15/2008 04:51:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's exactly what i was getting at
[12/15/2008 04:51:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: it can be hard to talk about
[12/15/2008 04:52:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I've kind of stopped talking about it and more just given him good feedback when it's good.
[12/15/2008 04:52:55 PM] Leah Shanker: instead of pointing out the things I don't particularly like.
[12/15/2008 04:53:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know you pretty well, and i know sometimes you can be a little overly critical, so i think talking about the good aspects are a really good way to start that conversation
[12/15/2008 04:53:56 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[12/15/2008 04:54:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: encourage trying, different things, when i first started giving oral, i wasn't any good, crystal told me to make different motions, and never really said she didn't like something, just let me know when she liked something else more
[12/15/2008 04:54:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: *encourage trying different things
[12/15/2008 04:54:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know why i put a comma there
[12/15/2008 04:55:17 PM] Leah Shanker: it makes sense, it's a natual pause.
[12/15/2008 04:56:02 PM] Leah Shanker: I am really trying to work on being less critical.
[12/15/2008 04:56:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you might have to dig a little deeper when it comes to his list of things that he likes, maybe talk about what you can do for him to make it even better
[12/15/2008 04:56:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not a bad thing necessarily, you are just very straight forward with whats wrong or right
[12/15/2008 04:59:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so definitely try the positive re-enforcement, and instead of telling him exactly what to do to you, maybe just suggest different things to try, he has to become comfortable with it, it isn't something that can change immediately
 and also try the warning ahead of time, tell him that you want some time together early in the day, coax him away from his computer and into the moment
[12/15/2008 05:00:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: Crystal and i are always straight forward with each other, if i need a break from what i am working on, i'll ask if she wants to fuck, or sometimes if we are out somewhere with friends she will whisper sexy things into my ear, then i know exactly what she wants to happen later
[12/15/2008 05:01:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: but not everyone can be that open about it
[12/15/2008 05:02:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, and it's definitely easier in the first few years of your relationship too
[12/15/2008 05:02:27 PM] Leah Shanker: you and crystal are still very fresh and undiscovered to each other. we actually used to be a lot like that too.
[12/15/2008 05:02:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, i guess you can't imagine that changing until it does
[12/15/2008 05:03:08 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, I've read studies done
[12/15/2008 05:03:16 PM] Leah Shanker: they say anywhere from 1 year - 2.5 years
[12/15/2008 05:03:24 PM] Leah Shanker: your brain chemicals change
[12/15/2008 05:03:36 PM] Leah Shanker: and you move away from the lusty must-have-you-right-now attitude
[12/15/2008 05:03:51 PM] Leah Shanker: to a more matured love, less want and more...true love.
[12/15/2008 05:04:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm interesting
[12/15/2008 05:04:39 PM] Leah Shanker: It's hard to explain if you've never been there, but just because you aren't totally lusty for someone doesn't mean your relationship is dying.
[12/15/2008 05:04:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds like you still have a lot of want
[12/15/2008 05:05:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Yup, but not in the same way
[12/15/2008 05:05:14 PM] Leah Shanker: ok, well, in my case you get to hear all of my pent up energy.
[12/15/2008 05:05:26 PM] Leah Shanker: but I'm making it seem worse than it is really.
[12/15/2008 05:06:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so, have you tried a more nurturing approach, instead of the tease with lingerie and being unavailable
[12/15/2008 05:06:29 PM] Leah Shanker: what do you mean? cuddling?
[12/15/2008 05:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i guess more stroking
[12/15/2008 05:07:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: cuddling is nice, but it cuddling can always go either way
[12/15/2008 05:08:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: a hand up the shirt definitely points in one direction
[12/15/2008 05:08:48 PM] Leah Shanker: except that I sort of always do that, even when were cuddling.
[12/15/2008 05:08:54 PM] Leah Shanker: It's sort of hard to distinguish.
[12/15/2008 05:09:09 PM] Leah Shanker: But that's a good idea, I'll have to think about that.
[12/15/2008 05:10:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just mean try things that are definitely more "coming on-to him" but not quite as drastic as cooking in just an apron, sounds like he needs to be coaxed in to it more
[12/15/2008 05:10:28 PM] Leah Shanker: lol
[12/15/2008 05:11:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: sometimes for me at least it's even more arousing to see a woman dress up to impress me then showing it all at once
[12/15/2008 05:12:14 PM] Leah Shanker: hmm
[12/15/2008 05:13:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but both ideas are nice sometimes, you just have to read him and find out what turns him on the most
[12/15/2008 05:13:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: it will change, like phases
[12/15/2008 05:13:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think that is a big difference between new relationships and long relationships
[12/15/2008 05:13:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: the person gets hard to read, because you don't see such drastic changes in the way they react
[12/15/2008 05:15:38 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, that's a really good point.
[12/15/2008 05:16:37 PM] Leah Shanker: thanks, brian.
[12/15/2008 05:16:46 PM] Leah Shanker: you've really made me see things in a different way
[12/15/2008 05:17:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: he should hang out with us more, David smith and I are incredibly sexually oriented people, so talking about sex lives is never something to be shy about
[12/15/2008 05:18:27 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm not sure you'd be able to get him to talk about it
[12/15/2008 05:18:40 PM] Leah Shanker: he sort of has a man-front.
[12/15/2008 05:18:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol

[12/15/2008 05:19:12 PM] Leah Shanker: and make jokes and everything, but I'm not sure you could get him to really talk about it.
[12/15/2008 05:19:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: we were talking about the most/least, and shortest/longest masturbating times with some girls a few weeks ago, it was pretty amusing
[12/15/2008 05:20:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: just an example of how not weird these topics are for us to talk about
[12/15/2008 05:20:29 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't think he looks at porn.
[12/15/2008 05:20:47 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean, I haven't checked extensively and he is a security guy
[12/15/2008 05:21:12 PM] Leah Shanker: but when we were first dating I told him it weirds me out
[12/15/2008 05:21:21 PM] Leah Shanker: and I honestly don't think he does anymore.

[12/15/2008 05:22:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean, sex once a week is better then jerking off every day
[12/15/2008 05:23:32 PM] Leah Shanker: But at this point, I kind of secretly want him to be.
[12/15/2008 05:23:38 PM] Leah Shanker: even if it does still weird me out.

[02/09/2009 09:48:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: i probably won't get there until like 11:15 your best bet is to go up to the EE projects room and ask them if you can use their tools
[02/09/2009 09:48:50 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, nobody's up there, sadly.
[02/09/2009 09:49:04 AM] Leah Shanker: meh, it's no biggie if I can't get it, I'll just do it for the next project.

[02/11/2009 02:58:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: can you think of a good string to hash system that is reversible?
[02/11/2009 03:00:10 PM] Leah Shanker: hrm, add up values of each character
[02/11/2009 03:00:23 PM] Leah Shanker: so
 L+E+A+H = hash
[02/11/2009 03:00:37 PM] Leah Shanker: lots of collisions, but it might do for what you're looking for
[02/11/2009 04:02:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really just need to encode the string into something numeric that is completely reversible
[02/11/2009 04:07:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: what base is text?
[02/11/2009 04:07:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it 256?

[02/11/2009 10:21:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you need to use the relay on the board to power the lcd panel
[02/11/2009 10:22:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is only one relay though, if you need to put a 5V signal as input and power then you need more then one relay, so you won't be able to do it

[02/11/2009 10:24:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Can't use a relay, too much noise for a tiny lcd.
[02/11/2009 10:25:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you must be using the relay wrong
[02/11/2009 10:25:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Also can't use an optocoupler because I don't have one. Can't use a mosfet because it adds too much static.
[02/11/2009 10:25:39 PM] Leah Shanker: And these resistors aren't cutting it either.
[02/11/2009 10:25:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: an opamp?
[02/11/2009 10:26:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you need a 5V signal?
[02/11/2009 10:26:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: or just 5V power?
[02/11/2009 10:27:20 PM] Leah Shanker: A 5v signal. opamp won't work because I don't have negative power.
[02/11/2009 10:42:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: well from my knowledge a relay should be able so solve all your problems, if that's not working i don't know what will

[02/12/2009 05:14:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: apache isn't installed so how do you plan on running the install scripts for joomla?
[02/12/2009 05:14:58 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm installing apache.
[02/12/2009 05:15:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: using apt?
[02/12/2009 05:15:20 PM] Leah Shanker: no, using scp

[02/12/2009 05:21:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: well tell me how far you get with installing packages and i will work on getting apt working
[02/12/2009 05:41:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see any apache

[02/18/2009 10:31:53 AM] Leah Shanker: this bastard here
[02/18/2009 10:32:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was just thinking that
[02/18/2009 10:32:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/18/2009 10:32:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it is kind of dumb and we might considering modding this, but people can't edit the nodes without being able to edit the title, for some reason it doesn't submit the title
[02/18/2009 10:32:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it gives the error "Must fill required fields" or whatever
[02/18/2009 10:33:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: so i made the authenticated users less access, they can basically manage all their own content and post anywhere
[02/18/2009 10:33:14 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah that's the problem I was trying to show at the officer meeting
[02/18/2009 10:33:31 AM] Leah Shanker: ah ok, no editing for auth users.
[02/18/2009 10:33:36 AM] Leah Shanker: just trusted users?
[02/18/2009 10:33:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: so, yeah i added a trusted users account that we can put all the officers in
[02/18/2009 10:34:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: so from now on instruct people to post in the comments, and we can manage the full article
[02/18/2009 10:34:50 AM] Leah Shanker: Alrighty, will do.
[02/18/2009 10:36:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i am thinking we need to edit the node module and make it reset the title in the request instead of remove it
[02/18/2009 10:49:28 AM] Leah Shanker: Hrm, I think we should set it so personal blog entries of members don't show up on the front page.
[02/18/2009 10:49:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: is there an option for it or do we have to mod it?
[02/18/2009 10:50:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: and there is a patch for a module that supports mass mailing
[02/18/2009 10:50:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: it is called Advanced Users
[02/18/2009 10:50:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: for 5
[02/18/2009 10:50:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: this shit takes too long
[02/18/2009 10:50:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: they need to maintain all this functionality
[02/18/2009 10:51:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: this is like basic stuff
[02/18/2009 10:51:37 AM] Leah Shanker: seriously.
[02/18/2009 10:51:51 AM] Leah Shanker: there's an option I think for this, I'll dig.
[02/18/2009 10:52:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: when users create modules for a stable release, the project should take over the code maintenance for them

[02/24/2009 12:36:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: why whats up?
[02/24/2009 12:37:04 AM] Leah Shanker: I'm getting access forbidden messages when trying to create new content types and such
[02/24/2009 12:37:13 AM] Leah Shanker: Where is the admin folder located?
[02/24/2009 12:38:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know
[02/24/2009 12:38:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: it blocks off campus
[02/24/2009 12:38:40 AM] Leah Shanker: Oh I know, I'm on campus.
[02/24/2009 12:38:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it could be you are trying to insert malicious text

[02/25/2009 04:42:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: because she is your friend or potential friend
[02/25/2009 04:43:13 PM] Leah Shanker: erm, probably not.
[02/25/2009 04:43:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's not mean like abe's ex girlfriend
[02/25/2009 04:43:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have 1 on 1 lunch with me
[02/25/2009 04:43:59 PM] Leah Shanker: sure, that's because you're my friend.
[02/25/2009 04:44:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's just like me but won't pick on you

[03/01/2009 03:05:14 PM] Leah Shanker: can you take care of the module updates
[03/01/2009 03:05:26 PM] Leah Shanker: this would be so much easier if we were using joomla, btw.
[03/01/2009 03:05:42 PM] Leah Shanker: seriously, every time a module has an available update
[03/01/2009 03:06:10 PM] Leah Shanker: you have to download the tarfile to your desktop, connect over scp, move it to the correct folder, extract it on the server and THEN drupal updates it.
[03/01/2009 03:07:33 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, they're here
[03/01/2009 03:07:33 PM] Leah Shanker: (Link: http://acm.cefns.nau.edu/admin/reports/updates)http://acm.cefns.nau.edu/admin/reports/updates
[03/01/2009 03:08:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't use wget?
[03/01/2009 03:08:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, but that has to be done from the server
[03/01/2009 03:09:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[03/01/2009 03:09:04 PM] Leah Shanker: which means I'd need to access that website with lynx from the server
[03/01/2009 03:09:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so?
[03/01/2009 03:09:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: nvm
[03/01/2009 03:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: done
[03/01/2009 03:12:42 PM] Leah Shanker: what did you do?
[03/01/2009 03:12:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: updated the stuff on that page like you said
[03/01/2009 03:13:02 PM] Leah Shanker: oh ok, thanks
[03/01/2009 03:13:05 PM] Leah Shanker: wait, just manually?
[03/01/2009 03:13:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: uhhh what do you mean by manually?
[03/01/2009 03:13:34 PM] Leah Shanker: i'm gonna write a perl script to do this automatically
[03/01/2009 03:13:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it took my like 30 seconds
[03/01/2009 03:13:57 PM] Leah Shanker: but it's tedious!
[03/01/2009 03:14:11 PM] Leah Shanker: and I don't want to bug you every time there's a module update
[03/01/2009 03:14:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: you open the page, right click each link and click copy hyperlink and open a shell to it and click paste after sudo wget
[03/01/2009 03:14:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just did a cd into /var/www/cms/sites/all/modules/
[03/01/2009 03:14:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and ran wget from there
[03/01/2009 03:14:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: piece of cake
[03/01/2009 03:14:53 PM] Leah Shanker: you know what's easier?
[03/01/2009 03:14:58 PM] Leah Shanker: doing absolutely nothing :)
[03/01/2009 03:15:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: not spending hours on a perl script
[03/01/2009 03:15:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: it took me less then a minute, i can do it from now on if it is so hard for you :-P
[03/01/2009 03:15:28 PM] Leah Shanker: we're more likely to have an up-to-date webpage if it updates every day
[03/01/2009 03:15:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was thinking you could make the big banner either a smaller font or only on the front page
[03/01/2009 03:16:14 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, talbert mentioned that
[03/01/2009 03:16:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it takes up half the page and when i was using it in the acm room i didn't even realize it was changed pages when i clicked on links because all i saw was the banner
[03/01/2009 03:16:31 PM] Leah Shanker: yes yes, I'm working on that
[03/01/2009 03:16:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[03/01/2009 03:16:41 PM] Leah Shanker: basically, there is a way that users can disable that blue banner
[03/01/2009 03:16:55 PM] Leah Shanker: and I haven't figured out how to allow that on the frontend yet
[03/01/2009 03:16:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think the font should just be smaller
[03/01/2009 03:17:16 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah, and maybe only the top 3 things for each category
[03/01/2009 03:17:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that might require some editing
[03/01/2009 03:17:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, and every drupal forum says don't mess with the php.
[03/01/2009 03:17:44 PM] Leah Shanker: because it's generated anyway
[03/01/2009 03:17:53 PM] Leah Shanker: which means at every update, you'll need to make the same change.
[03/01/2009 03:18:25 PM] Leah Shanker: so I'm still researching it, but I don't think it's the most important thing on my list right now
[03/01/2009 03:20:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, i'd just add a stylesheet, there must be an option for it in the module
[03/01/2009 03:21:16 PM] Leah Shanker: probably, under templates

[04/05/2009 11:13:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: I really think we should do some kind of free for all night at ACM
[04/05/2009 11:13:56 PM] Leah Shanker: we did on thursday
[04/05/2009 11:15:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: not really...  We just ended up doing ACM stuff and then the movie, maybe i have to agree with Ben or some of the others, something semi-formal, with still open to anyone
[04/05/2009 11:18:33 PM] Leah Shanker: next week is lockpicking
[04/05/2009 11:18:41 PM] Leah Shanker: this is a perfect opportunity for the workshop idea
[04/05/2009 11:18:55 PM] Leah Shanker: btw, what is the deal with the calendar?
[04/05/2009 11:19:05 PM] Leah Shanker: I saw it was all disabled
[04/05/2009 11:21:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: was like that when i got there, not sure, maybe we should reinstall, but if i do it i will be thorough, i am thinking backing up the database, remove everything, reinstalling, and copying the content over.  That would only take me a few hours, my convern is this; where did we go wrong and how do we prevent it from happening in the future?  obviously the actual server settings would not have to be redone, so ommit the amout of time we spent on that.
[04/05/2009 11:26:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did have to re-enable the CCK stuff, could that have anything to do with it?
[04/05/2009 11:27:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Well, ok
[04/05/2009 11:27:17 PM] Leah Shanker: the whole site-breaking-thing
[04/05/2009 11:27:22 PM] Leah Shanker: was because I disabled CCK
[04/05/2009 11:27:28 PM] Leah Shanker: obviously, let's not do that anymore.
[04/05/2009 11:27:45 PM] Leah Shanker: But the calendar module, cron, updates, etc
[04/05/2009 11:27:48 PM] Leah Shanker: *never* worked.
[04/05/2009 11:28:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, understandable
[04/05/2009 11:28:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will put Date back on there now
[04/05/2009 11:28:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so, let's try to get the calendar back up this week, then we will deal the cron
[04/05/2009 11:28:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you free tomorrow at all?
[04/05/2009 11:29:23 PM] Leah Shanker: hmm
[04/05/2009 11:29:33 PM] Leah Shanker: maybe - all our packages should be coming in tomorrow
[04/05/2009 11:29:42 PM] Leah Shanker: for robotics & digital carnival
[04/05/2009 11:29:52 PM] Leah Shanker: so I may be busy, but I'll definitely be around.
[04/05/2009 11:33:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so obviously the calendar link is pointing to a node that doesn't exist anymore
[04/05/2009 11:34:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: you've already done this before, so could you set it up easily, or should i try to figure out how to do it?
[04/05/2009 11:34:28 PM] Leah Shanker: reinstall the calendar?
[04/05/2009 11:34:33 PM] Leah Shanker: yeah i can do that
[04/05/2009 11:34:37 PM] Leah Shanker: not tonight though
[04/05/2009 11:34:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: at this point i wouldn't worry about past events, just set up a blank slate
[04/05/2009 11:34:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/05/2009 11:34:50 PM] Leah Shanker: i'll put it on my list for tomorrow
[04/05/2009 11:35:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok great
[04/05/2009 11:35:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i can mess around with cron asap

[04/05/2009 11:44:33 PM] Leah Shanker: guess they pegged you in some great marketing data mining :P
[04/05/2009 11:45:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, i watch this movie all the time and i don't use an anti-virus
[04/05/2009 11:46:07 PM] Leah Shanker: you do enough torrenting to warrant it.
[04/05/2009 11:46:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: to much overhead, anti-spyware is all that is really necessary these days

[04/05/2009 11:47:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Just download bitdefender, it's low maintenance
[04/05/2009 11:47:04 PM] Leah Shanker: not a lot of resources

[04/19/2009 06:23:26 PM] Leah Shanker: the one with the fanny pack
[04/19/2009 06:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't see anyone wearing a fanny pack

[04/19/2009 06:24:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know who you are talking about now
[04/19/2009 06:26:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: am i the only one who wasn't interested in anything steve jacobs had to say and think they are way overdoing themselves with trying to get us to look at the content and care about it?
[04/19/2009 06:27:12 PM] Leah Shanker: I didn't look at the videos yet, but I think he's overall pretty interesting
[04/19/2009 06:27:14 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean really
[04/19/2009 06:27:20 PM] Leah Shanker: Eck is just pretending to have experience.

[04/19/2009 06:28:06 PM] Leah Shanker: He really has no idea - Steve Jacobs actually has a lot more experience
[04/19/2009 06:28:06 PM] Leah Shanker: He's not as interesting to listen to, but I feel like if I sat down with him

[04/21/2009 12:16:16 AM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I'm working on it.
[04/21/2009 12:16:20 AM] Leah Shanker: I need the surveys taken care of
[04/21/2009 12:16:23 AM] Leah Shanker: I don't have time for both
[04/21/2009 12:16:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: or should i edit the functional spec?
[04/21/2009 12:16:41 AM] Leah Shanker: surveymonkey's the best option
[04/21/2009 12:17:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: Carl said he would modify the surveys did that not get done?  Who is going to fill out a survey at this time of night?
[04/21/2009 12:17:01 AM] Leah Shanker: we can post it now and people have tonight and tomorrow morning to reply
[04/21/2009 12:17:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: did Carl modify it?
[04/21/2009 12:17:35 AM] Leah Shanker: no, I don't see any changes
[04/21/2009 12:17:42 AM] Leah Shanker: same survey as last time
[04/21/2009 12:17:52 AM] Leah Shanker: his document is updated to reflect the new user target
[04/21/2009 12:17:57 AM] Leah Shanker: we still have no surveys
[04/21/2009 12:18:06 AM] Leah Shanker: which is why we were granted the extension in the first place
[04/21/2009 12:21:11 AM] Leah Shanker: anyway I'm heading home now, we'll talk later
[04/21/2009 12:21:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's not really going to help to post the same survey
[04/21/2009 12:22:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: we won't be getting any different result
[04/21/2009 12:22:13 AM] Leah Shanker: exactly
[04/21/2009 12:22:18 AM] Leah Shanker: which is why I asked you to create a new one
[04/21/2009 12:22:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i don't really appreciate you putting this on me
[04/21/2009 12:22:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: thursday afternoon we talked about create a new survey
[04/21/2009 12:22:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: Carl said he was going to do it if after class
[04/21/2009 12:23:09 AM] Leah Shanker: no, he said he was going to do the user profile
[04/21/2009 12:23:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand the misunderstanding, the evidence seems pretty solid
[04/21/2009 12:23:25 AM] Leah Shanker: there are two separate things:
[04/21/2009 12:23:28 AM] Leah Shanker: 1. new survey
[04/21/2009 12:23:36 AM] Leah Shanker: 2. "User Profile" section of the design review
[04/21/2009 12:24:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: yes user profile was his original responsibility for the report, just like mine was functional spec, and i remember Carl saying that he would go over the survey and make changes
[04/21/2009 12:24:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: if that didn't happen, then he didn't do his part
[04/21/2009 12:24:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have any recollection of you asking my to create a new survey, the survey has always been his thing
[04/21/2009 12:24:56 AM] Leah Shanker: Ok, no use worrying about it now
[04/21/2009 12:25:04 AM] Leah Shanker: no, I asked you on friday
[04/21/2009 12:25:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: he created the first one, and he has made all the changes to it since
[04/21/2009 12:25:17 AM] Leah Shanker: I said, "You know, we really need to get on the surveys. Could you take care of that please?"
[04/21/2009 12:26:04 AM] Leah Shanker: listen
[04/21/2009 12:26:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: well, i don't remember it, but if that's how it happened, why are we waiting until now to figure out that it didn't get done?
[04/21/2009 12:26:18 AM] Leah Shanker: there's no point in dwelling
[04/21/2009 12:26:37 AM] Leah Shanker: Because I had assumed it was taken care of.
[04/21/2009 12:26:46 AM] Leah Shanker: Urgent task: get survey up.
[04/21/2009 12:26:50 AM] Leah Shanker: Jarid's also online

[04/21/2009 01:03:30 AM] Brian Cullinan: but at least we will have some data points to use for the report soon
[04/21/2009 01:03:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: and jarid didn't accept my adding yet

[04/21/2009 01:05:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i have potentially 5 people filling it out now
[04/21/2009 01:05:59 AM] Leah Shanker: on surveymonkey?
[04/21/2009 01:06:01 AM] Leah Shanker: or on paper?

[04/21/2009 04:21:12 PM] Leah Shanker: wtf
[04/21/2009 04:22:11 PM] Leah Shanker: So we have a totally useless design packet turned in now.
[04/21/2009 04:22:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Which he will shit all over because it is the same data from last time.
[04/21/2009 04:22:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: we never turned it in last time
[04/21/2009 04:22:50 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean the Design Plan
[04/21/2009 04:23:01 PM] Leah Shanker: we told him straight out at the presentation that we have new data
[04/21/2009 04:25:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: there was a section explaining the change in our design, and there was the new chores section in the functional spec
[04/21/2009 04:25:59 PM] Leah Shanker: but our survey data is the SAME
[04/21/2009 04:27:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, starting on it at 11 o'clock the day before it is due is a little late
[04/21/2009 04:27:18 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey I got survey data!
[04/21/2009 04:27:24 PM] Leah Shanker: people actually answered it
[04/21/2009 04:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: great, how was that relayed to us before it was due?
[04/21/2009 04:27:45 PM] Leah Shanker: all you people had to do was fill in the blanks!
[04/21/2009 04:27:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: using what software?
[04/21/2009 04:28:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: you posted a PDF
[04/21/2009 04:28:07 PM] Leah Shanker: USING SURVEYMONKEY
[04/21/2009 04:28:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, so how were we supposed to change the report you posted?
[04/21/2009 04:28:33 PM] Leah Shanker: You can change pdfs with acrobat
[04/21/2009 04:28:37 PM] Leah Shanker: also with openoffice
[04/21/2009 04:29:06 PM] Leah Shanker: no one bothered to call?
[04/21/2009 04:29:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just not sure what you expected to happen
[04/21/2009 04:30:14 PM] Leah Shanker: I wrote it up in the email
[04/21/2009 04:30:20 PM] Leah Shanker: I gave each of you specific tasks...
[04/21/2009 04:31:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: you submitted a pdf, using fonts and formats specific to Mac, none of us had open office and i don't believe that the formats transfer over, luckily i have acrobat pro but the only editing i was able to do was remove objects
[04/21/2009 04:31:33 PM] Leah Shanker: All I needed was text submissions!
[04/21/2009 04:32:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Which aren't done anyway it seems?
[04/21/2009 04:32:18 PM] Leah Shanker: In fact RIGHT NOW I could submit a revision!
[04/21/2009 04:33:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: like i said, we had all weekend to get this done, and once again everyone waiting until the last minute, so if there is a problem with that then the best thing to do is change yourself, don't pass the irresponsibility on to others
[04/21/2009 04:33:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: *waited
[04/21/2009 04:33:41 PM] Leah Shanker: THAT IS WHY I TOLD YOU TO DO THE SURVEY ON FRIDAY

[04/21/2009 04:34:03 PM] Leah Shanker: they weren't new things I threw at you
[04/21/2009 04:34:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't remember the conversation on friday, but obviously you are convinced it happened, so why did you wait until 11 last night to find out it wasn't done?
[04/21/2009 04:35:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: why did you wait until last night after everyone got offline to send an email of new tasks?
[04/21/2009 04:35:31 PM] Leah Shanker: THEY WERENT NEW
[04/21/2009 04:35:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: why didn't you submit the survey in a format that we could all use and edit?
[04/21/2009 04:35:53 PM] Leah Shanker: YOU CAN EDIT THE SURVEYMONKEY SURVEY
[04/21/2009 04:36:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: 7:25 AM i recieved and email that instructed us to go to the site and see the new "urgent items"
[04/21/2009 04:36:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am talking about the report not the surveys
[04/21/2009 04:36:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Exactly. I figured you would create paragraphs in between linear and UI
[04/21/2009 04:37:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you were up ready to put together the new information before UI?
[04/21/2009 04:37:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: seems like you are just as guilty of not contacting anyone
[04/21/2009 04:38:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: this whole weekend, and today
[04/21/2009 04:38:10 PM] Leah Shanker: YES I WAS SLEEPING
[04/21/2009 04:38:19 PM] Leah Shanker: I figured you all were responsible enough to handle it
[04/21/2009 04:38:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you were sleeping
[04/21/2009 04:38:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you posted a report that no one could modify but you
[04/21/2009 04:38:44 PM] Leah Shanker: Obviously you wan
[04/21/2009 04:38:45 PM] Leah Shanker: can*
[04/21/2009 04:38:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you expected us to all come up with new content
[04/21/2009 04:39:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Uh huh....one or two paragraphs of text.
[04/21/2009 04:39:09 PM] Leah Shanker: not hard!
[04/21/2009 04:39:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already told you, i couldn't edit text with acrobat, it gave me errors
[04/21/2009 04:39:13 PM] Leah Shanker: I did all the hard work anyway!
[04/21/2009 04:39:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: so how did you expect this to all come together last minute?
[04/21/2009 04:39:34 PM] Leah Shanker: Each of you would submit text paragraphs
[04/21/2009 04:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i am not explaining this right
[04/21/2009 04:39:41 PM] Leah Shanker: I would add this to the report, print it and submit it
[04/21/2009 04:39:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you were sleeping?
[04/21/2009 04:39:59 PM] Leah Shanker: I woke up before UI
[04/21/2009 04:40:07 PM] Leah Shanker: and saw nobody had submitted anything to add
[04/21/2009 04:40:10 PM] Leah Shanker: and went back to sleep.
[04/21/2009 04:40:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh

[04/21/2009 04:42:09 PM] Leah Shanker: I even referred you all to pages in the Kaffeine document so you could match it...
[04/21/2009 04:42:15 PM] Leah Shanker: and now we have a totally useless submission.
[04/21/2009 04:42:29 PM] Leah Shanker: FUCK IT. I have to do everything.
[04/21/2009 04:43:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's not at all what you should take from this
[04/21/2009 04:43:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: how about, you have to make sure everything gets done
[04/21/2009 04:43:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's part of the responsibility of team lead
[04/21/2009 04:43:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, and I did.
[04/21/2009 04:43:52 PM] Leah Shanker: at 7am this morning I sent out an OMFG DO YOUR JOBS email
[04/21/2009 04:43:57 PM] Leah Shanker: and no one did apparently.
[04/21/2009 04:44:05 PM] Leah Shanker: We had hours and hours to change it
[04/21/2009 04:44:13 PM] Leah Shanker: not hard for a few paragraphs
[04/21/2009 04:44:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry i don't consider 7am the day the project is due exactly on top of things
[04/21/2009 04:44:41 PM] Leah Shanker: This isn't new stuff.
[04/21/2009 04:44:45 PM] Leah Shanker: This was all discussed before.
[04/21/2009 04:44:52 PM] Leah Shanker: All the URGENT tasks were things you all had been slacking on.
[04/21/2009 04:45:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Stop being obtuse and fix your shit.
[04/21/2009 04:45:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you keep saying that, but it isn't really the point, the point is it didn't get done between last Thursday and yesterday.
[04/21/2009 04:46:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i did fix it, thank goodness i was able to remove stuff at least in the report, otherwise we would have had a report with a bunch of pink notes all over it
[04/21/2009 04:46:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have office 2008?
[04/21/2009 04:47:34 PM] Leah Shanker: No. make me some text changes.
[04/21/2009 04:47:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have 2004?
[04/21/2009 04:48:18 PM] Leah Shanker: NO Give it to me in text!
[04/21/2009 04:48:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to be able to function without Pages, and we all need to be able to make changes to the report
[04/21/2009 04:49:02 PM] Leah Shanker: THAT IS NOT IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
[04/21/2009 04:49:07 PM] Leah Shanker: GIVE ME A SUBMISSION
[04/21/2009 04:50:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already submitted changes, i incorporated Chores into the functional spec matching the format of the example report

[04/30/2009 03:58:07 PM] Leah Shanker: do you actually feel that way?
[04/30/2009 03:58:54 PM] Leah Shanker: in the email
[04/30/2009 03:59:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: I think it was a pretty shitty thing to do, i was going to just let it go and not participate in ACM anymore
[04/30/2009 04:00:09 PM] Leah Shanker: You really cared that much?
[04/30/2009 04:00:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: There are some people in positions that i think are completely wrong and not good for the club, so if my vote had counted would things be different?
[04/30/2009 04:01:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways we don't need to worry about this now, we should be focusing on schools, ACM is over until next semester and we can argue about it then
[04/30/2009 04:01:21 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh that's how I felt after last semester's votes
[04/30/2009 04:01:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i felt that way after last semester too
[04/30/2009 04:01:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: Rory didn't do shit
[04/30/2009 04:01:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we had this new system in place maybe it would have been different
[04/30/2009 04:02:15 PM] Leah Shanker: I also didn't appreciate the random committees created for girlfriends of past presidents...
[04/30/2009 04:02:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Who didn't do that job anyway
[04/30/2009 04:02:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just worry next semester isn't going to be any better
[04/30/2009 04:03:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i think we do need someone to clean the room because the cleaning ladies don't do it, but the elected person never took a vacuum to it, it had a good intention it was poorly executed
[04/30/2009 04:03:49 PM] Leah Shanker: She never did anything.
[04/30/2009 04:04:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Not *any* type of cleaning or organizing or anything
[04/30/2009 04:04:12 PM] Leah Shanker: and I want to say she's not an Engineering major
[04/30/2009 04:04:29 PM] Leah Shanker: but Meaghan has proved that she loves computers even though she's not majoring in it
[04/30/2009 04:04:37 PM] Leah Shanker: BUT JESSICA DOESNT EVEN LIKE TECH
[04/30/2009 04:05:17 PM] Leah Shanker: It really seems like she's just David's girlfriend and only comes by when he's here.
[04/30/2009 04:06:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think he wanted more people to participate in officer meetings, and by allowing other people to participate optionally similar to a "board" meeting where issues can be presented by non-board members solves the problem of appearing elitist and being in the special group of people that get to make decisions, so there is no more need for past-president-girlfriend positions
[04/30/2009 04:07:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think there is a draw to the community, you don't have to get into the interworkings of computers to want to be around people that know a lot about them
[04/30/2009 04:07:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's a good community of people to be apart of
[04/30/2009 04:07:55 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, her friends hang out there. I get it.
[04/30/2009 04:08:02 PM] Leah Shanker: But that's not what we want in an officer.
[04/30/2009 04:08:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats true
[04/30/2009 04:08:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that why david and my vote was excluded?
[04/30/2009 04:08:37 PM] Leah Shanker: Absolutely not
[04/30/2009 04:08:42 PM] Leah Shanker: I was just ranting.
[04/30/2009 04:08:52 PM] Leah Shanker: The reason your vote was discounted was because of the cirucmstance
[04/30/2009 04:09:06 PM] Leah Shanker: Here's how it happened form our angle
[04/30/2009 04:09:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Two people, including another officer, weren't at the meeting but left proxy votes in writing with an officer before leaving.
[04/30/2009 04:11:20 PM] Leah Shanker: what did you miss?
[04/30/2009 04:12:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i only got votes in writing with an officer before leaving
[04/30/2009 04:12:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you mean to send something after that?
[04/30/2009 04:14:02 PM] Leah Shanker: so ok
[04/30/2009 04:14:11 PM] Leah Shanker:  When we were voting for treasurer (Jessica was on that list of candidates), someone noticed Jessica put in three ballots
[04/30/2009 04:14:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so just to be clear here, the basis for the argument is WHEN the votes were submitted
[04/30/2009 04:14:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: other people submit proxy votes before they left
[04/30/2009 04:14:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: correct?  other people not me and david, that couldn't be there?
[04/30/2009 04:15:18 PM] Leah Shanker: no no
[04/30/2009 04:15:19 PM] Leah Shanker: let me finish
[04/30/2009 04:15:32 PM] Leah Shanker: So, someone noticed she was putting in three votes.
[04/30/2009 04:15:53 PM] Leah Shanker: It was brought to my attention, she said she was on the phone with David and you from Vegas and you were giving her your votes
[04/30/2009 04:16:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok makes sense
[04/30/2009 04:16:49 PM] Leah Shanker: Obviously, Jessica - who was running for the position in question - was taking down your votes.
[04/30/2009 04:17:04 PM] Leah Shanker: Obviously shady, not going to be allowed.
[04/30/2009 04:17:12 PM] Leah Shanker: She protested, so we put it to a vote.
[04/30/2009 04:17:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: so delegate someone else to take the proxy votes
[04/30/2009 04:18:19 PM] Leah Shanker: Here's the way we saw it: she calls up David, who wasn't at the election and didn't even notify us he was going to be missing and wanted to vote, and you happen to be there.
[04/30/2009 04:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: so a waiver that is good enough for the university, isn't good enough for ACM
[04/30/2009 04:18:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok lets go with it
[04/30/2009 04:18:59 PM] Leah Shanker: Hey a waiver doesn't notify us ahead of time.
[04/30/2009 04:19:18 PM] Leah Shanker: A simple "Hey, I'm leaving for vegas. Gonna miss the meeting" casually thrown out at the acm lounge...
[04/30/2009 04:20:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, obviously it seems like you really do feel like David says you do.
[04/30/2009 04:20:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not just about me
[04/30/2009 04:20:55 PM] Leah Shanker: And I'm really sorry that happened to you: the club was in major transition.
[04/30/2009 04:20:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so let's look at a broader perspective, ACM is a student organized club that has grown beautifully in the last two to three years
[04/30/2009 04:21:31 PM] Leah Shanker: We totally rewrote the constitution right before the elections, decided on a voting method the day of...
[04/30/2009 04:21:38 PM] Leah Shanker: things were hectic and not set in stone yet.
[04/30/2009 04:21:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it comes down to the very basic fact, if you want a good club don't to not-good things to people in it
[04/30/2009 04:22:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Like unfairly call up your boyfriend who's not at the meeting to get votes in your favor.
[04/30/2009 04:22:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: it could have just as easily been stated that "From now on we will elect someone not running for a position to take proxy votes" and then handed the phone to them and done the voting
[04/30/2009 04:23:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we chose the shitty handling it, which is argue to exclude people that honestly participated in the club for the last 2 years
[04/30/2009 04:23:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, here's how it works in a club
[04/30/2009 04:23:34 PM] Leah Shanker: You allow one person, even an officer, to publicly do something even remotely borderline shady
[04/30/2009 04:23:45 PM] Leah Shanker: and you've opened the floodgates.
[04/30/2009 04:23:56 PM] Leah Shanker: And that's simply because it was a public spectacle.
[04/30/2009 04:24:03 PM] Leah Shanker: You know I would happily bend the rules for you anytime.
[04/30/2009 04:24:21 PM] Leah Shanker: As long as it's not during the public events...
[04/30/2009 04:25:24 PM] Leah Shanker: Which is why I was so angry with you for the head crab hat thing.
[04/30/2009 04:25:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: All i am saying is, there was a better way to handle this, someone has to count the ballots right?  who is to say they won't switch around the numbers?  give the phone to that person to add our votes.
[04/30/2009 04:25:56 PM] Leah Shanker: There were three officers counting the votes including me.
[04/30/2009 04:26:14 PM] Leah Shanker: Some of them were running for positions, but at least one of them wasn't and was right there watching.
[04/30/2009 04:26:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: And you can't really use that argument against me anymore, i fooled around to be amusing, and i ended up winning with my original raffle ticket anyways
[04/30/2009 04:27:00 PM] Leah Shanker: I know, that's why it was so funny.
[04/30/2009 04:27:21 PM] Leah Shanker: But you got caught!
[04/30/2009 04:27:36 PM] Leah Shanker: You didn't come forward.
[04/30/2009 04:28:11 PM] Leah Shanker: If it was truly just an amusing thing, you would have come forward, said it out loud to be funny and then retrieved your tickets.
[04/30/2009 04:28:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Though I wasn't there, so I really have no idea.
[04/30/2009 04:28:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: getting caught was part of the fun, i wasn't trying to hide it from Forrest (the one who caught me), i was just fooling around, i didn't negatively affect anyone else's chances at winning
[04/30/2009 04:29:25 PM] Leah Shanker: But you do understand my point about the image it projects?
[04/30/2009 04:29:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: well when you announce it out loud and make a big deal about it sure
[04/30/2009 04:30:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: everyone who knew about it before that, knew i was just screweing around
[04/30/2009 04:30:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: this election on the other hand negatively affected david and my experience with the club
[04/30/2009 04:30:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: you need to learn to pick your battles
[04/30/2009 04:30:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh I did.
[04/30/2009 04:30:43 PM] Leah Shanker: And I picked this one.
[04/30/2009 04:30:50 PM] Leah Shanker: This is a big issues.
[04/30/2009 04:31:02 PM] Leah Shanker: Trust me, I let a lot of things slide.
[04/30/2009 04:31:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Shady voting behavior is not one of those things.
[04/30/2009 04:31:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: No, you made it look shady
[04/30/2009 04:31:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got this idea in your head that it was a malicious act
[04/30/2009 04:31:48 PM] Leah Shanker: Especially since some our officers have dropped off the face of the earth.
[04/30/2009 04:32:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and instead of handling it appropriately, you decided to hurt my feelings and daves feelings
[04/30/2009 04:32:07 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm especially vested in electing good, solid, honest officers.
[04/30/2009 04:32:28 PM] Leah Shanker: That can't happen with borderline shady methods of getting there.
[04/30/2009 04:32:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: there were dozens of ways it could have been handled to make it fair, and you chose the shittiest possible solution
[04/30/2009 04:33:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Everything I did, it wasn't to hurt your feelings.
[04/30/2009 04:33:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am not saying this isn't a battle you shouldn't have picked, that was referring to the little raffle
[04/30/2009 04:34:07 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, and that's why I let it go!
[04/30/2009 04:34:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you couldn't just put dave and I on speaker phone when the 3 of you were counting ballots?
[04/30/2009 04:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's not an easy enough solution?
[04/30/2009 04:34:26 PM] Leah Shanker: I thought about that afterward
[04/30/2009 04:34:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that not a solution?
[04/30/2009 04:34:31 PM] Leah Shanker: That would have been a perfect solution
[04/30/2009 04:34:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well there you go
[04/30/2009 04:34:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: get we should have thought of it sooner
[04/30/2009 04:35:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: *guess
[04/30/2009 04:35:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, definitely.
[04/30/2009 04:35:44 PM] Leah Shanker: And I don't really like the idea of people submitting votes before hearing the speakers
[04/30/2009 04:35:55 PM] Leah Shanker: I came into the elections knowing exactly who I wanted to win
[04/30/2009 04:36:03 PM] Leah Shanker: and then heard the speeches and was completely swayed.
[04/30/2009 04:36:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: the problem with submitting votes early is also the fact that nominations are open until voting day
[04/30/2009 04:36:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: so had dave and i submitted before we left there was still the chance that the nominees could change
[04/30/2009 04:37:11 PM] Leah Shanker: And they did: one person was added to one position.
[04/30/2009 04:37:16 PM] Leah Shanker: But you know, not by much.
[04/30/2009 04:37:29 PM] Leah Shanker: I think hearing the speeches was a bigger variable, myself.
[04/30/2009 04:39:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when elections roll around again, we should make it clear that people can phone a friend and submit their remote votes to the "counters"
[04/30/2009 04:40:31 PM] Leah Shanker: no no no
[04/30/2009 04:40:39 PM] Leah Shanker: That's not a door we want to open
[04/30/2009 04:40:45 PM] Leah Shanker: What I'm suggesting
[04/30/2009 04:40:50 PM] Leah Shanker: A video conference
[04/30/2009 04:41:02 PM] Leah Shanker: using the webcam, mics & speakers
[04/30/2009 04:41:45 PM] Leah Shanker: and I suppose since you guys were on the road, that means each of you would call in and be put on speaker
[04/30/2009 04:42:08 PM] Leah Shanker: so you would be able to hear each candidate speak and then cast your vote
[04/30/2009 04:42:20 PM] Leah Shanker: anyway, we can talk about this later.

[05/04/2009 06:33:47 PM] Leah Shanker: Also for functional, we need a "completion level" for each

[05/10/2009 04:32:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish there were more sexy blonde PI chicks around me
[05/10/2009 04:32:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry life's so hard :(
[05/10/2009 04:32:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know right
[05/10/2009 04:32:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: life is messed up
[05/10/2009 04:34:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: veronica is so broken!
[05/10/2009 04:34:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: *tear*
[05/10/2009 04:36:42 PM] Leah Shanker: You know, your fascination with broken chicks is the one thing that will ensure your unhappiness.
[05/10/2009 04:37:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it makes me happy
[05/10/2009 04:37:10 PM] Leah Shanker: unhappiness makes you happy?
[05/10/2009 04:37:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: broken chicks make me happy
[05/10/2009 04:37:45 PM] Leah Shanker: But all I hear about from you is how broken chicks lie to you and betray you and stray...
[05/10/2009 04:37:52 PM] Leah Shanker: and how *unhappy* that makes you.
[05/10/2009 04:38:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm...
[05/10/2009 04:38:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: people have a habit on focusing on the bad things
[05/10/2009 04:39:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's all you hear because that's most of what i tell you
[05/10/2009 04:39:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it's most of what i tell you because it's long distance
[05/10/2009 04:39:33 PM] Leah Shanker: Trust me, Brian. I thought I could fix the broken ones too.
[05/10/2009 04:39:38 PM] Leah Shanker: We're all guilty of that.
[05/10/2009 04:40:00 PM] Leah Shanker: It's not all bad - in fact, when it's good: I'd argue that it was even better than in a normal healthy relationship.
[05/10/2009 04:40:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not trying to fix anyone, i just joke around
[05/10/2009 04:40:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry, I'm in a weird place. I'm super serious today or something.
[05/10/2009 04:40:58 PM] Leah Shanker: Go ahead, I set you up for it anyway...
[05/10/2009 04:41:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: uhhh
[05/10/2009 04:41:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Ask
[05/10/2009 04:41:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: what's up?
[05/10/2009 04:41:36 PM] Leah Shanker: !
[05/10/2009 04:41:43 PM] Leah Shanker: You missed your chance!
[05/10/2009 04:41:48 PM] Leah Shanker: Y so Serious?
[05/10/2009 04:41:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/10/2009 04:41:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[05/10/2009 04:42:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: well?  y so srs?
[05/10/2009 04:43:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Dunno, couldn't say really. Just sort of living in the past today.
[05/10/2009 04:43:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/10/2009 04:44:05 PM] Leah Shanker: You going to the BBQ?
[05/10/2009 04:44:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: BBQ?
[05/10/2009 04:44:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: where?
[05/10/2009 04:44:36 PM] Leah Shanker: At Shermans - I guess it's kind of an EE thing.
[05/10/2009 04:44:54 PM] Leah Shanker: I had just assumed since you had been talking to him at Joes the other day
[05/10/2009 04:45:01 PM] Leah Shanker: Sorry
[05/10/2009 04:45:32 PM] Leah Shanker: It sounds boring anyway, I'll probably stay home.
[05/10/2009 04:45:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh huh
[05/10/2009 04:45:38 PM] Leah Shanker: I'll know like one or two people ther.
[05/10/2009 04:45:44 PM] Leah Shanker: there*
[05/10/2009 04:45:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: well tell the douche bag to give all the LEDs back
[05/10/2009 04:46:01 PM] Leah Shanker: that wasn't him!
[05/10/2009 04:46:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know it wasn't sherman
[05/10/2009 04:46:16 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh yeah, big garrett.
[05/10/2009 04:46:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean if the guy that took them is there
[05/10/2009 04:46:26 PM] Leah Shanker: I'll ask him about it if I end up going
[05/10/2009 04:46:41 PM] Leah Shanker: MAN
[05/10/2009 04:46:45 PM] Leah Shanker: there was this one guy at Joes
[05/10/2009 04:46:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't find him to be interesting at all
[05/10/2009 04:46:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: the red headed guy?
[05/10/2009 04:46:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: at joes?
[05/10/2009 04:47:00 PM] Leah Shanker: Who, Sherman?
[05/10/2009 04:47:08 PM] Leah Shanker: You go first
[05/10/2009 04:47:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: no big garret, i didn't find him to be interesting at all, that's all i was going to say
[05/10/2009 04:47:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was querying about the guy you were talking about at joes
[05/10/2009 04:47:45 PM] Leah Shanker: Aside from being a huge beefcake, he's actually a very nice guy
[05/10/2009 04:47:56 PM] Leah Shanker: He's an introvert, you have to kind of get him alone to get him to open up
[05/10/2009 04:48:05 PM] Leah Shanker: he was helping me with one of my circuits once
[05/10/2009 04:48:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[05/10/2009 04:48:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i guess i'll give him another chance
[05/10/2009 04:48:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: what were you going to say about some guy at joes
[05/10/2009 04:48:42 PM] Leah Shanker: Honestly, he couldn't have known they were yours
[05/10/2009 04:49:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Oh so two guys then
[05/10/2009 04:49:18 PM] Leah Shanker: the redheaded guy who kind of cornered me and forced himself upon me.
[05/10/2009 04:49:29 PM] Leah Shanker: Feels like that anyway, he was bombarding me with boring stuff.
[05/10/2009 04:49:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/10/2009 04:49:46 PM] Leah Shanker: But overall, he's just kind of nerdy.
[05/10/2009 04:49:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: we was pretty square
[05/10/2009 04:49:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Which never tends to rub me the wrong way.
[05/10/2009 04:49:59 PM] Leah Shanker: The guy who did get on my nerves
[05/10/2009 04:50:05 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok so like
[05/10/2009 04:50:14 PM] Leah Shanker: I was talking with Sherman about one of his programming projects
[05/10/2009 04:50:26 PM] Leah Shanker: And he was amazed that gcc had been able to compile his C++ code
[05/10/2009 04:50:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/10/2009 04:50:44 PM] Leah Shanker: So I was explaining the history, that C is a subset of C++ and gcc is actually a collection of language compilers.
[05/10/2009 04:50:59 PM] Leah Shanker: And this guy from like ACROSS THE ENTIRE ROOM
[05/10/2009 04:51:22 PM] Leah Shanker: was like "Oh god Don't get Me STARTED ON gcc"
[05/10/2009 04:51:30 PM] Leah Shanker: and then pretty much repeated what I had just said, very angrily.
[05/10/2009 04:51:43 PM] Leah Shanker: And it was like - I wasn't really getting you started on anything...
[05/10/2009 04:51:50 PM] Leah Shanker: In fact, who the fuck are you?
[05/10/2009 04:52:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[05/10/2009 04:52:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/10/2009 04:52:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand why people get angry people of what computers do
[05/10/2009 04:52:30 PM] Leah Shanker: Seriously!
[05/10/2009 04:52:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: someone else 10 times smarter then them made it do that
[05/10/2009 04:52:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: for a good reason
[05/10/2009 04:52:46 PM] Leah Shanker: He's like one of those annoying guys who really just needs to spend enough time at ACM before they're a passable human being.
[05/10/2009 04:52:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe not always the right one
[05/10/2009 04:53:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Exactly!
[05/10/2009 04:53:16 PM] Leah Shanker: I mean, I am part David Smith in some ways.
[05/10/2009 04:53:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol maraschino cherries totally count as fruit
[05/10/2009 04:53:33 PM] Leah Shanker: They do :)
[05/10/2009 04:53:45 PM] Leah Shanker: They're cherries. coated in syrup. But still real fruit.
[05/10/2009 04:53:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: totally
[05/10/2009 04:53:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: how are you part David Smith?
[05/10/2009 04:54:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I flout the rules whenever I truly disagree with them.
[05/10/2009 04:54:32 PM] Leah Shanker: But unlike him, I have a basic respect for established principles.
[05/10/2009 04:54:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[05/10/2009 04:54:56 PM] Leah Shanker: Rules are in place for a reason: to keep people working well in a system.
[05/10/2009 04:55:12 PM] Leah Shanker: Sometimes there are rules that get by that are truly ridiculous and I disagree with them entirely...
[05/10/2009 04:55:36 PM] Leah Shanker: but for the most part, TONS of people have come to the agreement that this is the established "right" way of doing things.
[05/10/2009 04:55:41 PM] Leah Shanker: Mind you, I'm not a Dr. Palmer either
[05/10/2009 04:55:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: david agrees with what david likes, regardless of rules
[05/10/2009 04:55:56 PM] Leah Shanker: where I think no matter what new evidence comes up, the rules are always right.
[05/10/2009 04:56:09 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, that's where he and I tend to clash.
[05/10/2009 04:56:31 PM] Leah Shanker: He thinks he's just one big walking exception to the rules.
[05/10/2009 04:56:43 PM] Leah Shanker: Which is part of his charm, to be sure.
[05/10/2009 04:56:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, he abides to the ones he feels is right
[05/10/2009 04:57:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: *are right
[05/10/2009 04:57:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh!
[05/10/2009 04:57:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: topic of discussion
[05/10/2009 04:57:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: why are you hesitant to me living with mike
[05/10/2009 04:57:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[05/10/2009 04:57:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've meant to ask you so long
[05/10/2009 04:58:13 PM] Leah Shanker: Obviously this doesn't get repeated.
[05/10/2009 04:58:23 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes?
[05/10/2009 04:59:17 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, nevermind then :)
[05/10/2009 04:59:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course not!
[05/10/2009 04:59:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry for the delay
[05/10/2009 04:59:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: what's up?  you can't just give me funny looks every time it comes up and not tell me.
[05/10/2009 04:59:54 PM] Leah Shanker: no biggie, just keep this to yourself.
[05/10/2009 04:59:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will
[05/10/2009 05:00:11 PM] Leah Shanker: So Mike is an extremely shady guy.
[05/10/2009 05:00:26 PM] Leah Shanker: Morally is sort of up for debate...
[05/10/2009 05:00:29 PM] Leah Shanker: but I mean
[05/10/2009 05:00:44 PM] Leah Shanker: He was an arms dealer for the Mexican Mafia
[05/10/2009 05:00:54 PM] Leah Shanker: He also sold 0-days on the black market
[05/10/2009 05:01:06 PM] Leah Shanker: He was my drug dealer back in the day
[05/10/2009 05:01:16 PM] Leah Shanker: As Meaghan tells me, still is.
[05/10/2009 05:01:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: an arms dealer?
[05/10/2009 05:01:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah: he's fucking hardcore.
[05/10/2009 05:01:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: smart guy
[05/10/2009 05:01:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Not so mart
[05/10/2009 05:01:54 PM] Leah Shanker: so smart*
[05/10/2009 05:01:56 PM] Leah Shanker: he's spent time in prison
[05/10/2009 05:02:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: he told me he went to jail, never heard about prison
[05/10/2009 05:02:28 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah: I think he got off of his charges because of some complication.
[05/10/2009 05:02:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/10/2009 05:02:37 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't know the full story
[05/10/2009 05:03:07 PM] Leah Shanker: So here's where I stand with this
[05/10/2009 05:03:38 PM] Leah Shanker: I deliberately separated myself from my old friends so I could make a clean break.
[05/10/2009 05:03:53 PM] Leah Shanker: Most of which showed up at your place for that one party.
[05/10/2009 05:04:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: which party?
[05/10/2009 05:04:43 PM] Leah Shanker: The party where Mike brought a bunch of his friends.
[05/10/2009 05:05:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you mean his birthday party?
[05/10/2009 05:05:31 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, I guess that was his birthday.
[05/10/2009 05:05:40 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't know if you notice this or not
[05/10/2009 05:05:52 PM] Leah Shanker: I guess it's kind of a takes-one-to-know-one sort of deal
[05/10/2009 05:06:01 PM] Leah Shanker: but almost every time I see Mike, he's on something.
[05/10/2009 05:06:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol yeah i know
[05/10/2009 05:06:14 PM] Leah Shanker: The times where he seems fine, it's noticable.
[05/10/2009 05:06:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not naive, i know mike pretty well based on his attitude towards thing
[05/10/2009 05:07:23 PM] Leah Shanker: So ok
[05/10/2009 05:07:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: *things
[05/10/2009 05:07:40 PM] Leah Shanker: I'm not going into all my old stories because that will just puts me in a weird place.
[05/10/2009 05:07:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know when he's high
[05/10/2009 05:07:44 PM] Leah Shanker: But here's a new one
[05/10/2009 05:07:56 PM] Leah Shanker: When we went down to Tucson for the programming competition
[05/10/2009 05:08:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh huh
[05/10/2009 05:08:15 PM] Leah Shanker: Me, Matt & Mike were all in a car together, Matt was driving
[05/10/2009 05:08:43 PM] Leah Shanker: On the way back up from Tucson, a cop was waiting in the middle section, Matt was semi-speeding
[05/10/2009 05:09:07 PM] Leah Shanker: I noticed the cop and told Matt, Matt was like "Crap, I was speeding a bit. Hope we don't get pulled over"
[05/10/2009 05:09:14 PM] Leah Shanker: And Mike announces that he's holding.
[05/10/2009 05:09:26 PM] Leah Shanker: This makes me roll my eyes a little, because I half expected it
[05/10/2009 05:09:32 PM] Leah Shanker: but this pisses Matt off to no end.
[05/10/2009 05:09:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[05/10/2009 05:09:50 PM] Leah Shanker: Even though he would be the one arrested for it if the shit hits the fan
[05/10/2009 05:10:01 PM] Leah Shanker: He's still putting Matt at risk, without letting any of us know.
[05/10/2009 05:10:47 PM] Leah Shanker: This isn't a big deal - nothing would have happened to us even if they found he was holding.
[05/10/2009 05:10:50 PM] Leah Shanker: us as in Me & Matt
[05/10/2009 05:10:59 PM] Leah Shanker: But what rubs me the wrong way
[05/10/2009 05:11:12 PM] Leah Shanker: is that he didn't even consult us, but put us at risk anyway.
[05/10/2009 05:11:45 PM] Leah Shanker: And if your place gets searched, he'll probably have drugs stashed somewhere
[05/10/2009 05:11:59 PM] Leah Shanker: which could mean consequences for you if your name is on the deed/lease.
[05/10/2009 05:12:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/10/2009 05:12:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll have to look up the laws on that
[05/10/2009 05:12:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we are renting to him and completely unaware
[05/10/2009 05:12:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: the people that own the place can't be held accountable, that would be shitty
[05/10/2009 05:13:04 PM] Leah Shanker: So I know in dorms anyway
[05/10/2009 05:13:17 PM] Leah Shanker: if drugs are found in a dorm, both roommates can be arrested for it.
[05/10/2009 05:13:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, but the hall manager isn't
[05/10/2009 05:13:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: !
[05/10/2009 05:14:01 PM] Leah Shanker: True, but that's not quite the same.
[05/10/2009 05:14:25 PM] Leah Shanker: Anyway, all I can tell you is look into it and watch yourself.
[05/10/2009 05:14:50 PM] Leah Shanker: And most likely I won't be hanging around there as much I normally do :(
[05/10/2009 05:15:23 PM] Leah Shanker: It's one of those things where I don't want to put myself in that situation anymore.
[05/10/2009 05:15:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you're clean now so whats the danger? afraid of a relapse?
[05/10/2009 05:15:53 PM] Leah Shanker: Yes, exactly.
[05/10/2009 05:16:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you remember how old michael is?
[05/10/2009 05:16:15 PM] Leah Shanker: My age, a little older.
[05/10/2009 05:16:19 PM] Leah Shanker: 23 or 24 I think
[05/10/2009 05:18:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/10/2009 05:19:44 PM] Leah Shanker: Why do you want Mike to live with you?
[05/10/2009 05:20:23 PM] Leah Shanker: You do know he's slept with Crystal, right?
[05/10/2009 05:20:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i think he will pay rent
[05/10/2009 05:21:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i know, it was a long time ago
[05/10/2009 05:22:02 PM] Leah Shanker: What, did mcdave not pay rent?
[05/10/2009 05:22:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: mcdave is moving out
[05/10/2009 05:22:35 PM] Leah Shanker: And I can think of a billion other people you could live with who would pay rent.
[05/10/2009 05:22:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah?
[05/10/2009 05:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't
[05/10/2009 05:23:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: most people i would live with already have a place, and it would only be for 3 months
[05/10/2009 05:23:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they would have to move in and out again
[05/10/2009 05:24:11 PM] Leah Shanker: I don't think living with a drug dealer would be a good move for you, Brian.
[05/10/2009 05:24:44 PM] Leah Shanker: You're already in a weird, depressed state. You could possibly end up not graduating, you know.
[05/10/2009 05:25:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, that implies so many things about the way you see me
[05/10/2009 05:25:32 PM] Leah Shanker: Correct me where I'm wrong:
[05/10/2009 05:26:16 PM] Leah Shanker: You've been depressed all semester - not caring about school, not caring about yourself, etc.
[05/10/2009 05:26:44 PM] Leah Shanker: You've been interested in dabbling in drugs before, even asked me for my contacts last year...
[05/10/2009 05:26:57 PM] Leah Shanker: You drink like a fish...
[05/10/2009 05:28:10 PM] Leah Shanker: All of these together doesn't really bode well for you, and I'm just a worried mommy.
[05/10/2009 05:29:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, i really don't drink as much as i say i do, like wednesday, i waiting all the way until 11 o clock to drink
[05/10/2009 05:29:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and being depressed was a side affect of being long distance, something that won't be a factor this summer
[05/10/2009 05:30:03 PM] Leah Shanker: Crystal's coming here?
[05/10/2009 05:30:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i would do weed, but rarely, and only because it should be legalized anyways
[05/10/2009 05:31:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: Crystal and I are spending the whole summer together, aside from me being out of state/country
[05/10/2009 05:31:23 PM] Leah Shanker: So she and Mike will be living with you in the same place?
[05/10/2009 05:31:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/10/2009 05:31:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: well no
[05/10/2009 05:31:46 PM] Leah Shanker: So that's another reason for me to worry...
[05/10/2009 05:31:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: she will be living with me, and mike will be in the same place
[05/10/2009 05:32:15 PM] Leah Shanker: You know she has a history too.
[05/10/2009 05:32:29 PM] Leah Shanker: In fact, it goes way deeper for her than it ever did for me.
[05/10/2009 05:32:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know all about her history
[05/10/2009 05:33:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she avoid weed like the plague, she doesn't like it when i do it
[05/10/2009 05:33:26 PM] Leah Shanker: It's just different when it's sitting on a platter in front of you...
[05/10/2009 05:33:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, even then she says no
[05/10/2009 05:34:08 PM] Leah Shanker: Ok, whatever you say.
[05/10/2009 05:34:19 PM] Leah Shanker: Good luck then

[05/16/2009 11:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got a B?
[05/16/2009 11:52:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: or an A
[05/16/2009 11:52:40 PM] Leah Shanker: which is weird because I scored so low on the test & first projects

[05/16/2009 11:53:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i thought we deserved As
[05/16/2009 11:53:22 PM] Leah Shanker: Eck only gives As to Murphys
[05/16/2009 11:53:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: especially since he is so disorganized and careless
[05/16/2009 11:53:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: our team equaled 1 murphy
[05/16/2009 11:53:52 PM] Leah Shanker: Yeah, we were badass
[05/16/2009 11:53:53 PM] Leah Shanker: in fact
[05/16/2009 11:54:10 PM] Leah Shanker: Leah, 
 
 the Cookie-Lickers CS477 final report was excellent, very impressive.  I would be grateful if you could package it up as a single big PDF document for my archive of "good examples" and send it my way.  All of the appendices can (and should, due to private tester data in some) be omitted; readers can see what they consisted of from the Table of Contents.
 
 nice work 
 Eck
 
 p.s.  It's my considered opinion that you personally have significant promise in the "human factors/UI" area of CS.  Combine that with strong technical skills and you're set.  Now if you could just tune up the time management a tad (wink)...
 
 
[05/16/2009 11:54:48 PM] Leah Shanker: we officially got a headpat from Eck
[05/16/2009 11:54:54 PM] Leah Shanker: I feel warm.
[05/16/2009 11:55:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but head pats usually come in the form of As
[05/16/2009 11:55:31 PM] Leah Shanker: meh, I'm just glad its over
[05/16/2009 11:55:39 PM] Leah Shanker: Got a C in linear!

[05/16/2009 11:55:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got an F in linear

[05/16/2009 11:56:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got a B in embedded
