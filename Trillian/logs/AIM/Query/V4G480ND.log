[08/19/2007 11:27:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: its like they don't have a loopback router
[08/19/2007 11:28:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: what crashed?
[08/19/2007 11:28:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: error?
[08/19/2007 11:28:17 PM] Brandon Collier: 209.250.30.30 type "double" invalid
[08/19/2007 11:28:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: line number?
[08/19/2007 11:28:47 PM] Brandon Collier: lemme get it again
[08/19/2007 11:28:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: forward port 62500 and i'll try to reproduce the error
[08/19/2007 11:29:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: you actually try to copy a file?
[08/19/2007 11:29:43 PM] Brandon Collier: yeah
[08/19/2007 11:29:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: crashed during copy?
[08/19/2007 11:29:57 PM] Brandon Collier: yeah
[08/19/2007 11:30:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i might know what it is
[08/19/2007 11:30:07 PM] Brandon Collier: this time it just pops up an error
[08/19/2007 11:30:12 PM] Brandon Collier: theres no line number
[08/19/2007 11:30:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[08/19/2007 11:30:28 PM] Brandon Collier: just some stupid visual basic troubleshooting tips
[08/19/2007 11:30:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/19/2007 11:30:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait got it
[08/19/2007 11:33:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: k redownload it, fixed the error
[08/19/2007 11:34:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/Debug/)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/Debug/(Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Software/Debug/)
[08/19/2007 11:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks
[08/19/2007 11:34:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: for finding that
[08/19/2007 11:35:58 PM] Brandon Collier: i think this programs would be a little hard to use...
[08/19/2007 11:37:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: how come?
[08/19/2007 11:37:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think its pretty well designed
[08/19/2007 11:38:16 PM] Brandon Collier: well, it's relying on user supplied ips
[08/19/2007 11:38:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: negative
[08/19/2007 11:38:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats an autodetect
[08/19/2007 11:38:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you first start
[08/19/2007 11:38:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh you mean when you connect
[08/19/2007 11:38:51 PM] Brandon Collier: yeah
[08/19/2007 11:38:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats true, but its recursive
[08/19/2007 11:39:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you select mine you see my remote IPs too
[08/19/2007 11:39:10 PM] Brandon Collier: it's kinda seeming like more work than just kkeping the hub up
[08/19/2007 11:39:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it will be like a chain
[08/19/2007 11:39:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not saying don't use the hub
[08/19/2007 11:39:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: this is not an alternative
[08/19/2007 11:39:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: its to help me keep my software organized
[08/19/2007 11:39:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can show people what i have without having to hash everything
[08/19/2007 11:40:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: the main feature that isn't quite finished yet is the export function
[08/19/2007 11:40:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: where i can export a list of files as like a cvs or excel document or regular txt file
[08/19/2007 11:41:11 PM] Brandon Collier: why did you keep losing your hashes last year?
[08/19/2007 11:41:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: my server crashed like a bitch because of too much hashing
[08/19/2007 11:41:50 PM] Brandon Collier: you're running linux?
[08/19/2007 11:41:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: because it hashes, it reads basically my entire system into memory
[08/19/2007 11:42:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean 2.5 tarabytes going in and out of memory is rediculous
[08/19/2007 11:42:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hashing sucks, and thats one of the worse things DC++ does
[08/19/2007 11:42:41 PM] Brandon Collier: i've never had a problem with it...
[08/19/2007 11:43:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: why hash when it adds up the files? it doesn't make any sense, you should hash after download, so while the client is hashing to check for mistakes, the server hashes and caches the code after each file
[08/19/2007 11:43:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: not all at once
[08/19/2007 11:44:32 PM] Brandon Collier: the hashing is creating a code to check the file against the origonal
[08/19/2007 11:44:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so the server should do that after someone requests the file
[08/19/2007 11:44:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean the host
[08/19/2007 11:45:17 PM] Brandon Collier: it should never load the whole file to memory tho...
[08/19/2007 11:45:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: for  example, i download a music file from you, after my download completes, i hash the file, and the server hashes the file at the same time, after download, then they compare each other
[08/19/2007 11:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wasn't loading entire files into memory, it did it stream like, but total it loads the entire file through memory just not all at once
[08/19/2007 11:46:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: which is ridiculous, 2.5 tarabytes going through 2.5 gigs of memory
[08/19/2007 11:46:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: it takes forever, and half the shit it hashed, never got downloaded
[08/19/2007 11:46:55 PM] Brandon Collier: weird, i never had problems running it through 256mb of memory
[08/19/2007 11:46:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: so why would i need to hash?
[08/19/2007 11:47:18 PM] Brandon Collier: idk really
[08/19/2007 11:47:38 PM] Brandon Collier: i'm too tired to think why
[08/19/2007 11:48:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: it doesn't
[08/19/2007 11:48:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it should only hash after the client requests it
[08/19/2007 11:49:49 PM] Brandon Collier: meh
[08/19/2007 11:53:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: well instead of hashing 3 TB this year multiple times, i am going to use my program to send people my list of files
[08/19/2007 11:53:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't feel like hashing 300 DVDs when only 10 per week will be downloaded
[08/19/2007 11:53:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i have blockbuster total access
[08/19/2007 11:53:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: skeet skeet
[08/19/2007 11:54:03 PM] Brandon Collier: nice!
[08/19/2007 11:54:14 PM] Brandon Collier: do you have into the blue?
[08/19/2007 11:54:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am getting 3.5 more TB
[08/19/2007 11:54:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i don't think so
[08/19/2007 11:54:43 PM] Brandon Collier: damn...
[08/19/2007 11:55:06 PM] Brandon Collier: well, next trip to bb can you get it, i've had to deal with the divx all summer
[08/19/2007 11:55:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[08/19/2007 11:57:15 PM] Brandon Collier: ty
[08/20/2007 12:00:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'll let you know when i have it
[08/20/2007 12:00:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: then you can copy it using my program
[08/20/2007 12:01:00 AM] Brandon Collier: ty
[08/20/2007 12:01:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: its pretty stable
[08/20/2007 12:02:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: it copies in pieces
[08/20/2007 12:02:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: and its asyncronous
[08/20/2007 12:02:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: so if there is many clients trying to connect to 1 host, it won't lose track of who its sending information to
[08/20/2007 12:03:11 AM] Brandon Collier: nice
[08/20/2007 12:03:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i need to fix the estimated time on the copy dialog
[08/20/2007 12:04:00 AM] Brandon Collier: it's ok

[09/10/2007 05:16:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should just bring it to you
[09/10/2007 05:16:30 PM] Brandon Collier: when you sent the link
[09/10/2007 05:16:46 PM] Brandon Collier: it's fine, i don't mind waiting for the image

[09/10/2007 05:19:37 PM] Brandon Collier: 1240-130
[09/10/2007 05:19:51 PM] Brandon Collier: i could pin a dvd rw to a bulletin board, lol
[09/10/2007 05:20:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could come early i don't have class before that
[09/10/2007 05:20:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have plenty of DVDr
[09/10/2007 05:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need a dual layer dvd
[09/10/2007 05:20:49 PM] Brandon Collier: that would be cool now that i have a multi format burner
[09/10/2007 05:21:04 PM] Brandon Collier: but i'm still using dvd r because of the compatability
[09/10/2007 05:21:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: dual layer dvds are expensive though
[09/10/2007 05:21:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could let you borrow a hard drive
[09/10/2007 05:21:38 PM] Brandon Collier: lol
[09/10/2007 05:21:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have a 500GB external
[09/10/2007 05:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: you could borrow it, then give it back wednesday
[09/10/2007 05:22:41 PM] Brandon Collier: or you could borrow my pod until then
[09/10/2007 05:23:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: no cuz then i need shitty apple drivers
[09/10/2007 05:23:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: and this drive has other movies if you want anything else
[09/10/2007 05:24:02 PM] Brandon Collier: mine mounts as a removable disk
[09/10/2007 05:24:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah this drive is removable too
[09/10/2007 05:24:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: or plug-and-play rather
[09/10/2007 05:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could come by now
