[09/23/2007 02:01:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was ninjas vs pirates theme
[09/23/2007 02:01:17 PM] Forest Schwyn: Ninjas are way better than pirates
[09/23/2007 02:01:34 PM] Forest Schwyn: the only thing pirates have going for them is a monopoly on the word Yar
[09/23/2007 02:01:56 PM] Forest Schwyn: 1 ninja could take out an entire ship full of pirates
[09/23/2007 02:02:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/23/2007 02:02:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: ninjas have no weakness
[09/23/2007 02:02:16 PM] Forest Schwyn: exactly
[09/23/2007 02:02:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: pirates weaknesses include money/riches and women
[09/23/2007 02:04:14 PM] Forest Schwyn: and booze
[09/23/2007 02:04:33 PM] Forest Schwyn: and hygine
[09/23/2007 02:04:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but ninjas are slaves to their cause
[09/23/2007 02:04:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats their only downfall
[09/23/2007 02:05:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the most powerful being of all would be a pirate-ninja
[09/23/2007 02:05:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: the aggression and passion of a pirate, with the skill and honor of a ninja
[09/23/2007 02:05:56 PM] Forest Schwyn: although....batman begins did resolve the issue of batman>ninjas quite nicely
[09/23/2007 02:06:04 PM] Forest Schwyn: batman is what happens when you have a billionare ninja
[09/23/2007 02:08:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: exactly
[09/23/2007 02:08:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: making batmans only weakness is his trust in people
[09/23/2007 02:10:49 PM] Forest Schwyn: yep
[09/23/2007 02:16:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: batman is a pirate too, because he steals the fear of his enemies
[09/23/2007 02:17:05 PM] Forest Schwyn: kind of
[09/23/2007 02:17:13 PM] Forest Schwyn: he is more ninja than pirate though

[08/17/2009 08:25:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually no
[08/17/2009 08:25:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the shitty thing is, i downloaded all the top 50 stuff, and it added to my ratio, so now my share ratio is fucked
[08/17/2009 08:26:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: when can i get that chip from you? what model is it again?
[08/17/2009 08:31:27 PM] Forest Schwyn: opteron 165, socket 939
[08/17/2009 08:31:56 PM] Forest Schwyn: I can either mail it to you or you can grab it from me the next time you are in phoenix, your choice
[08/17/2009 08:33:18 PM] Forest Schwyn: although I will need your mailing address if you want it mailed
[08/17/2009 09:01:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok i can invite, what e-mail address do you want to use?
[08/17/2009 09:02:09 PM] Forest Schwyn: spectre@masterwoot.com

[08/17/2009 09:03:08 PM] Forest Schwyn: how do you want me to get that processor to you?
[08/17/2009 09:04:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess mail it, put it in a chip case and a padded envelope, put your return address on it and if everything works out i will send you 40 bucks if that price works for you?
[08/17/2009 09:04:35 PM] Forest Schwyn: sure
[08/17/2009 09:04:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's only 1.8 MHz though...
[08/17/2009 09:04:43 PM] Forest Schwyn: yeah
[08/17/2009 09:05:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i have another friend that has a 3500+ that he wants to get rid of for about the same price, but the opteron is a pretty solid chip
[08/17/2009 09:05:15 PM] Forest Schwyn: you want a heatsink to go with it? I have two Thermalright XP120s laying around
[08/17/2009 09:05:43 PM] Forest Schwyn: I forgot it was that slow by default. I kept it overclocked at 2.8 Ghz most of the time
[08/17/2009 09:05:58 PM] Forest Schwyn: and whats your mailing address?
[08/17/2009 09:08:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: uhh yeah a heatsink would be good, the only spare i have really sucks, i trashed it

[08/17/2009 09:10:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok sounds good
[08/17/2009 09:10:29 PM] Forest Schwyn: do you have a 120mm fan laying around or do you need me to send one?
[08/17/2009 09:10:53 PM] Forest Schwyn: I have a spare...but its a beast.
[08/17/2009 09:11:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just got some new fans, so i am good, thanks though
[08/17/2009 09:11:33 PM] Forest Schwyn: ok sweet
[08/17/2009 09:11:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate when fans get dusty and loud
[08/17/2009 09:11:55 PM] Forest Schwyn: I'll try to get it all out after work tomarrow then
[08/17/2009 09:12:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: they need to find a way to seal the rotating mechanism
[08/17/2009 09:12:26 PM] Forest Schwyn: seal the rotating mechanism?
[08/17/2009 09:12:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesome, thanks a ton, i guess i'll pay for shipping to, just let me know
[08/17/2009 09:13:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah like put the motor inside a container with just a rod sticking out holding the fan, and seal it with some type of grease
[08/17/2009 09:13:22 PM] Forest Schwyn: ahh
[08/17/2009 09:13:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: so dust can never get under the crappy piece of plastic and make them loud
[08/17/2009 09:13:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: my chip fan is really loud
[08/17/2009 09:14:39 PM] Forest Schwyn: the northbridge fans can get loud because since most of the time they are just 60mm fans they have to spin at like 10k rpm to actually push any air
[08/17/2009 09:15:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there is this app to change it on the fly, it is pretty cool i can make it slow down and save power or make it speed up and be loud
[08/17/2009 09:15:07 PM] Forest Schwyn: thats one of the things I like about 120mm fans, you can get almost silent ones and they still push plenty of air
[08/17/2009 09:15:26 PM] Forest Schwyn: ...or you can be me and still put fans that are loud and push shitons of air
[08/17/2009 09:15:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, northbridge is a heatsink
[08/17/2009 09:15:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/17/2009 09:16:21 PM] Forest Schwyn: the last fan I had on my heatsink blew 150cfm of air, it was awesome
[08/17/2009 09:16:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow
[08/17/2009 09:17:27 PM] Forest Schwyn: (Link: http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/deaf12suhisp.html)http://www.sidewindercomputers.com/deaf12suhisp.html
[08/17/2009 09:17:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i bought a bunch of fluid dynamic fans that move like 60 cfm and have a dbm of only 29 for the 90s and 39 for the 120s
[08/17/2009 09:17:58 PM] Forest Schwyn: I always bought the fans that pushed the most air since overlocking was a hobby of mine
[08/17/2009 09:18:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: makes sense
[08/17/2009 09:19:17 PM] Forest Schwyn: althogth I never did get the best 120mm... they have one out that pushes 220 cfm
[08/17/2009 09:19:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, i wonder how loud it is
[08/17/2009 09:20:56 PM] Forest Schwyn: really loud, 65db
[08/17/2009 09:21:09 PM] Forest Schwyn: not really meant for desktop use
[08/17/2009 09:21:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, my computers are in my room so that is not an option
[08/17/2009 09:21:27 PM] Forest Schwyn: not really needed though
[08/17/2009 09:21:52 PM] Forest Schwyn: I computer running at stock settings with a really nice settings can run almost silent with a 120mm fan
[08/17/2009 09:22:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
