[04/21/2009 01:31:15 AM] Meaghan Winfield: yeah, other teams

[04/21/2009 01:31:22 AM] Meaghan Winfield: they've all been different so far
[04/21/2009 01:31:23 AM] Brian Cullinan: don't do that!
[04/21/2009 01:31:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: the worse they look, the better we look, do you really care about anyone on those other teams?

[04/21/2009 01:32:32 AM] Meaghan Winfield: but I promise not to fill out any other surveys, just for you
[04/21/2009 01:32:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: they're ok, but don't do anything for those stupid guys that annoy me
[04/21/2009 01:32:53 AM] Meaghan Winfield: those stupid guys that annoy you annoy me as well
[04/21/2009 01:34:08 AM] Meaghan Winfield: have you talked to Mike at all this past weekend?
[04/21/2009 01:34:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: nope, not since the party
[04/21/2009 01:34:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: and that chick totally wasn't as attractive as i wished she was
[04/21/2009 01:34:52 AM] Meaghan Winfield: that chick didn't show up
[04/21/2009 01:35:06 AM] Meaghan Winfield: the random chick that showed up was the wife of his neighbor or something
[04/21/2009 01:35:14 AM] Meaghan Winfield: Mike's drug den buddies
[04/21/2009 01:36:18 AM] Meaghan Winfield: yay drug den buddies....
[04/21/2009 01:36:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/21/2009 01:37:13 AM] Meaghan Winfield: he'll hopefully be leaving them behind after he moves in with you, at least for a few months
[04/21/2009 01:37:17 AM] Meaghan Winfield: so....thanks
[04/21/2009 01:38:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm, not a big advocate of the whacky?
[04/21/2009 01:39:02 AM] Meaghan Winfield: I doubt I'll be hearing from mike for a few days, he's currently too stoned to function
[04/21/2009 01:39:23 AM] Meaghan Winfield: he almost didn't come on friday because he was too stoned
[04/21/2009 01:39:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i honestly don't see the draw
[04/21/2009 01:40:19 AM] Meaghan Winfield: Mike is usually very good with getting stoned, it doesn't negatively affect him
[04/21/2009 01:40:36 AM] Meaghan Winfield: except for lately, when he's standing me up and disappearing for days
[04/21/2009 01:41:08 AM] Meaghan Winfield: so...yeah, currently not a fan
