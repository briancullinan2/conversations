[09/01/2008 06:24:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: too cold for blended drinks
[09/01/2008 06:24:57 PM] Meaghan Winfield: it was gilmore girls though, so I don't know if thats a deterent
[09/01/2008 06:25:14 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I think it would be fine, the alcohol will keep people warm
[09/01/2008 06:25:28 PM] Meaghan Winfield: Google has provided the idea of a white trash trailer bash

[09/01/2008 06:27:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i should get an ice sculpture
[09/01/2008 06:27:36 PM] Meaghan Winfield: those are expensive
[09/01/2008 06:27:47 PM] Meaghan Winfield: although, I'd be into helping make one
[09/01/2008 06:28:16 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I've joined your event
[09/01/2008 06:28:33 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I'm excited, it sounds like a pretty sweet party

[09/09/2008 02:04:47 PM] Meaghan Winfield: recent development, I'm thrilled, he's awesome
[09/09/2008 02:04:58 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I'm concerned about coming out in the open with this
[09/09/2008 02:05:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyone i know?
[09/09/2008 02:05:06 PM] Meaghan Winfield: certian people might not be too thrilled.....
[09/09/2008 02:05:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: who is it?
[09/09/2008 02:05:24 PM] Meaghan Winfield: oh, you might actually know him 
[09/09/2008 02:05:27 PM] Meaghan Winfield: Brian Davis
[09/09/2008 02:05:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope
[09/09/2008 02:05:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't ring any bells
[09/09/2008 02:05:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: why would people not be thrilled?
[09/09/2008 02:05:54 PM] Meaghan Winfield: he used to work at the help desk
[09/09/2008 02:06:32 PM] Meaghan Winfield: Okay, I guess I should narrow this down....
[09/09/2008 02:06:38 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I'm concerned about Travis
[09/09/2008 02:06:44 PM] Meaghan Winfield: Should I even be?
[09/09/2008 02:06:56 PM] Meaghan Winfield: Or am I being conceited for even thinking he'd care
[09/09/2008 02:07:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: you shouldn't care
[09/09/2008 02:07:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you are not being concieted
[09/09/2008 02:07:48 PM] Meaghan Winfield: okay
[09/09/2008 02:07:50 PM] Meaghan Winfield: how's crystal?
[09/09/2008 02:08:07 PM] Meaghan Winfield: oh! 
[09/09/2008 02:08:12 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I may have girls to bring to your parties
[09/09/2008 02:08:17 PM] Meaghan Winfield: like....a lot of them!
[09/09/2008 02:08:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesome!
[09/09/2008 02:08:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so travis is kind of a douche bag
[09/09/2008 02:09:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: he was crying over andrea not wanting to be friends with him
[09/09/2008 02:09:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then he always has something negative to say about you, like "who cares about meagan", and then infront of other people he is all like "w/e"
[09/09/2008 02:10:06 PM] Meaghan Winfield: did she actually not want to be friends with him, or was he assuming she didn't
[09/09/2008 02:10:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: and pretends to be all friendly with you
[09/09/2008 02:10:13 PM] Meaghan Winfield: wow, what a douchebag
[09/09/2008 02:10:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he wants to have these "heart to hearts"
[09/09/2008 02:10:21 PM] Meaghan Winfield: yeah
[09/09/2008 02:10:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is right for him to assume she doesn't
[09/09/2008 02:10:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: some other people had to tell him that she doesn't
[09/09/2008 02:11:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i think you parading around your boyfriend would serve him right
[09/09/2008 02:11:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: tough love you know
[09/09/2008 02:11:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: he needs to get over it
[09/09/2008 02:11:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: and he will when he sees your happy
[09/09/2008 02:13:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so talk about these girls?
[09/09/2008 02:14:04 PM] Meaghan Winfield: thanks brian
[09/09/2008 02:14:08 PM] Meaghan Winfield: that makes me feel less nervoud
[09/09/2008 02:14:11 PM] Meaghan Winfield: nervous*
[09/09/2008 02:14:14 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I just hate it when he freaks out
[09/09/2008 02:14:26 PM] Meaghan Winfield: so, these girls are pretty much the equivalent to scene whores
[09/09/2008 02:14:34 PM] Meaghan Winfield: they will pretty much be coming over for the alcohol
[09/09/2008 02:14:42 PM] Meaghan Winfield: but they are....very freindly
[09/09/2008 02:14:55 PM] Meaghan Winfield: friendly*
[09/09/2008 02:14:55 PM] Meaghan Winfield: and cute
[09/09/2008 02:15:13 PM] Meaghan Winfield: they like their drinking games
[09/09/2008 02:15:25 PM] Meaghan Winfield: and hookah
[09/09/2008 02:15:43 PM] Meaghan Winfield: surprisingly, they're all the christian girls I bashed last week
[09/09/2008 02:16:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds perfect
[09/09/2008 02:16:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would love for them to come
[09/09/2008 02:16:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you tell them the theme?
[09/09/2008 02:17:05 PM] Meaghan Winfield: for the ice party?
[09/09/2008 02:17:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[09/09/2008 02:17:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: or before also
[09/09/2008 02:17:17 PM] Meaghan Winfield: no, I just said parties in general
[09/09/2008 02:17:27 PM] Meaghan Winfield: but they'll probably all come to the ice party
[09/09/2008 02:17:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if tavis starts to get all weird and emotional with you, just ignore him, if he expresses anger try not to react, if you remain indifferent about him, then everything will work out
[09/09/2008 02:18:13 PM] Meaghan Winfield: sounds like a plan
[09/09/2008 02:18:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe invite them over this weekend?
[09/09/2008 02:18:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think we might do something saturday
[09/09/2008 02:18:50 PM] Meaghan Winfield: the thing is is that they're concerned about not fitting in or knowing what you're all talking about
[09/09/2008 02:19:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, well maybe I should meet them
[09/09/2008 02:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: we don't always talk about nerdy stuff
[09/09/2008 02:19:24 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I know
[09/09/2008 02:19:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i try not to when other people are around
[09/09/2008 02:19:30 PM] Meaghan Winfield: they're concerned you will
[09/09/2008 02:19:47 PM] Meaghan Winfield: but they also have the option of hanging out with eachother
[09/09/2008 02:19:59 PM] Meaghan Winfield: they're all underage people who are pretty desperate for parties/alcohol
[09/09/2008 02:20:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: names?
[09/09/2008 02:20:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: facebook?
[09/09/2008 02:20:15 PM] Meaghan Winfield: just a sec

[09/09/2008 02:25:17 PM] Meaghan Winfield: and then they have a few friends that usually all follow them around
[09/09/2008 02:26:34 PM] Meaghan Winfield: what do you think?
[09/09/2008 02:26:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[09/09/2008 02:27:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: they aren't really hot
[09/09/2008 02:27:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have high standards
[09/09/2008 02:27:47 PM] Meaghan Winfield: and a hot girlfriend already
[09/09/2008 02:28:01 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I figured that if the male to female ratio was being changed, that would help
[09/09/2008 02:28:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/09/2008 02:28:43 PM] Meaghan Winfield: they're at least kind of cute
[09/09/2008 02:29:04 PM] Meaghan Winfield: right?
[09/09/2008 02:29:15 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I mean, crystal and andrea are much hotter
[09/09/2008 02:29:21 PM] Meaghan Winfield: but you know, there are only two of them
[09/09/2008 02:30:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/09/2008 02:39:44 PM] Meaghan Winfield: I bet Dave Smith could end up getting them all in an orgy
[09/09/2008 02:39:48 PM] Meaghan Winfield: :-P
[09/09/2008 02:55:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha probably
