[08/03/2008 11:37:10 PM] Matt Shanker: what up?
[08/03/2008 11:37:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i keep getting tv error: failed to get recording show list
[08/03/2008 11:38:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: my tuner even works in vlc without a channel change, and whenever i run mythtv from the command line it opens up like it is going to start and then immediately exits and that is the error i get
[08/03/2008 11:38:23 PM] Matt Shanker: did you run mythfilldatabase and make sure the backend is running after that?
[08/03/2008 11:38:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: ye
[08/03/2008 11:38:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: s
[08/03/2008 11:38:40 PM] Matt Shanker: dunno, never seen that error before
[08/03/2008 11:39:50 PM] Matt Shanker: did you set up your tuner correctly in the setup program?
[08/03/2008 11:40:00 PM] Matt Shanker: that error will appear if there is no available tuner I think
[08/03/2008 11:40:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: do i have to add all the channels too?
[08/03/2008 11:40:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: or does it do it automatically?
[08/03/2008 11:40:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: because when i run mythfilldatabase it says no channel sources defined or something
[08/03/2008 11:41:00 PM] Matt Shanker: You need to set up a video source and you can scan for channels there
[08/03/2008 11:41:08 PM] Matt Shanker: and then assign the video source to a tuner
[08/03/2008 11:41:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[08/03/2008 11:41:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: on the backend setup correct?
[08/03/2008 11:41:35 PM] Matt Shanker: I'm pretty sure

[08/04/2008 12:23:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: that was ridiculous
[08/04/2008 12:23:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: definitely a bad ui design
[08/04/2008 12:23:48 AM] Matt Shanker: the awkwardness of it is partially due to the front-end/backend design
[08/04/2008 12:24:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: i can't say i disagree with that paradigm because i have tried to write my own media server
[08/04/2008 12:25:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the input devices we automatically inserted when i added the capture card, and then the inputs weren't assigned to any hardware device, for a noobie like me this can be very confusing
[08/04/2008 12:27:11 AM] Matt Shanker: Yeah, the design is really made to be scalable. For example, you can have one beefy backend server with like 4 TV cards in it in a server closet. then you can put tiny little low-profile clients connected to each TV in your house and it would be a pretty sweet setup
[08/04/2008 12:31:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be sweet
[08/04/2008 12:31:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: now that i know it works i can imagine myself expanding on it

[04/10/2009 03:01:33 PM] Matt Shanker: shoot
[04/10/2009 03:02:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: So, i have a pop3 and pop3s port open on my server, but my router only forwards the pop3 port currently, if i open the pop3s port will all mail message come in over an encrypted pipe?  do other servers doing the sending check for the secure port first?
[04/10/2009 03:03:36 PM] Matt Shanker: pop is for the mail client only, other servers doing the sending will be sending to your SMTP server
[04/10/2009 03:05:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, so i would have to option to receive my mail over encryption.  Is there a way of encrypting my smtp port that other servers send to?  How do i avoid someone intercepting it on it's way inbound?
[04/10/2009 03:06:57 PM] Matt Shanker: Yes, you can encrypt SMTP, however it has to be agreed upon by both sender and receiver. As far as I know it's only realistic if you are controlling both the sending and receiving servers.
[04/10/2009 03:07:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: which i am usually not
[04/10/2009 03:08:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so do people just not exploit incoming mail?
[04/10/2009 03:08:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: people only attack checking your mail?
[04/10/2009 03:09:35 PM] Matt Shanker: Depends on what you mean by exploiting incoming mail. If they can sniff SMTP communication then yes they can read all the mail. That's why for secure email people do client-side encryption (PGP encrypt the message itself)
[04/10/2009 03:10:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: that makes sense
[04/10/2009 03:20:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: Weird, i have been receiving and sending emails but i can't get my outgoing server to work in my mail client.
