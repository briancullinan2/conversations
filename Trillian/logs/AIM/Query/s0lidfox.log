[04/19/2008 11:12:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been meaning to ask you for your screen name in the ACM room but i kept forgetting
[04/19/2008 11:13:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i stole it off face book
[04/19/2008 11:13:37 PM] Ryan Raub: thats why i put it up on the facebook
[04/19/2008 11:15:20 PM] Ryan Raub: hows the pine smell in the kitchen?
[04/19/2008 11:15:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: it has served me well
[04/19/2008 11:15:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was able to put off mopping until not today
[04/19/2008 11:15:57 PM] Ryan Raub: nice
[04/19/2008 11:16:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks for picking up the sky, we will save it for next week unless you want it back sooner?
[04/19/2008 11:17:19 PM] Ryan Raub: keep it, 
[04/19/2008 11:17:46 PM] Ryan Raub: figured i drink enough of ur stuff
[04/19/2008 11:17:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am buying cheep whiskey from now on, i am tired of my kettle one and grey goose disappearing on me
[04/19/2008 11:18:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: not just you, optimally everyone would pitch in, but seems we always get those few who donate and those few who leech
[04/19/2008 11:19:40 PM] Ryan Raub: yeah, i always try to bring something, to a party like that, and i didn't last week, so i figured i'd make up for it
[04/19/2008 11:20:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks, it is greatly appreciated
[04/19/2008 11:20:43 PM] Ryan Raub: np
[04/19/2008 11:20:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i might just put out a donation bucket to buy drinks
[04/19/2008 11:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: now that they are getting bigger at least
[04/19/2008 11:21:37 PM] Ryan Raub: that might work, or just go around and collect $ for a bashas run
[04/19/2008 11:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: is everyone else able to enjoy BSG as much as i am, i feel everyone quiets down when it on, it is kind of impressive
[04/19/2008 11:23:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/19/2008 11:25:20 PM] Ryan Raub: yeah, it is nice that the party kinda "stops" for it
[04/19/2008 11:26:09 PM] Ryan Raub: and some people (like steve) who arn't that interested in  BSG just show up after
[04/19/2008 11:26:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, there are a few people that aren't that interested, but they deal with it just to get to the after party
[04/19/2008 11:27:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, i also forgot to mention, my dad responded about the sign, he said it would be pretty easy, and he would send us a lighting solution too, i told him we had about six inches of space behind it and he said that would be perfect
[04/19/2008 11:28:08 PM] Ryan Raub: awesome, did he say how long it would take?
[04/19/2008 11:29:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to give him a call, but when i ordered printed posters it only took a few weeks including shipping, so assuming he already sent the files off to his graphics artist, should only be another 2 weeks or two before we receive it.
[04/19/2008 11:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: so probably a little before the end of school like i predicted
[04/19/2008 11:29:58 PM] Ryan Raub: ok cool, as long as it is before the end of the semester
[04/19/2008 11:30:10 PM] Ryan Raub: thanks again for coordinating this 
[04/19/2008 11:30:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey no problem, my pleasure, it was the one thing i could contribute
[04/19/2008 11:30:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: we might even be able to get printed logos for the side of it, it this turns out well
[04/19/2008 11:31:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: he has the ability to print on a glossy adhesive paper
[04/19/2008 11:31:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is pretty cool
[04/19/2008 11:31:37 PM] Ryan Raub: nice, yeah that would be a nice touch
[04/19/2008 11:31:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could just stick it on the side, it might even be removable (like a decal) it we ever wanted to change advertisements

[04/20/2008 10:53:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like physics but science teachers can either be good, or really suck
[04/20/2008 10:54:16 PM] Ryan Raub: true, like most classes
[04/20/2008 10:54:28 PM] Ryan Raub: but i would say if u can get any teacher besides cole u should be fine
[04/20/2008 10:54:39 PM] Ryan Raub: but unfortunatly he teaches allot of the intro classes
[04/20/2008 10:56:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am thinking phy 161 but i don't want a 3 hour lab

[04/23/2008 07:01:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: wait, how does an annotation work?
[04/23/2008 07:01:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: is it like auto inserting code?
[04/23/2008 07:02:16 PM] Ryan Raub: its kinda like setting a "trigger" or an action for a method

[04/23/2008 07:02:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: like a button click? potentially?
[04/23/2008 07:02:57 PM] Ryan Raub: not really
[04/23/2008 07:03:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: so a trigger at compile time, not runtime?
[04/23/2008 07:03:30 PM] Ryan Raub: I haven't used them that much so im not 100% savvy on annotations
[04/23/2008 07:03:35 PM] Ryan Raub: compile time i believe
[04/23/2008 07:04:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: interesting
[04/23/2008 07:05:03 PM] Ryan Raub: im sure Mc dave will have more insight into their uses

[05/30/2008 02:52:35 PM] Ryan Raub: but a freaking pain to get right IMO
[05/30/2008 02:54:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah sometimes i get stuck on something and when i figure it out i am just like "wtf does it do that?"
[05/30/2008 02:54:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i learned to use {assign} a lot
[05/30/2008 02:54:47 PM] Ryan Raub: setting smarty variables, yeah that took me awhile
[05/30/2008 02:55:53 PM] Ryan Raub: murphy had our survey thing for 386 doing a ton of the assignment stuff for you
[05/30/2008 02:56:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/30/2008 02:57:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example why the hell does it always give me $smarty. is an unknown reference
[05/30/2008 02:57:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if i assign it to something else first, it works just fine
[05/30/2008 03:00:03 PM] Ryan Raub: dose an isset() fail ?

[08/26/2008 04:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah aluminum isn't going to work
[08/26/2008 04:57:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll try vaccuforming 
[08/26/2008 04:57:15 PM] Ryan Raub: do it urself? or have someone do it for u
[08/26/2008 04:57:22 PM] Ryan Raub: cause the molds are the hard thing to make
[08/26/2008 04:57:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: who would do it for me?
[08/26/2008 04:58:17 PM] Ryan Raub: theres a number of places that would, 
[08/26/2008 04:58:26 PM] Ryan Raub: just google vacuum forming 
[08/26/2008 04:58:46 PM] Ryan Raub: and are u looking for a batman costume?
[08/26/2008 04:58:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[08/26/2008 04:59:39 PM] Ryan Raub: id recommend checking out fan sites, for prop replica's etc
[08/26/2008 04:59:44 PM] Ryan Raub: thats usually where u'll find the best info
[08/26/2008 04:59:56 PM] Ryan Raub: but be prepared to drop ~400+

[08/26/2008 05:06:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck
[08/26/2008 05:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: his costume looks like shit though
[08/26/2008 05:11:20 PM] Ryan Raub: but the tumbler looks bad ass
[08/26/2008 05:11:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not having any luck
[08/26/2008 05:22:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could form it out of fiberglass
[08/26/2008 05:22:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5860)http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=5860
[08/26/2008 05:23:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what the last query on the cover of the magazine says
[08/26/2008 05:27:51 PM] Ryan Raub: much better looking, but i bet even more expensive
[08/26/2008 05:27:55 PM] Ryan Raub: and heavy
[08/26/2008 05:28:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: fiberglass is heavy?
[08/26/2008 05:28:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: it would be easier to form the large parts
[08/26/2008 05:28:24 PM] Ryan Raub: heavier than the plastic molding 
[08/26/2008 05:28:32 PM] Ryan Raub: possibly.. 
[08/26/2008 05:28:45 PM] Ryan Raub: haven't worked with fiberglass before i take it..
[08/26/2008 05:29:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i could just load certain parts up with extra rosin and fiberglass sheets, then use a handheld shaver to carve out a little more detail
[08/26/2008 05:30:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am thinking the shoulders and chest plates, and knee caps mainly
[08/26/2008 05:30:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: what i really need is like a thick rubber that i can just cut shapes out of
[08/26/2008 05:30:46 PM] Ryan Raub: well that sounds like a more do-able idea
[08/26/2008 05:31:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: the aluminum didn't work
[08/26/2008 05:31:13 PM] Ryan Raub: working with fiberglass is messy and difficult.. 
[08/26/2008 05:31:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got some from home depot today, and it isn't malliable enough
[08/26/2008 05:31:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know that about fiberglass, but i think it would be the best solution for the shoulders and stuff, much easier then vacuuforming still
[08/26/2008 05:31:53 PM] Ryan Raub: (Link: http://www.generalplastics.com/products/product_detail.php?pid=19)http://www.generalplastics.com/products/product_detail.php?pid=19
[08/26/2008 05:31:58 PM] Ryan Raub: modeling foam
[08/26/2008 05:32:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm not a bad idea
[08/26/2008 05:32:16 PM] Ryan Raub: kinda pricy but u can seal it nicely
[08/26/2008 05:32:29 PM] Ryan Raub: just dont plan on it actually taking abuse too well
[08/26/2008 05:33:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/26/2008 05:33:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have to find a metal mesh
[08/26/2008 05:33:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and a wet suit
[08/26/2008 05:34:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd rather had rubber then foam

[09/09/2008 10:37:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: question
[09/09/2008 10:37:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: prompt: i am looking to build a coffee table with glass on top and a platform underneath so that stuff can be displayed in between
[09/09/2008 10:39:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want it to be deconstructable, so i want thinking of connecting all the corners and joints with those screws where half of them screw into the wood and the other half has like a hole in it and just sticks into a hold in the wood, and another screw meets it from a different side
[09/09/2008 10:39:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: any idea what those are called? a type of finishing screw? i see them a lot when i build stuff from IKEA
[09/09/2008 10:49:52 AM] Ryan Raub: like a flat ended screw without threads on one end?
[09/09/2008 10:50:11 AM] Ryan Raub: picture? 
[09/09/2008 10:51:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: it's like a finish screw, but it has a hole in it to put another screw through
[09/09/2008 10:51:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: can't find a picture
[09/09/2008 10:51:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: to lock it in
[09/09/2008 10:51:58 AM] Ryan Raub: (Link: http://www.anchorco.com/images/snapSkruLrg.jpg)http://www.anchorco.com/images/snapSkruLrg.jpg
[09/09/2008 10:52:07 AM] Ryan Raub: thats a drywall anchor 
[09/09/2008 10:52:18 AM] Ryan Raub: but u run a screw down the center of it... 
[09/09/2008 10:52:50 AM] Ryan Raub: (Link: http://brass-anchors.electrical-brass-components.com/brass-anchor.jpg)http://brass-anchors.electrical-brass-components.com/brass-anchor.jpg
[09/09/2008 10:52:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah kind of, but metal, used to building cabinets
[09/09/2008 10:52:58 AM] Ryan Raub: and thouse are for wood
[09/09/2008 10:53:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: no
[09/09/2008 10:53:11 AM] Brian Cullinan: i see what you mean
[09/09/2008 10:53:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: the hole is the other way
[09/09/2008 10:53:47 AM] Brian Cullinan: so it screws in vertically, then it has a hole through it horizontally
[09/09/2008 10:53:53 AM] Ryan Raub: ah
[09/09/2008 10:54:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: so the end with a hole it in horizontally sticks into a hole in the wood and meets with another screw
[09/09/2008 10:54:38 AM] Ryan Raub: a Female Wedge Anchor

[09/09/2008 10:55:08 AM] Ryan Raub: thats the worst picture ever
[09/09/2008 10:55:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/09/2008 10:56:14 AM] Ryan Raub: homedopot might have something that would work
[09/09/2008 10:56:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: ohhhh see those turn to lock on to the screw
[09/09/2008 10:56:27 AM] Ryan Raub: but "in real life" people who build cabinets dont use that kinda hardware
[09/09/2008 10:56:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: but essentially that is what it is doing
[09/09/2008 10:56:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i just want something that can be descructed
[09/09/2008 10:56:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: taken apart
[09/09/2008 10:56:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: moved
[09/09/2008 10:56:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: re finished
[09/09/2008 10:57:38 AM] Ryan Raub: would this hardware hold the glass in place?
[09/09/2008 10:58:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: no, the glass i was just going to seal with caulking
[09/09/2008 10:59:56 AM] Ryan Raub: so if its coffee table sized i dont see the point of disassymbly 
[09/09/2008 11:01:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: actually i was hoping i could find wood that has has a shape like :
 ___
 |   _|
 |   |_
 |      |
 |___|
[09/09/2008 11:01:44 AM] Ryan Raub: um, possibly.. it would be easier to just cut that out with a router
[09/09/2008 11:03:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/09/2008 11:03:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: that would be the edge of the wood
[09/09/2008 11:03:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: so the glass would fit into that slot
[09/09/2008 11:03:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: with caulking to seal it
[09/09/2008 11:05:00 AM] Ryan Raub: ok, well the top edge wouldn't be nessiary. cause the caulking would hold it down 
[09/09/2008 11:05:15 AM] Ryan Raub: that would allow you to replace the glass without taking the wood frame apart
[09/09/2008 11:05:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that was more for style because i don't want to use caulting on the top and have the glass and caulting showing
[09/09/2008 11:05:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: *caulking
[09/09/2008 11:06:09 AM] Ryan Raub: dude... what color wood stain are u thinking? dark oak or like a white wallnut?
[09/09/2008 11:06:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: lighter color to match my table
[09/09/2008 11:06:46 AM] Ryan Raub: actually that dosn't matter, clear caulking (if done right) wouldn't really even be that visable
[09/09/2008 11:07:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i was also thinking an edge would be nice to have with all the spills that happen at my place
[09/09/2008 11:08:34 AM] Ryan Raub: u'll have to draw me what ur invisioning, and i'm sure i can come up with something that will work
[09/09/2008 11:08:47 AM] Ryan Raub: and not in ascii =p
[09/09/2008 11:08:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: ok sounds good
[09/09/2008 11:09:14 AM] Brian Cullinan: i g2g clean desks

[09/15/2008 04:20:59 PM] Ryan Raub: did u have to change the design much from what we had talked about?
[09/15/2008 04:21:08 PM] Ryan Raub: and what was the total at home depot? over 100?
[09/15/2008 04:21:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope
[09/15/2008 04:21:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: total was over 100
[09/15/2008 04:21:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: with glass it will probably be 170
[09/15/2008 04:21:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: i added some wood filler to make the edges come together better
[09/15/2008 04:21:47 PM] Ryan Raub: still not too bad for a custom coffee table
[09/15/2008 04:21:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: screws didn't sink into the aluminum, that added an interesting aspect
[09/15/2008 04:22:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some of them snapped because the hardwood was too hard
[09/15/2008 04:22:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that sucked
[09/15/2008 04:22:46 PM] Ryan Raub: didn't u drill piolit holes
[09/15/2008 04:22:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/15/2008 04:23:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: even with the pilot holes
[09/15/2008 04:23:25 PM] Ryan Raub: bigger pilot holes then =]
[09/15/2008 04:23:29 PM] Ryan Raub: that shouldn't happen
[09/15/2008 04:23:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and some of the holes were shredded but i think that is because i drilled them too deep and they didn't catch at the end, but they still held
[09/15/2008 04:23:47 PM] Ryan Raub: did u use wood glue?
[09/15/2008 04:23:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: not much
[09/15/2008 04:24:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't really have the clamp that would be usefull for it
[09/15/2008 04:25:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it turned out pretty well, it is pretty sturdy, everything lines up pretty good, i am ready to sand it with the 250 and stain it
[09/15/2008 04:25:25 PM] Ryan Raub: nice, glad to hear it
[09/15/2008 04:25:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i left a rim on it too that will sit up above the glass
[09/15/2008 04:25:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i am going to go with the half inch glass
[09/15/2008 04:25:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: just for kicks
[09/15/2008 04:25:56 PM] Ryan Raub: keep spills off the ground
[09/15/2008 04:26:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/15/2008 04:27:34 PM] Ryan Raub: nice, just dont screwup the caulking
[09/15/2008 04:27:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: at least it is clear
[09/15/2008 04:46:37 PM] Ryan Raub: did u find out what kinda glass ur gonna get and from where?
[09/15/2008 04:51:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope
[09/15/2008 04:51:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: but there is a Glass and Mirror place in town i am going to visit tomorrow
[09/15/2008 04:51:59 PM] Ryan Raub: ok, just be sure to tell them what ur building it for. so they have an idea of the strength that ur gonna need
[09/15/2008 04:52:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yup
[09/15/2008 04:52:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude, you should see my calendar scripts
[09/15/2008 04:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i pick a web page and parse it into a calendar
[09/15/2008 04:53:01 PM] Ryan Raub: example?
[09/15/2008 04:53:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: like my IMDb shows script you can specify a list of shows and it will download all the showtimes and make a calendar out of them
[09/15/2008 04:53:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i add a calendar by Url in outlook or google cal or ical in your case
[09/15/2008 04:53:44 PM] Ryan Raub: nice, greasemonkey? or php?
[09/15/2008 04:53:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: php
[09/15/2008 04:54:06 PM] Ryan Raub: k, so its running on ur box and hitting imdb
[09/15/2008 04:54:09 PM] Ryan Raub: nice
[09/15/2008 04:54:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to improve the efficiency and robustness one of these days
[09/15/2008 04:54:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i also have one for coming soon .net
[09/15/2008 04:54:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and even peoplesoft
[09/15/2008 04:55:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it tells me whenever we have a day off
[09/15/2008 04:55:47 PM] Ryan Raub: nice
[09/15/2008 04:56:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to write a builder for it where you can specify the xpath logic for parsing any site, and caching features to make it faster and download the dates at night
[09/15/2008 04:56:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: or periodically
[09/15/2008 04:57:54 PM] Ryan Raub: nice, sounds fairly useful 
[09/15/2008 04:57:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: eventually i will make it as powerfull as like those paid tv schedule sites that myth uses
[09/15/2008 04:58:21 PM] Ryan Raub: are u using any third party libraries to parse dates for you?
[09/15/2008 04:58:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: not currently, it is all pretty site specific right now
[09/15/2008 04:59:20 PM] Ryan Raub: ah, cause im using one in ruby.  and it picks up human readable date strings 
[09/15/2008 04:59:25 PM] Ryan Raub: like "next wednesday"
[09/15/2008 04:59:38 PM] Ryan Raub: kinda amazing really. 
[09/15/2008 04:59:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: nice
[09/15/2008 04:59:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will have to look for one
[09/15/2008 05:00:31 PM] Ryan Raub: might be cool to parse blog posts for stuff like that, so if the author says something mid post about something that is going on "next week" you can pull that out
[09/15/2008 05:00:43 PM] Ryan Raub: mail does that in email messages.. freaking super useful
[09/15/2008 05:01:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, even better i should just write a system for downloading related content to user created calendar scripts
[09/15/2008 05:02:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe searching google for key words, looking for patterns and bringing up movie traliers and e-mailing the users updates.  even putting it all together in a nice RSS feed would be awesome
[09/15/2008 05:02:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: reviews would be really usefull too
[09/15/2008 05:02:56 PM] Ryan Raub: yeah, im all about the "push" mentality for web events
[09/15/2008 05:04:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: like if i create a calendar to show me movies that are coming out soon, i want my script to send me the descriptions and trailer links and roten tomatoes reviews from the previewing
[09/15/2008 05:04:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but everything other then extracting the titles, i want it to do automatically
[09/15/2008 05:04:47 PM] Ryan Raub: fyi: theres a freaking sweet mac dashboard app that does that kinda thing ardy
[09/15/2008 05:05:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: not to mention wikipedia would be one of the most reliable sources, and one of the top hits for any topic searched for
[09/15/2008 05:05:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, you think it is pretty robust?
[09/15/2008 05:05:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is it called, i could use it as a starting point
[09/15/2008 05:06:01 PM] Ryan Raub: the only thing it dosnt have is reviews
[09/15/2008 05:06:39 PM] Ryan Raub: (Link: http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2007/06/11241/)http://uneasysilence.com/archive/2007/06/11241/
[09/15/2008 05:07:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is for movies specifically, i am talking about semi intelligent stuff
[09/15/2008 05:07:28 PM] Ryan Raub: yeah
[09/15/2008 05:15:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i will make it so that it loads the page in a frame, and as you click on things it builds a regexp to match it

[09/17/2008 05:28:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to try to get the stuff cut tonight
[09/17/2008 05:28:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: everything is sanded
[09/17/2008 05:28:14 PM] Ryan Raub: nice
[09/17/2008 05:28:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i will go over the middle piece again after it is cut, then everything will be ready to be stained
[09/17/2008 05:28:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do you remove stain?
[09/17/2008 05:29:28 PM] Ryan Raub: like if u messed up? or as part of the application process?
[09/17/2008 05:29:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am wondering because matt and leah want to redo their cabinates
[09/17/2008 05:29:48 PM] Ryan Raub: sanding the old stuff off
[09/17/2008 05:29:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you remove some of the wood?
[09/17/2008 05:30:07 PM] Ryan Raub: o yeah a bit of it
[09/17/2008 05:30:14 PM] Ryan Raub: no other way
[09/17/2008 05:30:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: what should i wipe it down with before/during/after the staining process?
[09/17/2008 05:30:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: has matt and leah even started on the cabinates?
[09/17/2008 05:31:03 PM] Ryan Raub: yeah they were doing some test stains on one of their doors
[09/17/2008 05:31:07 PM] Ryan Raub: not sure how far he got
[09/17/2008 05:31:22 PM] Ryan Raub: terry cloth rag or something for removal
[09/17/2008 05:31:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[09/17/2008 05:31:40 PM] Ryan Raub: before, id use a clean rag and/or compressed air
[09/17/2008 05:32:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: compressed air sounds better because i am not sure what rags always leave shit behind
[09/17/2008 05:32:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i might re do part of the filler, it isn't the putty stuff, infact i am pretty sure that it is saw dust mixed in with wood glue
[09/17/2008 05:33:14 PM] Ryan Raub: its meant for small gaps nothing over 1/2 inch 
[09/17/2008 05:33:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are thin long gaps
[09/17/2008 05:33:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: between the rail and the support
[09/17/2008 05:33:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it looks good
[09/17/2008 05:36:44 PM] Ryan Raub: cool
[09/17/2008 05:37:03 PM] Ryan Raub: there are a few things we could do if things didn't line up nicely besides filler, if it comes to it

[09/17/2008 06:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was thinking off even tightening some of the skrews a little further and putting it over that
[09/17/2008 06:24:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really don't think it will be very noticable after the stain goes on it

[09/18/2008 01:47:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow that is almost exactly what i need for cheaper then any other place i found
[09/18/2008 01:48:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: except i need it to be 10 inches
[09/18/2008 01:48:26 PM] Ryan Raub: u might have signal degradation problems at that length
[09/18/2008 01:48:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i could buy that, cut it in half and solder on my old ide cables
[09/18/2008 01:48:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: actually there are cables that can go up to 30 meters
[09/18/2008 01:49:20 PM] Ryan Raub: um, really? some how i doubt that
[09/18/2008 01:49:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope, there are a number of places that only have the 1m in stock
[09/18/2008 01:50:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: molex.com
[09/18/2008 01:52:22 PM] Ryan Raub: they must have insane sheilding
[09/18/2008 01:52:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: but all the sites want like 270 for the 1 meter and that's too long
