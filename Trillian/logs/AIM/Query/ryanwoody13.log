[10/12/2007 10:33:23 PM] Ryan Woodall: you'll need a lot more than a place in LA

[10/12/2007 10:52:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: that doesn't make sense
[10/12/2007 10:52:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: to see how the country would react
[10/12/2007 10:53:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: make sure it has good defense against zombies
[10/12/2007 10:54:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: we never have defense again the future stuff

[10/12/2007 10:55:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure we can defend again again terrorism, but what about aliens and zombies and vampires
[10/12/2007 10:55:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[10/12/2007 10:56:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: eventually it might happen
[10/12/2007 10:56:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha this guy in the movie says foobar
[10/12/2007 10:56:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: *fubar

[10/12/2007 10:59:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: it could happen
[10/12/2007 10:59:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: someday
[10/12/2007 11:00:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: if we allow genetic research to humans instead of monkeys and sheep, resident evil and 28 days later will all come true
[10/12/2007 11:00:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know it
[10/12/2007 11:01:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about other countries? do they outlaw genetic research?
[10/12/2007 11:01:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: 28 days later is based in britain
[10/12/2007 11:02:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: i hate you
[10/12/2007 11:02:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[10/12/2007 11:04:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: all i am saying is as soon as they extend post reconstructive growing of organs everything we see in the movies becomes a possibility 
[10/12/2007 11:05:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: shit
[10/12/2007 11:05:07 PM] Ryan Woodall: you're right
[10/12/2007 11:05:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: *past
[10/12/2007 11:05:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: hopefully none of us will be alive to see it
[10/12/2007 11:07:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: anywho
[10/12/2007 11:08:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: aside from this movie making realize how far off "it's not", you get the weekend off right?
[10/12/2007 11:08:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: any plans?
[10/12/2007 11:09:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: eh
[10/12/2007 11:09:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: depends if one of my friends calls me back or not
[10/12/2007 11:09:13 PM] Ryan Woodall: if he does, we're going out to pick up women
[10/12/2007 11:09:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: if not, then i'll be boring most of the weekend
[10/12/2007 11:09:26 PM] Ryan Woodall: i have to study for a test
[10/12/2007 11:09:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: a test in rotc?
[10/12/2007 11:10:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: gah, you're too drunk to even explain to
[10/12/2007 11:10:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i knew you were in basic
[10/12/2007 11:11:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: but if you explain it i will read over and remember tomorrow
[10/12/2007 11:13:07 PM] Ryan Woodall: haha ok
[10/12/2007 11:13:22 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm not in rotc (yet, i may be later if i decide to continue my career)
[10/12/2007 11:13:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm just training for the intelligence job i have chosen 
[10/12/2007 11:13:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: i can't get into any detail really, but it's very academically intensive, and i'm at it for 2 years
[10/12/2007 11:15:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok you didn't explain that much last time
[10/12/2007 11:16:17 PM] Ryan Woodall: rotc you do while at college just like any other college course, but it's 2 years long and you become an officer after completion
[10/12/2007 11:17:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't know you fill requirements outside of the military while you are doing basic training
[10/12/2007 11:17:52 PM] Ryan Woodall: what do you mean?  i don't know if you understand
[10/12/2007 11:18:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean you take classes that fill college requirements right?
[10/12/2007 11:18:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: I am, but most people do not
[10/12/2007 11:18:58 PM] Ryan Woodall: basic training counts for like 1 PE class, and some people's other training might transfer
[10/12/2007 11:19:16 PM] Ryan Woodall: the area of my training, however, gets me 45 credits if I complete it
[10/12/2007 11:19:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'll talk to you on the phone sometime and I can be more specific there
[10/12/2007 11:20:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, that;s good, you didn't tell me that last time, so i didn't understand
[10/12/2007 11:20:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it's not the booz
[10/12/2007 11:21:03 PM] Ryan Woodall: i still have doubts you'll remember this in the morning
[10/12/2007 11:21:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll read over
[10/12/2007 11:21:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you have a test that fulfills degree credits
[10/12/2007 11:22:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: no, it's the actual classes that fulfil credits, but I have to complete it all to get the credits
[10/12/2007 11:22:39 PM] Ryan Woodall: but completing it entails passing a very harrowing test
[10/12/2007 11:22:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: what is harrowing?
[10/12/2007 11:23:09 PM] Ryan Woodall: difficult, horrific, awe inspiring
[10/12/2007 11:24:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok sry, you have to realize i don't know anything about how the militia works
[10/12/2007 11:24:50 PM] Ryan Woodall: harrowing is just a good vocab word, nothing military
[10/12/2007 11:24:56 PM] Ryan Woodall: /vocab = lose
[10/12/2007 11:25:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah you know i suck at vocab but i got it now
[10/12/2007 11:26:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: we'll have to finish this when i am sober, but this test you have to study for is like fullfilling a PE credit?
[10/12/2007 11:27:10 PM] Ryan Woodall: well it fulfills credit, but its 45 units worth and it's not PE
[10/12/2007 11:27:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[10/12/2007 11:27:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: i can't really tell you what it would translate to at a college, as that would lead to what I am doing here, which I can't really say on something as insecure as the intraweb
[10/12/2007 11:29:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah, well that is where the confusion is, you can;t tell me, but that is understandable
[10/12/2007 11:29:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: *can't
[10/12/2007 11:29:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: that violates opsec, or operational security
[10/12/2007 11:29:58 PM] Ryan Woodall: basically something that isn't classified, but an enemy can use against us regardless
[10/12/2007 11:30:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: and they've stated that they know there are foreign operatives in monterey trying to get to us, and they are almost sure there are operatives working in this establishment trying to get to us as well
[10/12/2007 11:33:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: understandable
[10/12/2007 11:36:27 PM] Ryan Woodall: like i said, i'll give you a call tomorrow or something and fill you in
[10/12/2007 11:36:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: sounds good
[10/12/2007 11:38:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's funny how much of california they show in movies
[10/12/2007 11:38:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: well, hollywood is there
[10/12/2007 11:39:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i know, but you'd think they'd film somewhere else, just to not make it obvious
[10/12/2007 11:40:14 PM] Ryan Woodall: eh... they don't need to if people still buy tickets
[10/12/2007 11:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: true, well g2g ti bed

[12/10/2007 07:41:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: but now i feel as though when i finally find myself in a serious relationship there will be no need for sex
[12/10/2007 07:41:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's awesome
[12/10/2007 07:41:57 PM] Ryan Woodall: not entirely
[12/10/2007 07:42:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[12/10/2007 07:42:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: was it not good?
[12/10/2007 07:42:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: was it stinky?

[12/10/2007 07:42:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: no no no
[12/10/2007 07:42:57 PM] Ryan Woodall: it was just real awkward, cause it happened then i left
[12/10/2007 07:43:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: it was literally like 2 days before i was gone
[12/10/2007 07:44:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so call her up and get more sex
[12/10/2007 07:44:22 PM] Ryan Woodall: she goes to college in NY, i'm in CA

[12/10/2007 07:44:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah that would be tough
[12/10/2007 07:45:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: so does it bother you that tina is dating some other guy now, or are you over that?
[12/10/2007 07:45:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/)http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/

[12/10/2007 07:45:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: we talk ever now and then
[12/10/2007 07:46:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: it ended on good terms
[12/10/2007 07:46:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: if she was dating my best friend that would suck
[12/10/2007 07:46:35 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, just a little
[12/10/2007 07:46:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: holy fuck you lost weight
[12/10/2007 07:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: keep it off man, if you are in shape then stay in shape because it gets harder every time
[12/10/2007 07:47:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to get back to the gym
[12/10/2007 07:47:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am hiring a trainer next semester
[12/10/2007 07:48:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, well 9 weeks of constant physical exertion does that, plus now I PT every 12 hours or so
[12/10/2007 07:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: pt?
[12/10/2007 07:49:05 PM] Ryan Woodall: physical training
[12/10/2007 07:49:16 PM] Ryan Woodall: sorry, the army teaches you to use acronyms all the damn time
[12/10/2007 07:49:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh yeah
[12/10/2007 07:49:34 PM] Ryan Woodall: a trainer would be good, and if its a hot girl than that's even more motivation
[12/10/2007 07:49:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: what's the tattoo?
[12/10/2007 07:50:10 PM] Ryan Woodall: it's latin, it says "with the closest custody guard your heart, for contained within it are the sources of life"
[12/10/2007 07:50:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: good stuff
[12/10/2007 07:50:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: indeed, i'm real happy with how it turned out
[12/10/2007 07:51:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i got a miter saw for my birthday
[12/10/2007 07:51:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am tempted to cut an appendage off, just to see if it looks like they do in the movies
[12/10/2007 07:51:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha dear god
[12/10/2007 07:51:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: if you do, wait until i'm there at least
[12/10/2007 07:52:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should come back to NAU after you serve instead of ASU
[12/10/2007 07:52:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: ASU blows
[12/10/2007 07:52:24 PM] Ryan Woodall: we'll see, it's still in the air
[12/10/2007 07:52:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: it will probably be ASU though... if I do go back to ASU though I'll definitely road trip to flag to see you guys 
[12/10/2007 07:53:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah we should get high and go sledding together
[12/10/2007 07:53:16 PM] Ryan Woodall: no, that's a terrible idea
[12/10/2007 07:53:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: my friend jeffrey is going to come up from tuscan and do that with me
[12/10/2007 07:53:35 PM] Ryan Woodall: if I piss hot even once, my clearance is gone, and my career along with it
[12/10/2007 07:53:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: plus, i have no desire to either
[12/10/2007 07:54:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[12/10/2007 07:55:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: weed isn't even a real drug, it comes from the earth
[12/10/2007 07:55:49 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's what they all say...
[12/10/2007 07:55:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you go to another country where it is legal does that make it ok?
[12/10/2007 07:55:52 PM] Ryan Woodall: and the rest of them are also
[12/10/2007 07:55:55 PM] Ryan Woodall: no, not at all
[12/10/2007 07:56:13 PM] Ryan Woodall: you can still get hit with the uniform code of military justice if you are stationed in Germany or somewhere
[12/10/2007 07:56:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: our government is so subjective
[12/10/2007 07:56:55 PM] Ryan Woodall: it's intentionally that way
[12/10/2007 07:56:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: alcohol is more dangerous then weed and kills more people
[12/10/2007 07:57:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yet it is legal
[12/10/2007 07:57:24 PM] Ryan Woodall: regardless, it's still illegal and screws my clearance
[12/10/2007 07:57:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you been keeping up with slashdot?
[12/10/2007 07:57:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been following the stories on copyright
[12/10/2007 07:57:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: not really, i dont have time
[12/10/2007 07:58:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is now a law that if you computer contains copyrighted material, officials came come in you house and take your computer and auction it off
[12/10/2007 07:59:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: owned
[12/10/2007 07:59:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking ridiculous
[12/10/2007 07:59:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the RIAA sued this lady for 2 million dollars
[12/10/2007 08:00:12 PM] Ryan Woodall: just don't get caught
[12/10/2007 08:00:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: in court they made the RIAA prove the damage-per-song and somehow it came out to 240k per song
[12/10/2007 08:00:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: sharing like 21 songs
[12/10/2007 08:00:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking ridiculous
[12/10/2007 08:01:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: she was sharing on Kazaa
[12/10/2007 08:01:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: RIAA sucks, there are so many people out there sharing more music, why pick on her?
[12/10/2007 08:01:35 PM] Ryan Woodall: they could prove it
[12/10/2007 08:01:38 PM] Ryan Woodall: probably
[12/10/2007 08:01:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: they should start from the top of the list, instead of the bottom
[12/10/2007 08:02:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess they would have to spend time tracing it back to the original source
[12/10/2007 08:02:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i bet someone else knows everything we converse about
[12/10/2007 08:02:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: creepy
[12/10/2007 08:03:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: yes, i've been told very non-discreetly to watch what i say
[12/10/2007 08:03:54 PM] Ryan Woodall: as far as security things go, like stuff not even classified
[12/10/2007 08:03:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i guess i should mention my neighbors upstairs
[12/10/2007 08:04:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: class sizes, details about this post, etc.
[12/10/2007 08:04:11 PM] Ryan Woodall: what about them?
[12/10/2007 08:04:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: they piss me off
[12/10/2007 08:04:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: they TERRORIZE ME
[12/10/2007 08:04:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: how so?
[12/10/2007 08:04:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: then when the government black bags them i will buy their condo and put stairs inside
[12/10/2007 08:05:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hear every step they take
[12/10/2007 08:05:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: awesome... how do you know it's intentional?
[12/10/2007 08:05:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if we try to watch movies with the subwoofer they like jump up and down and it's really loud
[12/10/2007 08:05:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: HAHA
[12/10/2007 08:06:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: next time it happens i am going to go up there
[12/10/2007 08:08:42 PM] Ryan Woodall: don't cause too much of a confrontation
[12/10/2007 08:08:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh i will raise hell
[12/10/2007 08:11:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: so are you allowed to drink?
[12/10/2007 08:12:09 PM] Ryan Woodall: nope

[12/10/2007 08:12:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, that'll lose my clearance also
[12/10/2007 08:12:29 PM] Ryan Woodall: underage is a huge no-no
[12/10/2007 08:12:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: ohhhh

[04/17/2008 06:28:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: ugh... well that was me being ridiculously drunk, and that's just what she's like drunk
[04/17/2008 06:28:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: i was hoping everyone else was too drunk to remember also
[04/17/2008 06:28:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/17/2008 06:29:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: ... but pretty much how it stands is unless she moves to phoenix for whatever reason or i move to san francisco, things aren't going to work... so i'm not going to spend my time pining for her
[04/17/2008 06:30:14 PM] Ryan Woodall: does everyone else then, i'm assuming, remember my behavior that night?
[04/17/2008 06:31:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[04/17/2008 06:31:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're a silly fuck
[04/17/2008 06:31:35 PM] Ryan Woodall: eh... what do you mean by that?
[04/17/2008 06:31:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you guys are so cute together, you're both like "omg what do i do"
[04/17/2008 06:32:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: towards each other
[04/17/2008 06:32:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: what do you mean? i knew i was freaking out, but what did she do?
[04/17/2008 06:32:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: she was the same way
[04/17/2008 06:33:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: she thought you were mad at her for being drunk
[04/17/2008 06:33:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: ... i was a little irrated that she was making out with jenna at the time, but i have no right to say anything about that now
[04/17/2008 06:34:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: you were just jelous
[04/17/2008 06:34:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-D
[04/17/2008 06:34:58 PM] Ryan Woodall: it was more of a spill over from me being frustrated previously that week
[04/17/2008 06:35:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: it happens
[04/17/2008 06:36:22 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, pretty much... but now that she's gone, i see shit differently i guess... i can see that long distance would never work, and i'm not going to bide my time waiting for something that will probably never happen
[04/17/2008 06:36:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: this weekend we are wearing pajamas and baking cookies
[04/17/2008 06:36:49 PM] Ryan Woodall: well i won't be in this weekend, next weekend
[04/17/2008 06:37:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: we have a theme for next weekend too
[04/17/2008 06:37:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i forgot
[04/17/2008 06:37:07 PM] Ryan Woodall: ...you're a moron
[04/17/2008 06:37:19 PM] Ryan Woodall: .............. and also, if you all knew that i was getting close to jenna, and you all thought we were together, why did nobody say something to me?
[04/17/2008 06:38:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you like jenna?
[04/17/2008 06:38:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't know that
[04/17/2008 06:38:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: wait, god damnit
[04/17/2008 06:38:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you have her # and sn?
[04/17/2008 06:38:41 PM] Ryan Woodall: hold the fuck on
[04/17/2008 06:38:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was talking about your relationship with jessica
[04/17/2008 06:38:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: i know i know
[04/17/2008 06:38:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and being "not together"
[04/17/2008 06:39:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: i thought it was rather apparent that we were a little close though
[04/17/2008 06:39:01 PM] Ryan Woodall: fuck me
[04/17/2008 06:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: no thanks
[04/17/2008 06:39:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: but jenna will
[04/17/2008 06:39:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: i hate you
[04/17/2008 06:39:45 PM] Ryan Woodall: i don't know what i think about jenna, really.... we were both entirely shitfaced and got kind of close, so i need to figure it out
[04/17/2008 06:39:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: please take her off my hands
[04/17/2008 06:40:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: is she the reason you are coming back to flag?
[04/17/2008 06:40:15 PM] Ryan Woodall: i could see something there, or it could be i was just drunk and i get flirty when i'm drunk
[04/17/2008 06:40:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: no she'll do you
[04/17/2008 06:40:27 PM] Ryan Woodall: no, i'm coming back to see a bunch of people, including you and including her
[04/17/2008 06:40:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: i know god damnit
[04/17/2008 06:40:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: she takes what she can get
[04/17/2008 06:40:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: fuck, this is complicating things
[04/17/2008 06:40:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: ugh i can't stand her
[04/17/2008 06:40:52 PM] Ryan Woodall: why not?
[04/17/2008 06:40:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: she thinks she is so hot, but she is a butterface
[04/17/2008 06:41:21 PM] Ryan Woodall: you can't say that when you fucked her
[04/17/2008 06:41:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was desperatwe
[04/17/2008 06:41:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: *desperate
[04/17/2008 06:41:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: aren't you always?
[04/17/2008 06:41:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: no
[04/17/2008 06:41:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: not right now
[04/17/2008 06:42:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: eh
[04/17/2008 06:42:40 PM] Ryan Woodall: i dont know how i'd feel about fucking her after you did anyway
[04/17/2008 06:43:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: up to you
[04/17/2008 06:43:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: she's been with other guys
[04/17/2008 06:43:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: just cuz you know me?
[04/17/2008 06:43:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not like i want her
[04/17/2008 06:43:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: unless she wears a bag
[04/17/2008 06:44:19 PM] Ryan Woodall: i know she's been with other guys, and kind of because i know you
[04/17/2008 06:44:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: your dick hasn't fallen off yet right?
[04/17/2008 06:44:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: why does she have something?
[04/17/2008 06:44:52 PM] Ryan Woodall: i was using you to judge that
[04/17/2008 06:45:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think she is a horrible person, so i'm sure she would have told me, but as far as i know she is clean
[04/17/2008 06:46:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: ugh, god damnit
[04/17/2008 06:46:22 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm not going to lie, if i get drunk again and she's there we'll probably end up having sex
[04/17/2008 06:46:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: fuck... why.... damnit
[04/17/2008 06:46:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: make her wear a bag
[04/17/2008 06:46:47 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's not the issue
[04/17/2008 06:47:03 PM] Ryan Woodall: i don't think i was THAT drunk
[04/17/2008 06:47:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: that her face looks like she was beaten the fuck out of by the ugly stick?
[04/17/2008 06:47:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is that not the issue
[04/17/2008 06:47:56 PM] Ryan Woodall: the issue is i don't know if i want to fuck something up with jessica, even on the extreme extremely low possibility it might re-forge itself someday
[04/17/2008 06:48:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/17/2008 06:48:13 PM] Ryan Woodall: ....and i can't believe i told you when you hadn't realized, jesus i'm dumb
[04/17/2008 06:48:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: didn't you notice something was up when she was all over me late that night?
[04/17/2008 06:48:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: you were going to tell me eventually
[04/17/2008 06:48:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and jessica is hotter that jenna
[04/17/2008 06:48:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: we could trade
[04/17/2008 06:49:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll fuck jessica
[04/17/2008 06:49:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: you an fuck jenna
[04/17/2008 06:49:12 PM] Ryan Woodall: i hate you
[04/17/2008 06:49:18 PM] Ryan Woodall: with the passion of a thousand suns
[04/17/2008 06:49:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/17/2008 06:49:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: ..... and it's probable that neither of us will see jessica again anyway
[04/17/2008 06:50:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: she said she had fun hanging with us
[04/17/2008 06:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so maybe
[04/17/2008 06:50:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: of course she did, but she's in all likelihood going to live in sacramento, even when she gets back in 6 months
[04/17/2008 06:51:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: oh, and by the way, if you mention this shit i swear to god i don't even know what i'll do
[04/17/2008 06:51:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol i'm gonna tell jenna
[04/17/2008 06:52:03 PM] Ryan Woodall: she already knows
[04/17/2008 06:52:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: does keifer know?
[04/17/2008 06:52:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: i facebooked her and IMed her just because i had to get it out of my system
[04/17/2008 06:52:23 PM] Ryan Woodall: jesus i hope not
[04/17/2008 06:52:26 PM] Ryan Woodall: if he fucking does it's over
[04/17/2008 06:52:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol i should tell keifer
[04/17/2008 06:53:15 PM] Ryan Woodall: you don't even know what you will unleash
[04/17/2008 06:53:27 PM] Ryan Woodall: i will hunt you to the far corners of the earth
[04/17/2008 06:53:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/17/2008 06:53:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: you're so worried
[04/17/2008 06:53:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: chill man chill
[04/17/2008 06:53:52 PM] Ryan Woodall: alright fine
[04/17/2008 06:54:05 PM] Ryan Woodall: this shit has just been on my mind a little, if you couldnt' tell
[04/17/2008 06:54:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you're going to get some? how did jenna respond?
[04/17/2008 06:55:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: ... and on a side note, did you find my knife / lighter or anything else i left?
[04/17/2008 06:55:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: your knife, your shirt, and her sock
[04/17/2008 06:55:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: my shirt? which shirt?
[04/17/2008 06:55:51 PM] Ryan Woodall: ... and no lighter? that's what i wanted most
[04/17/2008 06:56:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: haven't seen it
[04/17/2008 06:56:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: fuck

[04/19/2008 07:16:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was having a party moron
[04/19/2008 07:16:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: so anyways
[04/19/2008 07:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i found your lighter
[04/19/2008 07:16:21 PM] Ryan Woodall: out fucking standing
[04/19/2008 07:16:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: where was it?
[04/19/2008 07:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it was in the couch
[04/19/2008 07:16:39 PM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha
[04/19/2008 07:16:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh and i wanted to tell you jenna is fucking dirty
[04/19/2008 07:16:55 PM] Ryan Woodall: in what way?
[04/19/2008 07:16:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: and my cock might as well have fallen off
[04/19/2008 07:17:18 PM] Ryan Woodall: explain
[04/19/2008 07:17:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i plan to
[04/19/2008 07:17:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: so about a month ago keifer and jenna spent the night together
[04/19/2008 07:18:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: jenna broke up with her dirty ass 2 month fling and was all upset
[04/19/2008 07:18:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so 2 weeks ago keifer starts getting itchy spots
[04/19/2008 07:18:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been having this irritating skin itch for like 3 months and it's been driving me nuts
[04/19/2008 07:19:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: well guess who i spent the night with 3 months ago
[04/19/2008 07:19:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so this bitch is so fucking stupid she doesn't even realize it yet
[04/19/2008 07:19:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i talked to her a couple days ago and told her keifer and i have this same problem
[04/19/2008 07:19:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she is the only one we have in common
[04/19/2008 07:20:02 PM] Ryan Woodall: ha, you mean itchy spots on your dick?
[04/19/2008 07:20:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so she either lies through her teeth when she told me she has never had that irritation, or shes just a fucking dumbass because keifer was over there the other day and SAW fucking spots all over her, and she was itching them
[04/19/2008 07:21:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so keifer and i think we have it figured out, it is called scabies, it's a type of body mite
[04/19/2008 07:21:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: ha, i don't know if either of you are qualified to make a diagnosis
[04/19/2008 07:21:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck you douche
[04/19/2008 07:21:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: keifer went to fronske and they told him what it was
[04/19/2008 07:22:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha
[04/19/2008 07:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it can irritate any part of your body, and you can catch it from sharing a bed with someone, hence how keifer got it (from non intimate contant), and how i got it, from making a mistake
[04/19/2008 07:22:39 PM] Ryan Woodall: what did they tell him to do about it?
[04/19/2008 07:23:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: treating it is just like treating lice, but the mites don't live very long without a host, you have to suffocate or poison them all over your body, and wash everything
[04/19/2008 07:24:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: the annoying thing is, the itching is an allergic reaction to the mites, so it won't go away for like 2 weeks after you treat it
[04/19/2008 07:25:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: so she is fucking dirty
[04/19/2008 07:25:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she is either a bitch or a dumbass for lying to us about it
[04/19/2008 07:26:09 PM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha
[04/19/2008 07:26:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: now that i think of it, last time she spent the night i remember noticing her itching
[04/19/2008 07:26:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: so fuck her, this is like the almost STD, and she is completely irresponsible
[04/19/2008 07:27:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: i don't suppose either of you are going to inform her of this
[04/19/2008 07:27:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: we both tried but shes too fuckin dense to realize it
[04/19/2008 07:29:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways
[04/19/2008 07:29:23 PM] Ryan Woodall: what do you mean you tried? can't you just say "hey, you have some shit"
[04/19/2008 07:29:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i did
[04/19/2008 07:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and shes to fuckin proud to admit that maybe it came from her
[04/19/2008 07:30:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i highly discourage you from pursuing her. even you can do better.
[04/19/2008 07:30:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: hey man i never said i was going to pursue her
[04/19/2008 07:30:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[04/19/2008 07:31:03 PM] Ryan Woodall: i just said i didn't knw what i was going to do about it
[04/19/2008 07:31:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: well now you know what you are going to do about it
[04/19/2008 07:31:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: leave it alone
[04/19/2008 07:31:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: however, shouldn't i have it too then, if it came from her?
[04/19/2008 07:32:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: close physical contant
[04/19/2008 07:32:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm pretty sure you didn't spend the night with her with little amount of clothing
[04/19/2008 07:33:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, she was all over me, and that was the shirtless night
[04/19/2008 07:33:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you were lucky
[04/19/2008 07:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: it takes a little time too
[04/19/2008 07:33:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it takes 2 weeks for it to kick in with the itching
[04/19/2008 07:34:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you have a half a week right?
[04/19/2008 07:34:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: ha, we'll find out then
[04/19/2008 07:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you may just be lucky
[04/19/2008 07:37:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you really want to take the chance?
[04/19/2008 07:39:45 PM] Ryan Woodall: no, not really i'm just irritated because that deprives me of my safety, someone i can just fuck when i need something quick and easy
[04/19/2008 07:40:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah no quick fucking for you
[04/19/2008 07:40:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes gross
[04/19/2008 07:40:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: we'll find you another quick fuck
[04/19/2008 07:40:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: or a long slow fuck
[04/19/2008 07:40:39 PM] Ryan Woodall: haha
[04/19/2008 07:40:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: like this one girl i like
[04/19/2008 07:40:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg
[04/19/2008 07:41:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: there are some attractive females at your last party
[04/19/2008 07:41:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would fuck her long and slow
[04/19/2008 07:41:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: and takes some stimulants and fuck her more
[04/19/2008 07:41:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah Elise is fucking amazing
[04/19/2008 07:41:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: shes like the perfect woman
[04/19/2008 07:41:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: damnit, i was eying her too
[04/19/2008 07:41:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: but she doesn't use the computer much so i would have to fix that
[04/19/2008 07:42:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah dave is after her too
[04/19/2008 07:42:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: and travis is after her
[04/19/2008 07:42:11 PM] Ryan Woodall: shit
[04/19/2008 07:42:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she has a pretty serious boyfriend
[04/19/2008 07:42:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: oh, well that's a no-go then
[04/19/2008 07:42:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: you dave and travis i could handle
[04/19/2008 07:42:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'll be there for her if that ever changes
[04/19/2008 07:42:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: LOL
[04/19/2008 07:43:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: when was the last time you got some?
[04/19/2008 07:43:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: how much is some?
[04/19/2008 07:43:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: intimately laid a hand on a woman
[04/19/2008 07:43:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: who laid her hand back on you
[04/19/2008 07:44:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: since jessica left

[04/19/2008 07:44:43 PM] Ryan Woodall: damnit, which one?
[04/19/2008 07:44:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am a smooth criminal when it comes to women
[04/19/2008 07:44:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not telling you
[04/19/2008 07:45:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: if you say so
[04/19/2008 07:45:05 PM] Ryan Woodall: et
[04/19/2008 07:45:11 PM] Ryan Woodall: *wtf
[04/19/2008 07:45:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: i need to know so i don't make a pass at the same one
[04/19/2008 07:46:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[04/19/2008 07:46:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: you won't
[04/19/2008 07:46:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: how do you know?

[04/19/2008 07:48:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can tell you right now, they are both interested in other things
[04/19/2008 07:48:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: ? other things, not other people?
[04/19/2008 07:50:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: other things, and other people
[04/19/2008 07:50:42 PM] Ryan Woodall: damnit

[04/19/2008 07:55:23 PM] Ryan Woodall: ....
[04/19/2008 07:55:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: meh
[04/19/2008 07:55:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: damnit
[04/19/2008 07:56:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: you fucked up my first plan, you need to find me another
[04/19/2008 07:56:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's not my fault jenna is fuckin gross
[04/19/2008 07:56:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: would you rather i not warned you?
[04/19/2008 07:56:49 PM] Ryan Woodall: almost
[04/19/2008 07:58:29 PM] Ryan Woodall: at least now if i get drunk and have sex with her anyway i won't have an excuse
[04/19/2008 07:59:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am absolutely not inviting her to any more parties
[04/19/2008 07:59:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: so good luck with that
[04/19/2008 07:59:13 PM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha
[04/19/2008 07:59:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if you invite her, i will hate you
[04/19/2008 07:59:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: oh, well look who just returned from being away...
[04/19/2008 07:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: she left marks from her gay ass belt all over my walls too
[04/19/2008 08:00:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, well i told her that if i showed up i would invite her... before of course you talked to me.  i'll have to find a way out of this one
[04/19/2008 08:00:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, please do
[04/19/2008 08:00:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: not to mention she's needy
[04/19/2008 08:00:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you really want to make that mistake?
[04/19/2008 08:00:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: hey, i live 5 hours away
[04/19/2008 08:00:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm pretty sure i could get away
[04/19/2008 08:01:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: gross....
[04/19/2008 08:02:15 PM] Ryan Woodall: damnit, you really do suck
[04/19/2008 08:02:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: and on a side note, does joanna know keifer slept with her?
[04/19/2008 08:02:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: she didn't "sleep" with each other
[04/19/2008 08:02:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: they spent the night in the same bed
[04/19/2008 08:03:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and yes she does know
[04/19/2008 08:05:18 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm trying to figure out how i can do this diplomatically
[04/19/2008 08:05:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: just don't call her
[04/19/2008 08:05:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: bfg
[04/19/2008 08:05:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: big fucking gun?
[04/19/2008 08:06:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i meant bfd
[04/19/2008 08:06:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: big fucking deal
[04/19/2008 08:06:21 PM] Ryan Woodall: you know i hate you for this right?
[04/19/2008 08:06:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: stfu i am protecting your cock
[04/19/2008 08:07:01 PM] Ryan Woodall: i haven't been affected yet have i?
[04/19/2008 08:07:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and with my help you won't be
[04/19/2008 08:07:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: i mean there was some pretty prolonged, close physical contact like 3 weeks ago and no itching yet
[04/19/2008 08:07:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you got lucky
[04/19/2008 08:08:45 PM] Ryan Woodall: god damnit you
[04/19/2008 08:10:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: fine, but you better make sure there's somebody i can hit on friday
[04/19/2008 08:10:49 PM] Ryan Woodall: or saturday
[04/19/2008 08:10:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/19/2008 08:11:15 PM] Ryan Woodall: someone attractive and single, preferably
[04/19/2008 08:11:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine
[04/19/2008 08:11:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: "I think I have it under cunt roll" - this girl from the party
[04/19/2008 08:11:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: pretty funny
[04/19/2008 08:12:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: wait, what?
[04/19/2008 08:12:41 PM] Ryan Woodall: that didn't make sense
[04/19/2008 08:12:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was talking to her
[04/19/2008 08:12:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what she said to me
[04/19/2008 08:13:07 PM] Ryan Woodall: what was she referring to?
[04/19/2008 08:13:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: she ackzually said cunt
[04/19/2008 08:13:50 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's impressive actually, jessica was about the only other girl i knew that didn't mind that word
[04/19/2008 08:14:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i want to fuck jessica too
[04/19/2008 08:14:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't mind do you?
[04/19/2008 08:15:40 PM] Ryan Woodall: if you say that to me in person, i'm probably going to hit you
[04/19/2008 08:16:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude wtf, it's not like you guys ever dated
[04/19/2008 08:16:29 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's exactly what it was, we dated but we were never in a relationship
[04/19/2008 08:17:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: *dude wtf, it's not like you guys ever in a relationship
[04/19/2008 08:17:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you care, you're not going to get any from her now
[04/19/2008 08:17:28 PM] Ryan Woodall: i don't fucking care
[04/19/2008 08:17:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: it's still a posibility, just one further down the line
[04/19/2008 08:17:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, ok
[04/19/2008 08:19:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: seriously, i'm not even joking, i would probably hit you, especially drunk
[04/19/2008 08:19:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: fine
[04/19/2008 08:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i won't fuck her
[04/19/2008 08:19:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i could
[04/19/2008 08:19:48 PM] Ryan Woodall: nope
[04/19/2008 08:19:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know, i am going to help you
[04/19/2008 08:20:02 PM] Ryan Woodall: how so?
[04/19/2008 08:21:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are going to make you less of a □
[04/19/2008 08:21:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: i don't think i need any help with that
[04/19/2008 08:22:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: that situation is just a little too... complicated for me to be able to joke about
[04/19/2008 08:22:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha
[04/19/2008 08:22:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[04/19/2008 08:22:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: doesn't mean that you have the ability to lock it down
[04/19/2008 08:22:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what you have to do
[04/19/2008 08:22:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: be deterministic like a turing machine
[04/19/2008 08:22:45 PM] Ryan Woodall: not while she's in basic training obviously not
[04/19/2008 08:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: see like that
[04/19/2008 08:22:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: you fool
[04/19/2008 08:23:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: you used not twice in the same sentence
[04/19/2008 08:23:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: shut up, there was a semi-colon there
[04/19/2008 08:23:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: you are too insecure when it comes to women
[04/19/2008 08:24:26 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's certainly how i used to be, but i've got it covered now
[04/19/2008 08:24:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: i was insecure about jessica because I knew that she was leaving and it was probably going to end
[04/19/2008 08:25:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: really? because last time we hung out, not much had changed
[04/19/2008 08:25:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: ...along with other things i'm not going to get into, but rest assured i had reasons to be insecure
[04/19/2008 08:25:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: you got thinner, you are better looking when you're in shape
[04/19/2008 08:25:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to act on that
[04/19/2008 08:25:44 PM] Ryan Woodall: no shit dude
[04/19/2008 08:25:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: why do you think i dated jessica, along with some other women in monterey
[04/19/2008 08:26:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you also have to keep your ego under control
[04/19/2008 08:26:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: something you have always, and clearly still do, have a problem with
[04/19/2008 08:26:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't want to tell you this at the time because i didn't want to hurt your feelings
[04/19/2008 08:26:50 PM] Ryan Woodall: haha, that's not always a problem
[04/19/2008 08:27:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: she told me she wasn't interested in a relationship with you
[04/19/2008 08:27:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that is the god honest truth
[04/19/2008 08:27:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i know you probably still won't believe me
[04/19/2008 08:27:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: well i realize she wasn't at the moment
[04/19/2008 08:27:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: now if she meant long term, then that's news to me
[04/19/2008 08:27:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: she made it pretty clear there wasn't any feelings there
[04/19/2008 08:28:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: so take it as you will, but there are other women that would be better suited
[04/19/2008 08:28:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: and they aren't too hard to find
[04/19/2008 08:28:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: oh i know that
[04/19/2008 08:28:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've met 3 girls i was genuinely interested in this semester alone, now it is just a waiting game
[04/19/2008 08:29:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: if that is true, it would be a little bit of an ego hit though, because all the other evidence begs to differ
[04/19/2008 08:29:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: so this weekend is going to be really good practice for us
[04/19/2008 08:30:55 PM] Ryan Woodall: hey, like i said i've moved on, at least until 6 months later and apparently for good now
[04/19/2008 08:31:14 PM] Ryan Woodall: like i said, just make sure there are attractive, single women there and i'll practice all you want
[04/19/2008 08:31:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i am saying don't wait for something that could quite possibly never happen
[04/19/2008 08:31:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: besides unavailable men are 10x hotter then needy ones
[04/19/2008 08:32:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: so if you pick up an arm ornament in the next six months, your chances of getting with jessica will be way increased
[04/19/2008 08:32:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: i never said i was going to wait, i was just talking about fucking jenna... i said in 6 months i'll re-examine the situation
[04/19/2008 08:32:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude don't fuck jenna
[04/19/2008 08:32:48 PM] Ryan Woodall: ...and i don't think that will be, or should be my motivation
[04/19/2008 08:32:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you have to have standards
[04/19/2008 08:33:03 PM] Ryan Woodall: hey, that conversation is long over
[04/19/2008 08:33:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: you already convinced me
[04/19/2008 08:33:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: being attractive is a good goal to have, i am confused
[04/19/2008 08:33:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: what?
[04/19/2008 08:33:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: [04/19/2008 08:32:48 PM] Ryan Woodall: ...and i don't think that will be, or should be my motivation
[04/19/2008 08:34:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: wtf did you mean
[04/19/2008 08:34:51 PM] Ryan Woodall: that my motivation should be to find an arm ornament to win back jessica or something
[04/19/2008 08:35:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, i am just saying find ways to appeal to women that you like
[04/19/2008 08:35:21 PM] Ryan Woodall: i've already resigned to the fact that it was not, in all probability, going to work, i've moved on now

[04/20/2008 12:22:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i feel like i need to start meeting military women, civilian women aren't as emotionally available as the put on
[04/20/2008 12:22:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think we can help each other
[04/20/2008 12:22:45 AM] Ryan Woodall: hahaha
[04/20/2008 12:23:01 AM] Ryan Woodall: i've realized that all military women are incredibly fucked up in the head
[04/20/2008 12:23:10 AM] Ryan Woodall: like, freud would spend his whole life analyzing them
[04/20/2008 12:23:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am good at dealing with fucked up women
[04/20/2008 12:24:42 AM] Ryan Woodall: i don't know that you'd want this much fucked-up-ness

[04/20/2008 12:25:14 AM] Ryan Woodall: like i mean most of them were abused, have attachement or detachement issues, or were beaten at some point in their lives
[04/20/2008 12:26:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: all they need a little sensitivity and compassion
[04/20/2008 12:26:10 AM] Ryan Woodall: i doubt it
[04/20/2008 12:26:21 AM] Ryan Woodall: more likely a psycologist and 3 years

[04/21/2008 09:39:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i express myself better on paper/webpage then i do in person
[04/21/2008 09:39:27 AM] Ryan Woodall: haha, probably... but i'm not joking, i didn't know you could write that coherently
[04/21/2008 09:39:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: google's define keyword, and microsoft word's synonyms 
[04/21/2008 09:40:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: i generally use the synonyms to make sure i am using the word correctly
[04/21/2008 09:40:39 AM] Ryan Woodall: at least it made sense, many people try to do that and just fail
[04/21/2008 09:41:00 AM] Ryan Woodall: now just start using words like that in speech and you'll be set
[04/21/2008 09:43:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol yeah

[04/21/2008 09:45:44 AM] Ryan Woodall: haha
[04/21/2008 09:46:31 AM] Ryan Woodall: i've started talking to this girl i met on the internet the other day who lives by me... she's an officer in the airforce, and her father is a 3 star general in the army
[04/21/2008 09:46:40 AM] Ryan Woodall: that, on one hand, scares the shit out of me, and on the other hand is incredibly sexy
[04/21/2008 09:46:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude airforce chicks are so fuckin hot
[04/21/2008 09:47:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i had a teacher that i wanted to fuck, she was in the airforce and was totally hot

[04/21/2008 09:47:42 AM] Ryan Woodall: oh, she's hot... though i'm a little intimidated that techincally i would have to salute her in uniform

[06/09/2008 07:40:41 AM] Ryan Woodall: i dont have that one for some strange reason
[06/09/2008 07:55:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: hot
[06/09/2008 07:55:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: the level of abstraction that i have implemented is ridiculous
[06/09/2008 07:56:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: it makes this kind of system perfect

[06/09/2008 12:44:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what google is for
[06/09/2008 12:44:40 PM] Ryan Woodall: i dont have the time

[06/09/2008 08:15:51 PM] Ryan Woodall: brian, you back?
[06/09/2008 08:16:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: back from my nap
[06/09/2008 08:16:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[06/09/2008 08:16:10 PM] Ryan Woodall: not a whole lot
[06/09/2008 08:16:17 PM] Ryan Woodall: i still dont understand abstraction
[06/09/2008 08:17:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: so basically i implemented this entire gui thing without changing any of the backend of the site
[06/09/2008 08:17:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i implemented a new template for returning the files in XML instead of an html list like before, and everything else is javascript
[06/09/2008 08:17:37 PM] Ryan Woodall: oh ok
[06/09/2008 08:17:42 PM] Ryan Woodall: how come you abandoned php?
[06/09/2008 08:18:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: it uses php, that is what the backend is written in, but i don't need the php to control how it is displayed
[06/09/2008 08:19:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is called a model/view/controller abstraction
[06/09/2008 08:19:30 PM] Ryan Woodall: that makes a little sense
[06/09/2008 08:20:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: my data modal is the data base information, my controller is the user input processed by the php, and my view is a template system and javascript
[06/09/2008 08:20:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i can have multiple views without changing the data model or the controller
[06/09/2008 08:20:25 PM] Ryan Woodall: got it
[06/09/2008 08:20:29 PM] Ryan Woodall: that sounds pretty hot
[06/09/2008 08:22:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, i have really been polishing up the folder
[06/09/2008 08:23:00 PM] Ryan Woodall: it's looking better from when i saw it a couple days ago even
[06/09/2008 08:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah it is turning out really good
[06/09/2008 08:24:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: still need to fix the item selector
[06/09/2008 08:24:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: and add some buffer items
[06/09/2008 08:25:40 PM] Ryan Woodall: sounds good
[06/09/2008 08:26:01 PM] Ryan Woodall: so, i have a question for you
[06/09/2008 08:26:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: whats up?
[06/09/2008 08:27:02 PM] Ryan Woodall: if i were to tell you that christina and i have been talking a lot recently, and it's a possibility that we end up dating in the future, what would you say?
[06/09/2008 08:27:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha gross
[06/09/2008 08:28:08 PM] Ryan Woodall: why do you say that?
[06/09/2008 08:28:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just lost interest in her towards the end of our relationshjp
[06/09/2008 08:29:46 PM] Ryan Woodall: well that's better than i expected you to react
[06/09/2008 08:30:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: it ended on good terms, so i guess i dont mind
[06/09/2008 08:30:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: thanks for asking though
[06/09/2008 08:30:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: she doesn't talk to me anymore
[06/09/2008 08:30:42 PM] Ryan Woodall: no problem... i wanted to make sure you would be alright with it
[06/09/2008 08:30:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe she blocked me, i never see her on
[06/09/2008 08:31:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: i think she did, hahaha
[06/09/2008 08:31:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know why i was never mean to her
[06/09/2008 08:31:24 PM] Ryan Woodall: i mean...
[06/09/2008 08:31:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: weird
[06/09/2008 08:31:29 PM] Ryan Woodall: i can neither confirm nor deny
[06/09/2008 08:31:32 PM] Ryan Woodall: hah
[06/09/2008 08:31:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wanted to rant about smallville with her
[06/09/2008 08:32:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it just got too painful because she still loves me
[06/09/2008 08:32:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i have a hot girlfriend now
[06/09/2008 08:32:38 PM] Ryan Woodall: lol
[06/09/2008 08:32:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: whos brains i am going to fuck out this weekend
[06/09/2008 08:32:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[06/09/2008 08:34:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: well i'm glad you don't mind, maybe if this works out we'll all hang out sometimes
[06/09/2008 08:34:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you date her, i am having a 3 way with jessica
[06/09/2008 08:35:04 PM] Ryan Woodall: i reserve that before you do :P
[06/09/2008 08:36:14 PM] Ryan Woodall: but you'll probably never see her again
[06/09/2008 08:42:11 PM] Ryan Woodall: and neither will i of course
[06/09/2008 08:42:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: hm
[06/09/2008 08:42:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i txted her
[06/09/2008 08:42:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: no response
[06/09/2008 08:42:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh well
[06/09/2008 08:42:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: she's in basic training
[06/09/2008 08:42:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you should ask christina why she blocked me
[06/09/2008 08:43:21 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm pretty sure she still thinks you're an asshole
[06/09/2008 08:45:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: why!?
[06/09/2008 08:45:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: what did i ever do
[06/09/2008 08:46:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: she broke up with me
[06/09/2008 08:46:36 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's not my story to tell, honestly
[06/09/2008 08:46:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: whatever
[06/09/2008 08:47:01 PM] Ryan Woodall: i'm trying to remain unbiased in that whole situation... but i have a feeling the fact that you don't know would anger her
[06/09/2008 08:47:06 PM] Ryan Woodall: or at least irk her
[06/09/2008 08:51:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: could you elaborate a little more?
[06/09/2008 08:51:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: what don't i know?
[06/09/2008 08:52:34 PM] Ryan Woodall: that you don't know why she's angry... I'm going to say nothing more than that i think the phrase "i wish you were my first" really bothered her, especially when she was still getting over the break up
[06/09/2008 08:54:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: ph
[06/09/2008 08:54:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[06/09/2008 08:55:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[06/09/2008 08:55:38 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah, that might have been part of it
[06/09/2008 08:55:53 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's it though, i don't want to get in the middle of this, it could harm things on both ends
[06/09/2008 09:02:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: well
[06/09/2008 09:02:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: the only reason i said that is because it would have been better with her
[06/09/2008 09:03:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: it kind of sucked
[06/09/2008 09:03:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: but at least with her i would have been comfortable
[06/09/2008 09:03:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: and she dated another guy! when i said that
[06/09/2008 09:03:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: she seemed pretty over it to me
[06/09/2008 09:04:02 PM] Ryan Woodall: she's just gotten over it very recently
[06/09/2008 09:04:07 PM] Ryan Woodall: other guys = rebounds
[06/09/2008 09:04:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[06/09/2008 09:04:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't even need a reboud
[06/09/2008 09:04:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: *rebound
[06/09/2008 09:05:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was playing the happy bachelor
[06/09/2008 09:05:55 PM] Ryan Woodall: well you dealt with it differently then... whatever.  again, i dont want to wedge myself in the middle, but know that she was disturbed by it
[06/09/2008 09:06:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[06/09/2008 09:06:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: is she still trumping the V card?
[06/09/2008 09:06:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: i haven't directly asked, but i'm sure she is
[06/09/2008 09:07:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see
[06/09/2008 09:08:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to worry about getting in the middle, i am just asking because she's not on/blocked me
[06/09/2008 09:09:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am pretty indifferent about the whole thing
[06/09/2008 09:09:18 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah
[06/09/2008 09:12:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i was kind of stupid at the time, but i thought she might be flattered
[06/09/2008 09:13:31 PM] Ryan Woodall: well i'll let her know that you didn't intend to hurt her with it
[06/09/2008 09:14:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean sex was never as big of a deal to me as it was to her
[06/09/2008 09:17:15 PM] Ryan Woodall: yeah
[06/09/2008 09:17:19 PM] Ryan Woodall: i picked up on that

[07/09/2008 07:50:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: why pt?

[07/13/2008 10:36:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: actually i wanted to tell you, because you asked the last time you wanted to hook up with a girl i knew
[07/13/2008 10:36:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: and because i don't think this particular girl knows or will admit it
[07/13/2008 10:36:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: i got oral herpes from christina
[07/13/2008 10:36:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: so don't make out so much if she has a sore

[07/13/2008 10:38:18 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was horribly painful
[07/13/2008 10:39:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: through research i found that it can spread to the genitals, at any time but the chances are unlikely if there isn't a breakout

[07/13/2008 10:41:06 AM] Ryan Woodall: *future
[07/13/2008 10:41:57 AM] Ryan Woodall: this, i didn't know though: Because the virus is highly contagious, most people have been infected by at least 1 herpes subtype before adulthood.

[07/13/2008 10:53:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: we are kind of territorial
[07/13/2008 10:53:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: and we have expanded our massive array of electronics and there isn't really enough room for another desk and bed
[07/13/2008 10:53:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i was going to suggest richard
[07/13/2008 10:54:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: his roommate is old and might be getting out soon

[07/13/2008 11:24:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think you would have seperate rooms
[07/13/2008 11:24:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: so that would eliminate the only problem i have with him
[07/13/2008 11:24:39 AM] Brian Cullinan: he gets messy when he is busy and can't find time to clean up his shit
[07/13/2008 11:25:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: and he lets his alarm go off every 10 minutes 10 times before he gets up
[07/13/2008 11:25:33 AM] Ryan Woodall: is it just him and one other person?
[07/13/2008 11:27:22 AM] Ryan Woodall: that i could deal with, i'll have to give him a call
[07/13/2008 11:28:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: not sure you will have to talk to him
[07/13/2008 11:31:04 AM] Ryan Woodall: what are you going to do when your brother moves in?

[07/13/2008 11:47:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: use it or lose it bro, use it or lose it
[07/13/2008 11:47:47 AM] Ryan Woodall: well that's your opionion... i've used it, and it's not worth all the drama and shittiness that follows inevitably
[07/13/2008 11:48:03 AM] Ryan Woodall: and i'm pretty sure i'm not going to lose it
[07/13/2008 11:48:49 AM] Ryan Woodall: ...but anyway, i'm going to eat lunch, i'll talk to you later
[07/13/2008 11:56:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha drama and shittiness?

[07/13/2008 12:13:20 PM] Ryan Woodall: tell that to christina
[07/13/2008 12:26:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha
[07/13/2008 12:26:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: it was never a problem during our relationship
[07/13/2008 12:26:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: she doesn't speak to me now, so what do i care

[07/13/2008 12:28:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's what you think... she never wanted to get physical, it was to make you happy

[07/13/2008 12:30:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's what i mean, she is definitely sexually immature, and the thing with jenna had nothing to do with fooling around, i got some itchy shit from her and thought it was pretty gross, i don't have to deal with her anymore either
[07/13/2008 12:31:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i stopped talking to her and got a girlfriend and fell in love, the only drama i heard about was from keifer he told me she was upset, still no drama
