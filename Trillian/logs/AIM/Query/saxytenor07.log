[05/13/2009 03:58:16 AM] Erika Fournier: I think I just need to accept defeat
[05/13/2009 03:58:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: i always wait until the last minute to tell my parents the bad news, that way they can't question my decisions because everything is already done
[05/13/2009 03:58:43 AM] Brian Cullinan: i have a class like that
[05/13/2009 03:58:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i am not in any rush to finish school
