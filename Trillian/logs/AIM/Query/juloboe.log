[09/27/2007 02:29:54 PM] Julie Anderson: But let's see, tonight I only have one homework assignment to do. Not too bad.
[09/27/2007 02:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm a little embarrassed, usually its not this hard for me to get a date
[09/27/2007 02:30:11 PM] Julie Anderson: it's usually easy?
[09/27/2007 02:31:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: usually
[09/27/2007 02:31:11 PM] Julie Anderson: you're a lucky guy then.
[09/27/2007 02:31:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, i'm really kind of picky
[09/27/2007 02:32:04 PM] Julie Anderson: I have many reasons for not making this easy for you. :D
[09/27/2007 02:33:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: haha, well games are fun.  the reason i'm so interested is because you seem like an intelligent person
[09/27/2007 02:33:48 PM] Julie Anderson: That's good.
[09/27/2007 02:34:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd really like to get to know you.
[09/27/2007 02:34:08 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm surprised you've actually played Myst.
[09/27/2007 02:34:17 PM] Julie Anderson: Most people I've talked to think it's boring.
[09/27/2007 02:35:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg i love myst
[09/27/2007 02:35:20 PM] Julie Anderson: :)
[09/27/2007 02:35:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure i asked you this the other day, have you played riven and exile?
[09/27/2007 02:35:32 PM] Julie Anderson: YES
[09/27/2007 02:35:36 PM] Julie Anderson: oops
[09/27/2007 02:35:39 PM] Julie Anderson: yes
[09/27/2007 02:35:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have both
[09/27/2007 02:35:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: what about myst 4?
[09/27/2007 02:35:46 PM] Julie Anderson: me too
[09/27/2007 02:35:50 PM] Julie Anderson: I have all of them
[09/27/2007 02:35:57 PM] Julie Anderson: but I have yet to beat Myst 4 and 5
[09/27/2007 02:36:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i haven't gone through either of those
[09/27/2007 02:36:18 PM] Julie Anderson: do you have myst 4?
[09/27/2007 02:36:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[09/27/2007 02:36:47 PM] Julie Anderson: ok, random question, I don't remember if I asked you or not--- do you play an instrument?
[09/27/2007 02:36:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used to play trumpet
[09/27/2007 02:37:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might play with my highschool this weekend
[09/27/2007 02:37:23 PM] Julie Anderson: oh ok cool
[09/27/2007 02:37:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i used to practice just enough to play the required music, so i could only hit the high notes if we had to in songs
[09/27/2007 02:37:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was an OK player
[09/27/2007 02:37:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you religious?
[09/27/2007 02:38:04 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 02:38:16 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm very religious actually.
[09/27/2007 02:38:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you morman?
[09/27/2007 02:38:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: what religion?
[09/27/2007 02:38:36 PM] Julie Anderson: yes. How'd you guess?
[09/27/2007 02:38:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahahaha
[09/27/2007 02:38:50 PM] Julie Anderson: What religion are you?
[09/27/2007 02:39:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: *sigh*
[09/27/2007 02:39:26 PM] Julie Anderson: Change your mind about asking me on a date?
[09/27/2007 02:39:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am christian
[09/27/2007 02:39:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i'm not sure
[09/27/2007 02:39:55 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 02:40:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i guessed morman because you said very religious, other christians would have answered with "i am christian" so that was ruled out
[09/27/2007 02:40:30 PM] Julie Anderson: I am Christian.
[09/27/2007 02:40:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: morman is a type is Christianity that is true.
[09/27/2007 02:41:21 PM] Julie Anderson: Though I suppose our beliefs have some differences.
[09/27/2007 02:41:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is true
[09/27/2007 02:41:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: is that why you were making it so difficult for me to get a date?
[09/27/2007 02:42:11 PM] Julie Anderson: partly, but like I said, I have many reasons
[09/27/2007 02:42:27 PM] Julie Anderson: another is that I had just barely met you
[09/27/2007 02:42:55 PM] Julie Anderson: and I did already have plans...
[09/27/2007 02:43:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, that's why dates are so great because there is so much time to get to know the person
[09/27/2007 02:44:30 PM] Julie Anderson: yes it's true
[09/27/2007 02:45:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: where do you live?
[09/27/2007 02:45:23 PM] Julie Anderson: University meadows
[09/27/2007 02:47:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i think you are very attractive, and i am not going to change my mind about getting a date with you just because of your religion
[09/27/2007 02:48:01 PM] Julie Anderson: good. I'm glad. I was wondering if that would change your mind.
[09/27/2007 02:49:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i believe that religion doesn't define a person
[09/27/2007 02:49:50 PM] Julie Anderson: Perhaps not, but it can have a huge influence.
[09/27/2007 02:50:31 PM] Julie Anderson: what kind of christian are you?
[09/27/2007 02:50:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am not a hypochristian if that's what you are getting at
[09/27/2007 02:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i don't go to church very often
[09/27/2007 02:51:19 PM] Julie Anderson: what's a hypochristian?
[09/27/2007 02:51:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: a christian that expresses their beliefs then does things that contradict them
[09/27/2007 02:51:47 PM] Julie Anderson: oh ok
[09/27/2007 02:51:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: like lots of sex
[09/27/2007 02:52:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am very passionate about my beliefs, and i pray and read the bible, but i don't go to church every weekend
[09/27/2007 02:52:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of morman are you?
[09/27/2007 02:52:41 PM] Julie Anderson: Ok. Whatever works for you. You seem like a really good person.
[09/27/2007 02:53:01 PM] Julie Anderson: Are there different kinds of Mormons?
[09/27/2007 02:53:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are the kind with arranged marriages
[09/27/2007 02:53:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: the kinds that don't drink caffine
[09/27/2007 02:53:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the kind that move out of Utah and enjoy life
[09/27/2007 02:53:43 PM] Julie Anderson: there are???? I haven't heard of any arranged marriages.
[09/27/2007 02:54:35 PM] Julie Anderson: the caffeine might be true with a very few amount of people. With that I think it's okay as long as you're not addicted.
[09/27/2007 02:54:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, you're a very interesting person
[09/27/2007 02:55:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: you've never heard of mormans arranging a marraige?
[09/27/2007 02:55:17 PM] Julie Anderson: and there are Utah mormons. I never want to live in Utah because of that.
[09/27/2007 02:55:27 PM] Julie Anderson: nope never
[09/27/2007 02:55:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats a pretty big part a mormans life, same with missions
[09/27/2007 02:55:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: have you been on a mission?
[09/27/2007 02:55:51 PM] Julie Anderson: no. Girls can go on a mission if they want to when they're 21, but most don't go.
[09/27/2007 02:56:25 PM] Julie Anderson: There are marriages. Tons. But they're not arranged.
[09/27/2007 02:56:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: mormans are usually big on being with other mormans
[09/27/2007 02:57:03 PM] Julie Anderson: that's true.
[09/27/2007 02:57:53 PM] Julie Anderson: and there's good reason for that.
[09/27/2007 02:57:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: what?
[09/27/2007 02:58:32 PM] Julie Anderson: For one, relationships between a mormon and nonmormon tend to not work out so well.
[09/27/2007 02:59:13 PM] Julie Anderson: And the main reason, we prefer to get married in a mormon temple, and you have to be mormon to get married there.
[09/27/2007 02:59:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: gosh mormans are so strange
[09/27/2007 03:00:12 PM] Julie Anderson: really? hmmm... it's probably true. But I think everyone is strange.
[09/27/2007 03:00:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i have to drive back to the office, brb in like 10
[09/27/2007 03:01:07 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 03:01:10 PM] Julie Anderson: talk to you later then
[09/27/2007 03:01:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope you will still be around, the conversation is very interesting
[09/27/2007 03:01:17 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm at work until 7
[09/27/2007 03:01:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, i work until 5 so i am sure you are terrible bored
[09/27/2007 03:01:44 PM] Julie Anderson: you're keeping me entertained. It's great!
[09/27/2007 03:01:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: alright be back soon
[09/27/2007 03:01:57 PM] Julie Anderson: bye
[09/27/2007 03:02:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh before i go
[09/27/2007 03:02:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you drink at all?
[09/27/2007 03:02:36 PM] Julie Anderson: I drink water and milk and juice...
[09/27/2007 03:02:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you are not allowed to drink anything alcoholic?
[09/27/2007 03:03:06 PM] Julie Anderson: I choose not to drink anything alcoholic.
[09/27/2007 03:03:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: k brb

Session Start (bjcullinan:Julie Anderson): Thu Sep 27 15:17:08 2007
[09/27/2007 03:17:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: so are you 21
[09/27/2007 03:17:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[09/27/2007 03:17:47 PM] Julie Anderson: yes
[09/27/2007 03:17:52 PM] Julie Anderson: But you aren't, are you?
[09/27/2007 03:19:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and you have never had a drink?
[09/27/2007 03:19:26 PM] Julie Anderson: of alcohol? No.
[09/27/2007 03:19:35 PM] Julie Anderson: Do you drink?
[09/27/2007 03:20:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i rather enjoy the taste of beer, i know A LOT about alcohol, how its made, the things that go into beer, a lot about wine and liquors.
[09/27/2007 03:20:43 PM] Julie Anderson: wow
[09/27/2007 03:20:51 PM] Julie Anderson: I definitely don't.
[09/27/2007 03:21:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't drink to the point where i get drunk, i try to avoid that state, but i think that alcohol takes a certain sophistication to understand and enjoy
[09/27/2007 03:21:48 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 03:21:52 PM] Julie Anderson: but you're only 20?
[09/27/2007 03:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think beer is more healthy then soda, and wine can certainly be healthy
[09/27/2007 03:22:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: a glass of wine in the evening helps prevent heart disease.  it seems almost natural since people have been drinking wine long before jesus came around
[09/27/2007 03:23:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, i am only 20
[09/27/2007 03:23:28 PM] Julie Anderson: grapes do the same thing
[09/27/2007 03:23:36 PM] Julie Anderson: which reminds me. I have some in my fridge I need to eat.
[09/27/2007 03:24:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: does it bother you that i learn about alcohol?
[09/27/2007 03:24:08 PM] Julie Anderson: no
[09/27/2007 03:24:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: wine has some advantages over grapes
[09/27/2007 03:25:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: tanin comes from the skins, its very healthy, when just consuming a grape skin, it is hard for the body to digest because of its high fiber
[09/27/2007 03:25:46 PM] Julie Anderson: really? Well, all I know is that one day at work when I was bored, I looked up the benefits of grapes. and they had all the benefits of wine without the side effects from the alcohol.
[09/27/2007 03:26:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: but with aging in barrels that tannin is absorbed by the wine, and it creates an even healthier substance
[09/27/2007 03:26:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: alcohol isn't a bad thing
[09/27/2007 03:27:06 PM] Julie Anderson: interesting
[09/27/2007 03:27:34 PM] Julie Anderson: I still won't drink it. I'm perfectly healthy without it.
[09/27/2007 03:28:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i'm not trying to convince you to do anything
[09/27/2007 03:28:39 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 03:29:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: what kind of music do you listen to?

[09/27/2007 03:34:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats good, 7 to 8 isn't very late

[09/27/2007 05:08:12 PM] Julie Anderson: yes
[09/27/2007 05:08:21 PM] Julie Anderson: good observation!
[09/27/2007 05:21:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i am a CS major, we tend to be very logical
[09/27/2007 05:22:41 PM] Julie Anderson: true
[09/27/2007 05:22:59 PM] Julie Anderson: did you realize we had the same last name?
[09/27/2007 05:24:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: a lot of people have the same last name
[09/27/2007 05:24:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: anderson is a pretty common name
[09/27/2007 05:24:09 PM] Julie Anderson: yeah
[09/27/2007 05:24:15 PM] Julie Anderson: so what clued you in then?
[09/27/2007 05:24:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i realized that you two have some appearance traits in common
[09/27/2007 05:24:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i heard john as morman too
[09/27/2007 05:24:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: and that gave it away
[09/27/2007 05:25:00 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[09/27/2007 05:25:14 PM] Julie Anderson: cause we don't look that much alike, like some siblings do
[09/27/2007 05:25:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you have similar chins
[09/27/2007 05:26:04 PM] Julie Anderson: interesting... I never thought about that.

[09/27/2007 06:41:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: i love food in general
[09/27/2007 06:42:23 PM] Julie Anderson: Well, it seems that the food you will be eating will be better, you just have to wait.

[10/02/2007 08:02:08 PM] Julie Anderson: hi Brian
[10/02/2007 08:02:11 PM] Julie Anderson: got your text
[10/02/2007 08:02:16 PM] Julie Anderson: what are you up to right now?
[10/02/2007 08:02:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: about to watch heroes
[10/02/2007 08:02:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: just chillin
[10/02/2007 08:02:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to get out some homework
[10/02/2007 08:02:52 PM] Julie Anderson: do you still need help with hw?
[10/02/2007 08:03:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: well lets give it another day, i don't think i have a test anytime soon, but i probably will need help because i haven't been doing all the homework
[10/02/2007 08:03:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i was going to go over some old assignments as well as do the homework for tomorrow
[10/02/2007 08:03:57 PM] Julie Anderson: ok
[10/02/2007 08:04:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it is too bad you can't come to my party this weekend
[10/02/2007 08:05:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe my projector will get here before you leave and you come over another night
[10/02/2007 08:05:25 PM] Julie Anderson: I probably wouldn't go anyway if it's a party.
[10/02/2007 08:05:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: well not really a party
[10/02/2007 08:06:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a gathering of friends with similar interests
[10/02/2007 08:06:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: why don't you like parties?
[10/02/2007 08:06:41 PM] Julie Anderson: I love parties.
[10/02/2007 08:07:11 PM] Julie Anderson: But if any alcohol is involved, I likely won't go.
[10/02/2007 08:07:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[10/02/2007 08:07:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats too bad
[10/02/2007 08:08:43 PM] Julie Anderson: but I do love parties. I love being around lots of people.
[10/02/2007 08:08:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: i mean i respect your decision not to drink, but if you try to avoid it all together eventually it will catch up with you
[10/02/2007 08:09:15 PM] Julie Anderson: How will it catch up with me?
[10/02/2007 08:09:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: well a lot of times when you try to avoid something you end up being affected by it more
[10/02/2007 08:11:03 PM] Julie Anderson: Hmmm. I don't quite see how it applies. And I did say likely. I don't want to be around drunk people, or even where everyone is drinking a little. But if it's just a few people drinking, and drinking just a little, I might consider it.
[10/02/2007 08:13:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't allow the actions or drinking habits of other people to affect enjoying the company of my friends, i enjoy being around friends even if they are drunk, if you don't think you could enjoy my company just because other people around me drink then you probably shouldn't come to any of my parties
[10/02/2007 08:14:19 PM] Julie Anderson: yeah probably not
[10/02/2007 08:15:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is too bad, i find you very attractive, i wish we could spend more time together
[10/02/2007 08:15:59 PM] Julie Anderson: hmmm
[10/02/2007 08:16:27 PM] Julie Anderson: Why do you want to spend more time with me?
[10/02/2007 08:17:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think you are interesting, and intelligent, and very pretty
[10/02/2007 08:17:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i like to surround myself with people with those traits
[10/02/2007 08:17:50 PM] Julie Anderson: good. I'm glad there's multiple reasons there.
[10/02/2007 08:18:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, not all my friends are pretty, but intelligent is the important thing
[10/02/2007 08:18:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: you seem skeptical of my intentions
[10/02/2007 08:19:54 PM] Julie Anderson: Well... I could go deep here of my reasons for asking, as there are many. And I'm trying to decide which to say if any.
[10/02/2007 08:20:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: please, don't be afraid to say anything.  i'm a very understanding person.
[10/02/2007 08:21:09 PM] Julie Anderson: Okay. To be vague, I've put a lot of thought into relationships recently. A lot.
[10/02/2007 08:21:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: i put a lot of thought into relationships too.
[10/02/2007 08:22:39 PM] Julie Anderson: So... this is kind of off topic, but if willing, can I ask you a somewhat personal question?
[10/02/2007 08:22:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: of course.
[10/02/2007 08:23:00 PM] Julie Anderson: Do you ever cry?
[10/02/2007 08:23:12 PM] Julie Anderson: random question, I know
[10/02/2007 08:24:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have cried, i can still remember the last time i cried
[10/02/2007 08:24:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: but not frequently
[10/02/2007 08:25:15 PM] Julie Anderson: well, the definition of frequently is different for different people
[10/02/2007 08:25:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you cry?
[10/02/2007 08:26:12 PM] Julie Anderson: I used to cry about once a year.
[10/02/2007 08:26:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: well thats not very much in my opinion
[10/02/2007 08:26:47 PM] Julie Anderson: yeah I don't think so.
[10/02/2007 08:26:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: what makes you cry?
[10/02/2007 08:26:58 PM] Julie Anderson: But this year I cried a bit more than that.
[10/02/2007 08:27:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?
[10/02/2007 08:27:32 PM] Julie Anderson: hmmm, should I answer? I guess.
[10/02/2007 08:28:11 PM] Julie Anderson: I cry when I'm hurt and I don't think it's my fault. This year I cried over a broken relationship.
[10/02/2007 08:28:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have cried over relationships too
[10/02/2007 08:30:06 PM] Julie Anderson: Well, I guess that's our somewhat deep conversation of the day. I'm going home now.
[10/02/2007 08:30:08 PM] Julie Anderson: Bye
[10/02/2007 08:30:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i will look forward to the next one

[10/25/2007 05:54:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: well you're still really amazing

[10/25/2007 05:55:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's just one test, you shouldn't let it get you down
[10/25/2007 05:55:19 PM] Julie Anderson: But I know I'm better than that! These grades make me wonder if stats is really for me...
[10/25/2007 05:55:31 PM] Julie Anderson: well, the last test in this class I got a 55 on (which is a C)
[10/25/2007 05:56:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: well you keep doing better and better, i bet you will get As on the rest of them

[10/25/2007 05:58:50 PM] Julie Anderson: that's why I live next to campus

[10/25/2007 06:01:49 PM] Julie Anderson: cars cost far more money than bikes
[10/25/2007 06:02:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/25/2007 06:03:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i should get a motorcycle
[10/25/2007 06:04:03 PM] Julie Anderson: haha
[10/25/2007 06:04:21 PM] Julie Anderson: that is cheaper than a car I suppose... but image riding it in the snow
[10/25/2007 06:11:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[10/25/2007 06:11:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i'd have to find a girl that likes bikes
[10/25/2007 06:12:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: because otherwise i wouldn't be able to transport 2 people
[10/25/2007 06:13:20 PM] Julie Anderson: haha yeah
[10/25/2007 06:13:33 PM] Julie Anderson: I don't like motorcycles...
[10/25/2007 06:13:38 PM] Julie Anderson: dirt bikes are cool though
[10/25/2007 06:14:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: well if you don't like motorcycles then it's not even an option for me, the idea is just out the window
[10/25/2007 06:14:55 PM] Julie Anderson: too bad
[10/25/2007 06:18:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am kind of sad

[10/25/2007 06:19:45 PM] Julie Anderson: I'm going swimming with a bunch of girls
[10/25/2007 06:20:05 PM] Julie Anderson: I'd invite you, but I don't think they'd want a boy there...
[10/25/2007 06:20:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: a bunch of girls sounds excellent though
[10/25/2007 06:20:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wish i could go
[10/25/2007 06:20:58 PM] Julie Anderson: you could... practice your trumpet

[10/25/2007 06:21:19 PM] Julie Anderson: oh, well that doesn't work very well then
[10/25/2007 06:21:29 PM] Julie Anderson: you could, study
[10/25/2007 06:21:34 PM] Julie Anderson: you could write a song
[10/25/2007 06:21:51 PM] Julie Anderson: you could write an essay for that agassiz contest where you can win $1500
[10/25/2007 06:22:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: writing sucks though
[10/25/2007 06:23:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i could just indulge in my comfort food and watch TV
[10/25/2007 06:23:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that doesn't solve the problem of not having anyone to hang out with tonight
[10/25/2007 06:23:23 PM] Julie Anderson: yeah you could
[10/25/2007 06:23:43 PM] Julie Anderson: I never have that problem. i'm always so busy that I don't have time to hang out with people on weeknights
[10/25/2007 06:23:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could rewrite this calendar script i made

[03/07/2008 02:35:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: or scheme because it is multi-paradigmal, and it will do things in the order you tell it
[03/07/2008 02:35:16 AM] Julie Anderson: i haven't even heard of those
[03/07/2008 02:35:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: i do like C though

[04/28/2008 10:21:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: but then the thing that made my weekend ok, well it ended, so now it is back to being bad
[04/28/2008 10:21:40 PM] Julie Anderson: what made your weekend ok?
[04/28/2008 10:22:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: being with crystal
[04/28/2008 10:22:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is something about you math majors
[04/28/2008 10:22:39 PM] Julie Anderson: :D
[04/28/2008 10:22:46 PM] Julie Anderson: she has a wonderful bf you know..
[04/28/2008 10:22:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i disagree
[04/28/2008 10:23:16 PM] Julie Anderson: that's what she told me anyway
[04/28/2008 10:23:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: when?
[04/28/2008 10:23:50 PM] Julie Anderson: I don't remember. that one night I was talking to you, and I was talking to her, and you were tlaking  to her
[04/28/2008 10:27:10 PM] Julie Anderson: so why don't you think her bf is wonderful?
[04/28/2008 10:27:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just think he is possessive and obsessed.
[04/28/2008 10:31:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is not a good way to build a strong relationship
[04/28/2008 10:32:01 PM] Julie Anderson: hmm ok
[04/28/2008 10:32:09 PM] Julie Anderson: well, she's going to new york
[04/28/2008 10:32:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: IMHO of course
[04/28/2008 10:32:25 PM] Julie Anderson: IMHO?
[04/28/2008 10:32:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't understand the relevance
[04/28/2008 10:32:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[04/28/2008 10:32:39 PM] Julie Anderson: what does that mean
[04/28/2008 10:32:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: but that is good for her
[04/28/2008 10:32:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: in my honest opinion
[04/28/2008 10:33:29 PM] Julie Anderson: oh
[04/28/2008 10:33:59 PM] Julie Anderson: well---he didn't talk her out of it, though I know he didn't want her to go that far away
[04/28/2008 10:38:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i absolutely would never ask a significant other to give up their aspirations to be with me
[04/28/2008 10:39:13 PM] Julie Anderson: that's very selfless of you
[04/28/2008 10:40:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: not that i would not want to be with them, i certainly would, but when you have a goal in life you should pursue it no matter where it takes you.  and in this case, she will eventually come back, but i think she should be free of any relationship during that time, to really determine what she wants in life and relationships
[04/28/2008 10:41:54 PM] Julie Anderson: that makes sense
[04/28/2008 10:41:56 PM] Julie Anderson: I like that
[04/28/2008 10:42:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am glad
[04/28/2008 10:42:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just a reasonable guy
