[07/29/2008 10:47:07 PM] Travis Hudson: Anyway, the whole thing was all in fun, for some good laughs. I didn't really pay any attention to the nasty politics of who was there or where it was. I was just trying to have fun and be a little less self conscious for once.
[07/29/2008 10:47:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha

[07/30/2008 02:27:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: when you get off work could you print out a banner that says like "We Will Miss You Joe" and bring it to the party tonight
[07/30/2008 02:27:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have a printer
[07/30/2008 02:27:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: :-(
[07/30/2008 02:28:03 PM] Travis Hudson: I'll be busy right up until I go to the party.
[07/30/2008 02:28:15 PM] Travis Hudson: My printer is buried.
[07/30/2008 02:28:21 PM] Travis Hudson: It would take a while to get it working again.
[07/30/2008 02:28:37 PM] Travis Hudson: You can always draw it out with crayon, right?

[07/30/2008 02:29:03 PM] Travis Hudson: Perhaps a sharpie.
[07/30/2008 02:29:17 PM] Travis Hudson: The work printer is for work purposes.
[07/30/2008 02:29:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm

[07/30/2008 02:29:40 PM] Travis Hudson: To make it look really cool.
[07/30/2008 02:30:13 PM] Travis Hudson: Sarah, the woman who sits next to me at work, has a yellow and blue marker, that I can see from just glancing over there.
[07/30/2008 02:30:25 PM] Travis Hudson: She can also draw way better than I can.
[07/30/2008 02:30:34 PM] Travis Hudson: Dare we enlist her help?

[08/03/2008 02:50:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/03/2008 02:58:23 PM] Travis Hudson: Did we postpone it because Dave has work, or is it more of a tiredness thing?
[08/03/2008 02:59:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is potentially tedious
[08/03/2008 02:59:30 PM] Travis Hudson: Well, yeah. That's why we should get it over with as soon as possible! :)
[08/03/2008 03:00:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: and because dave has work

[08/03/2008 03:02:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: sedona for shopping?
[08/03/2008 03:02:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: that doesn't not appeal to me
[08/03/2008 03:02:23 PM] Travis Hudson: Not for shopping.
[08/03/2008 03:02:36 PM] Travis Hudson: Just adventuring. Trying to stir up some trouble.
[08/03/2008 03:02:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: we are going to vegas, why would you want to go to sedona?
[08/03/2008 03:03:04 PM] Travis Hudson: Because I'm really super bored right now.
[08/03/2008 03:03:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: find something to do

[08/03/2008 03:05:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: that would be nice
[08/03/2008 03:05:59 PM] Travis Hudson: And if not, then at least the change of scenery would be nice.

[09/15/2008 11:00:01 AM] Travis Hudson: Okay, so I was walking along, and I had to move past a sign.
[09/15/2008 11:00:45 AM] Travis Hudson: I wanted to go under the large blue NAU sign, but I didn't duck far enough and I slammed into it at walking speed.
[09/15/2008 11:01:30 AM] Travis Hudson: It wasn't entirely my fault -- I was being pulled by someone who was holding my hand.

[09/15/2008 11:06:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: by my standards?
[09/15/2008 11:07:05 AM] Travis Hudson: Eh. She's cute. I found out that we really don't connect as far as personalities and ideas are concerned.
[09/15/2008 11:07:18 AM] Travis Hudson: So I'm going to have to let her go.
[09/15/2008 11:07:48 AM] Travis Hudson: It's a damn shame, too. I really want a girlfriend, but I'm not going to force something to work when I know it's wrong.
[09/15/2008 11:08:08 AM] Travis Hudson: That reminds me, Mel never told me why she's so mad.

[09/26/2008 12:56:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe i want a list of comics so i can print them out and use them as toilet paper
[09/26/2008 12:56:16 PM] Travis Hudson: It seemed like a fairly random question. I was curious.
[09/26/2008 12:56:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: it most definitely wouldn't be because i want something to read and laugh at

[10/09/2008 11:50:51 AM] Travis Hudson: Why not just use the ACM printer instead?
[10/09/2008 11:51:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: because you aren't in the acm room
[10/09/2008 11:52:11 AM] Travis Hudson: You want to fax it to me.

[10/09/2008 12:10:43 PM] Travis Hudson: Ah, yes. Here it is.
[10/09/2008 12:13:53 PM] Travis Hudson: I'm making a change.
[10/09/2008 12:13:57 PM] Travis Hudson: I have a sweet idea...
[10/09/2008 12:17:02 PM] Travis Hudson: I've made the change.
[10/09/2008 12:17:43 PM] Travis Hudson: Let's work together on this project. I just thought of something:
[10/09/2008 12:18:20 PM] Travis Hudson: For this particular web application, it would be very useful to have a section of the website that is an iPhone/iPod Touch web app.
[10/09/2008 12:18:58 PM] Travis Hudson: That way, Matt or Leah could make updates very easily right from their phones.
[10/09/2008 12:19:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: agreed!
[10/09/2008 12:19:23 PM] Travis Hudson: A web app is really just a specially designed web page with extra large buttons, etc. Shouldn't be too tough.
[10/09/2008 12:19:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i believe ext js is iphone compatible, it will be just as pretty but smaller!
[10/09/2008 12:19:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to make the buttons resize depending on the size of the display
[10/09/2008 12:20:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: then wrap around to the next line if they don't fit
[10/09/2008 12:20:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so they will have a minimum size
[10/09/2008 12:20:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: we also need an item search, which will be in part on your end, so we can just enter a code and it will only show the matching buttons
[10/09/2008 12:21:28 PM] Travis Hudson: We should do an interface sketch at the meeting.
[10/09/2008 12:21:52 PM] Travis Hudson: Perhaps make it an agenda item, see what everyone thinks.
[10/09/2008 12:23:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure but make sure all the stuff under interface design is included
[10/09/2008 12:23:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: and don't be afraid of multiple dialogs
[10/09/2008 12:23:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: i won't be there so you will have to direct
[10/09/2008 12:23:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: also add it to the whiteboard when you get there
[10/09/2008 12:24:02 PM] Travis Hudson: Why won't you be there?
[10/09/2008 12:25:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'll be in phoenix
[10/09/2008 12:25:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am sure you can handle it
[10/09/2008 12:26:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: ALSO
[10/09/2008 12:26:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: talk to murphy about implementing the barcode reader
[10/09/2008 12:26:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is an essential part
