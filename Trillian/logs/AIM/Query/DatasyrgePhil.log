[11/06/2007 05:23:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: it wasn't working any better
[11/06/2007 05:24:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: perl for what?

[11/06/2007 05:26:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: pick one from monstertemplates.com
[11/06/2007 05:26:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://www.templatemonster.com/)http://www.templatemonster.com/
[11/06/2007 05:27:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: those are mostly xhtml compliant and so easy to implement
[11/06/2007 05:27:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: wouldn't even have to change the backend for the site at all
[11/06/2007 05:28:03 PM] Phillip Schafer: Why do we need to buy a template, I don't like that idea.. :p.. Actually, I think I have some of their templates hacked...
[11/06/2007 05:28:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: they are prettier colors
[11/06/2007 05:29:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: but thats besides the point
[11/06/2007 05:29:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't know much perl
[11/06/2007 05:29:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and perl kind of sucks
[11/06/2007 05:30:14 PM] Phillip Schafer: Um, so you want us to buy a template?  Is that what your last company did?
[11/06/2007 05:30:35 PM] Phillip Schafer: Do you want the work? We can talk about it more next week when I meet with you to tell you what I need done.
[11/06/2007 05:30:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: my company bought templates for their clients yes, we also had them designed by the same type of people that make those ones
[11/06/2007 05:31:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'd love to hear your business plan, and advice is always free
[11/06/2007 05:31:14 PM] Phillip Schafer: We are on a farely tight time schedule, so how does your schedule look?
[11/06/2007 05:32:14 PM] Phillip Schafer: I got another business major that really wants the work, I would prefer to go through you, you know his business and you built his site, so I think you have more of a background
[11/06/2007 05:32:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: my company had a graphics designer lay out an example page, then we had a completely separate guy convert the picture (psd) file into html and css, then i always wrote the backends and did some template modifying
[11/06/2007 05:32:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am available tomorrow between 5 and 6:45
[11/06/2007 05:32:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i will be on campus the whole time

[11/06/2007 05:33:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: does this other guy know php?
[11/06/2007 05:33:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i commented the code pretty well, he certainly doesn't have to rewrite all of it if he knows perl
[11/06/2007 05:34:31 PM] Phillip Schafer: ok, sweet, I actually want to meet next week
[11/06/2007 05:35:04 PM] Phillip Schafer: I got a pretty packed schedule right now
