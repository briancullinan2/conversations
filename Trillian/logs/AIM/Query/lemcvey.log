[08/09/2007 08:50:10 PM] LEMcVey: yea, you hadn't seen it before?
[08/09/2007 08:50:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: nope
[08/09/2007 08:50:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i bought a mount for my monitor
[08/09/2007 08:50:28 PM] LEMcVey: yea?
[08/09/2007 08:50:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: similar to a wall mount but attaches to the desk
[08/09/2007 08:50:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: it looks really nice
[08/09/2007 08:50:47 PM] LEMcVey: good
[08/09/2007 08:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wanted to try one, maybe i'll get 2more someday and mount ll my monitors
[08/09/2007 08:51:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i will have room for 3 more monitors underneath the mounted ones
[08/09/2007 08:51:33 PM] LEMcVey: did you use a molly screw?
[08/09/2007 08:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: mollyskrew?
[08/09/2007 08:51:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: like where it screws in underneathe?
[08/09/2007 08:51:59 PM] LEMcVey: how did you mount it?  How do you know it went into wood/
[08/09/2007 08:52:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: no its one of those things that has the screw underneath and just attaches to the desk
[08/09/2007 08:52:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: not actually skrewing it into the wall or desk, it just clamps onto it
[08/09/2007 08:52:57 PM] LEMcVey: I see
[08/09/2007 08:53:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it supports up to 25 pound monitors, and mine is only 20, very impressive
[08/09/2007 08:53:11 PM] LEMcVey: cool
[08/09/2007 08:53:17 PM] LEMcVey: i gotta go...

[09/25/2007 08:58:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already dropped the class
[09/25/2007 08:58:31 PM] LEMcVey: it will affect insurance, car, health everything if you are not fulltime
[09/25/2007 08:58:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: really?
[09/25/2007 08:58:42 PM] LEMcVey: really
[09/25/2007 08:58:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: how does it affect all those things?
[09/25/2007 08:59:05 PM] LEMcVey: you can't be part of dad's policy if you are not a full time student over the age of 18
[09/25/2007 08:59:29 PM] LEMcVey: you need to go see a counselor
[09/25/2007 08:59:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess so
[09/25/2007 08:59:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: how does it affect car insurance?
[09/25/2007 09:00:06 PM] LEMcVey: car, I am not sure, but I think because you are considered an adult unless you are going to school full time
[09/25/2007 09:00:23 PM] LEMcVey: even for tax dependency purposes you have to be full time
[09/25/2007 09:00:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i don't think i can undrop a class
[09/25/2007 09:00:41 PM] LEMcVey: no but maybe something else can happen
[09/25/2007 09:00:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and there is no reason for me to keep it when its obvious i will fail again
[09/25/2007 09:01:06 PM] LEMcVey: not unless you get help of some kind
[09/25/2007 09:02:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think that will help, the class median was an 85
[09/25/2007 09:02:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: and i got a 67
[09/25/2007 09:05:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just don't want to fail another class
[09/25/2007 09:06:08 PM] LEMcVey: I understand
[09/25/2007 09:06:17 PM] LEMcVey: I just don't want you to jeopardize anything else
[09/25/2007 09:06:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: and most classes have already had homework assignments and quizzes and tests even, so if i added another class it would be difficult or impossible to make up that work
[09/25/2007 09:06:52 PM] LEMcVey: that is why you need to talk to a counselor, maybe something online
[09/25/2007 09:15:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: is there a chance that insurance won't find out about any of this stuff until next semester?
[09/25/2007 09:16:43 PM] LEMcVey: i don't know sweetie, just talk to someone and find out if you have any options, l love you

[04/16/2008 09:39:07 AM] LEMcVey: it flips me out when you say things like that
[04/16/2008 09:39:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am worried the skin problem i have been having could be my oral herpes spreading to other places
[04/16/2008 09:39:28 AM] LEMcVey: did you do any research on the internet
[04/16/2008 09:39:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did
[04/16/2008 09:39:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: there is nothing conclusive
[04/16/2008 09:39:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it doesn't look nearly as aggressive
[04/16/2008 09:40:09 AM] LEMcVey: if you are worried you need to go see a doctor
[04/16/2008 09:40:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: but the sores are looking more and more blister like
[04/16/2008 09:40:18 AM] LEMcVey: did you even tell dr segal about your herpes
[04/16/2008 09:40:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe
[04/16/2008 09:43:16 AM] LEMcVey: (Link: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/)http://www.nlm.nih.gov/(Link: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001324.htm)medlineplus/ency/article/001324.h(Link: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001324.htm)(Link: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001324.htm)tm
[04/16/2008 09:45:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think the blisters would look the same as the mouth ones if that is what it is
[04/16/2008 09:45:22 AM] LEMcVey: I think you probably have highly sensitive skin
[04/16/2008 09:45:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: but since they are really mild and don't look to be filled with fluid like the mouth ones are, i don't think it is the same thing
[04/16/2008 09:45:31 AM] LEMcVey: i have been in my itching mode for about two weeks
[04/16/2008 09:45:46 AM] LEMcVey: if you have allergies you have to go to a doctor
[04/16/2008 09:45:57 AM] LEMcVey: and keep getting shots or whatever they suggest
[04/16/2008 09:48:28 AM] LEMcVey: i am working on something in the back of the house so I won't hear this ...talk later

[04/28/2008 09:06:39 AM] LEMcVey: measure the dimentions of the closet so we can see if a separate washer dryer will fit
