[09/03/2007 06:18:10 PM] Andrea Kohn: I need to access a website through the NAU VPN thing
[09/03/2007 06:18:14 PM] Andrea Kohn: I set up the connection and everything
[09/03/2007 06:18:20 PM] Andrea Kohn: and I'm connected
[09/03/2007 06:18:32 PM] Andrea Kohn: but how to I get to the page I'm looking for?
[09/03/2007 06:18:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: you type it in the address bar in internet explorer
[09/03/2007 06:18:56 PM] Andrea Kohn: ok
[09/03/2007 06:18:59 PM] Andrea Kohn: I'll try that again
[09/03/2007 06:19:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you call resnet
[09/03/2007 06:19:24 PM] Andrea Kohn: what if I don't have Internet explorer?
[09/03/2007 06:19:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't live on campus so i never deal with their shitty internet service
[09/03/2007 06:19:37 PM] Andrea Kohn: haha
[09/03/2007 06:19:40 PM] Andrea Kohn: I don't live on campus either
[09/03/2007 06:19:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: then use firefox
[09/03/2007 06:19:49 PM] Andrea Kohn: when I do that
[09/03/2007 06:19:58 PM] Andrea Kohn: it adds the whole (Link: http://www)http://www. thing in front of it
[09/03/2007 06:20:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i guarantee you have internet explorer
[09/03/2007 06:20:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok
[09/03/2007 06:20:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you are not on campus you should be using the nau vpn
[09/03/2007 06:20:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: *shouldn't
[09/03/2007 06:20:43 PM] Andrea Kohn: so if it's a VPN website I can't access it off campus?
[09/03/2007 06:21:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: vpn is a way of accessing the internet, not a type of internet
[09/03/2007 06:21:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is no such thing as a vpn website
[09/03/2007 06:21:27 PM] Andrea Kohn: ok

[09/03/2007 06:22:03 PM] Andrea Kohn: and the Nursing instructors are like VPN blah blah blah
[09/03/2007 06:22:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah well they fucked up because that isn't an internet address and can't be accessed no matter what vpn you are connected to
[09/03/2007 06:23:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: that looks like an internal network address which means you can only access it from building you have the class in
[09/03/2007 06:23:36 PM] Andrea Kohn: ah...
[09/03/2007 06:23:36 PM] Andrea Kohn: ok
