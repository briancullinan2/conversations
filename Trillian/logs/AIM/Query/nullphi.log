[12/29/2008 09:39:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think it would be possible to cut up a bunch of wires and reconnect them to a bundle of wires? and how do i order the bundle of wires?  what is is called when there are a bunch of different colors in 1 case of wireing?

[12/29/2008 09:47:15 PM] John Meyer: i think you'd rather have unshielded for accessories and such, but i dont know where to get that
[12/29/2008 09:48:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i really want something that will wind up my extra wire
[12/29/2008 09:53:32 PM] John Meyer: maybe look for an aes/ebu snake cable... although im not sure of the bandwidth of any of it for usb or whatever

[01/10/2009 03:34:09 PM] John Meyer: it will fail out if it cant repair it
[01/10/2009 03:34:16 PM] John Meyer: refresh the page, check the download speed
[01/10/2009 03:34:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: there are plenty of par2 files
[01/10/2009 03:34:26 PM] John Meyer: look at the files tab and see what is being downloaded

[01/10/2009 03:49:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: he said we shouldn't tell anyone about it because it is going to become popular and then it will get shut down
[01/10/2009 03:53:16 PM] John Meyer: heh
[01/10/2009 03:53:44 PM] John Meyer: the default install only accepts connections from the local machine, i believe
[01/10/2009 03:54:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you mean?
[01/10/2009 03:54:27 PM] John Meyer: "he said we shouldn't tell anyone about it because it is going to become popular and then it will get shut down"

[01/10/2009 03:54:47 PM] John Meyer: the application itself
[01/10/2009 03:54:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: no i mean it does everything and it is so useful
[01/10/2009 03:55:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: and if usenets become too popular it will get shut down
[01/10/2009 03:55:08 PM] John Meyer: it makes newsgroups a lot more userfriendly
[01/10/2009 03:55:09 PM] John Meyer: yeah
[01/10/2009 03:55:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: it takes so long to verify
[01/10/2009 03:55:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: ugh!
[01/10/2009 03:55:34 PM] John Meyer: running it on a slow machine?
[01/10/2009 03:55:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's a dual core
[01/10/2009 03:55:54 PM] John Meyer: hrm
[01/10/2009 03:56:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: it is going across the network though
[01/10/2009 03:56:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[01/10/2009 03:56:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: that could be it
[01/10/2009 03:56:16 PM] John Meyer: oh... theres the problem.
[01/10/2009 03:56:37 PM] John Meyer: i really need to get some stuff wired in my house... or get just draftn
[01/10/2009 03:59:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am thinking maybe i should move the entire program to my webserver
[01/10/2009 03:59:39 PM] Brian Cullinan: *fileserver
[01/10/2009 03:59:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: instead of my webserver
[01/10/2009 04:00:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: to make all the file locations local, because right now the two are networked and i think that is where the bottleneck is
[01/10/2009 04:01:28 PM] John Meyer: i would agree, unless there is a wired interlink it will be the bottleneck
[01/10/2009 04:05:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: my fileserver isn't supported anymore
[01/10/2009 04:05:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so this might not work
[01/10/2009 04:05:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: suck
[01/10/2009 04:06:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: failed to fetch a ton of shit

[01/11/2009 04:03:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have been having some problems with sabnzbd
[01/11/2009 04:03:26 PM] John Meyer: what?
[01/11/2009 04:03:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when it shuts down i don't think it comes back up properly
[01/11/2009 04:04:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: for example, i just it down when it was almost done with a download, and it said it completely successfully but it only moved the last rar file it was working on in to the completed directory
[01/11/2009 04:04:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: so all the other files it download disappeared
[01/11/2009 04:05:00 PM] John Meyer: i have never shut it down
[01/11/2009 04:05:11 PM] John Meyer: except when i do a restart or somesuch
[01/11/2009 04:06:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok, it was running great for a while but some time during the night one of the files got hung up on the repair, unpacking, there was no status or anything, and it caused all of the other files downloaded after that to disappear
[01/11/2009 04:06:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: there were like 100 things that were completely gone
[01/11/2009 04:07:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: not in the incomplete folder or anything
[01/11/2009 04:07:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: when i restarted it moved all the folders to _Failed<name> and they were all empty
[01/11/2009 04:07:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: but it just had the little working circle indicator
[01/11/2009 04:07:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: nothing else
[01/11/2009 04:08:13 PM] John Meyer: weird... i have had it fail on some downloads, process large downloads, etc... never any missing files.
[01/11/2009 04:08:20 PM] John Meyer: try the irc / forums?
[01/11/2009 04:08:32 PM] John Meyer: my buddy on osx has also had no problems
[01/11/2009 04:08:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's like because 1 got hung up it never moved any downloads over from cache
[01/11/2009 04:09:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i am hoping it is because i have been messing with which user is running the python script, so i am thinking the cache folder was owned by root
[01/11/2009 04:09:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it was writable, but couldn't move files
[01/11/2009 04:10:12 PM] John Meyer: it should be smarter than that though... hopefully not and it is just permission issues
[01/11/2009 04:10:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am going to run the script as root for a while and see if that works
[01/11/2009 04:18:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: does python do garbage collection?

[05/03/2009 01:16:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: we need to get those speakers hung in the broadcast studio, the digital phones hooked up, and the new recording switcher board hooked up
[05/03/2009 01:16:50 PM] John Meyer: we should take down the speakers in the prod studio
[05/03/2009 01:17:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: why?

[05/03/2009 01:19:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: we couldn't screw them all the way in, the last little bit was a bitch, i think we need to use a power tool to have that momentum to get that last little bit, but they seemed pretty solid to me
