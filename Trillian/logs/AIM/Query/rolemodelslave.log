[04/21/2008 10:42:52 PM] Megan Ekstrom: i'm alive which is better than i thought i would be at this point
[04/21/2008 10:43:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: what happened?
[04/21/2008 10:43:32 PM] Megan Ekstrom: i didn't make twirler at asu
[04/21/2008 10:43:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[04/21/2008 10:44:00 PM] Megan Ekstrom: yea
[04/21/2008 10:44:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you were disappointed in yourself?
[04/21/2008 10:44:15 PM] Megan Ekstrom: pretty much
[04/21/2008 10:44:22 PM] Megan Ekstrom: and completely falling apart
[04/21/2008 10:44:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: is this your last year?
[04/21/2008 10:44:43 PM] Megan Ekstrom: yep
[04/21/2008 10:45:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, maybe this will give you time to focus on graduating, and starting a career.
[04/21/2008 10:45:36 PM] Megan Ekstrom: that's one option
[04/21/2008 10:45:40 PM] Megan Ekstrom: but not the one i wanted
[04/21/2008 10:45:50 PM] Megan Ekstrom: cause i miss out on having a little brother in my fraternity
[04/21/2008 10:45:56 PM] Megan Ekstrom: and my last semester on the field
[04/21/2008 10:46:01 PM] Megan Ekstrom: and time with all my friends
[04/21/2008 10:46:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, i still think you are amazing
[04/21/2008 10:46:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sure everything will work out
[04/21/2008 10:47:00 PM] Megan Ekstrom: i hope so, but it's hard to see the bright side of it
[04/21/2008 10:48:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: well you don't necessarily need a field to perform, and if your friends are truly your friends you will find ways to spend time together
[04/21/2008 10:49:08 PM] Megan Ekstrom: i know it's just...it's gonna hurt so bad
[04/21/2008 10:49:19 PM] Megan Ekstrom: it never meant this much to me before
[04/21/2008 10:49:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: anything i can do to help?
[04/21/2008 10:50:08 PM] Megan Ekstrom: unless you're up to assassinating some dumb ass twirlers over here, not really
[04/21/2008 10:50:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, are they underaged?
[04/21/2008 10:50:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: do they have a high enough standing gpa to be on the team?
[04/21/2008 10:50:50 PM] Megan Ekstrom: um, one isn't
[04/21/2008 10:51:00 PM] Megan Ekstrom: that's not required of us
[04/21/2008 10:53:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[04/21/2008 10:53:57 PM] Megan Ekstrom: i dunno, i think i'll figure something out
[04/21/2008 10:54:02 PM] Megan Ekstrom: it'll just take awhile
[04/21/2008 10:54:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: might you be a stand in for one of the other twirlers?
[04/21/2008 10:55:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: then might they happen to get super drunk and throw up at like the last game?
[04/21/2008 10:55:24 PM] Megan Ekstrom: yea i doubt that 
[04/21/2008 10:55:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: well, just something to think about
[04/21/2008 10:57:22 PM] Megan Ekstrom: we'll just see what happens, cause i know one of them doesn't want the spot, wants to go somewhere closer to home
[04/21/2008 10:57:31 PM] Megan Ekstrom: so i think her trying out was complete bullshit
[04/21/2008 11:00:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
