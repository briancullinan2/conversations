[05/27/2007 11:49:09 PM] Robert Douglas:  because i really dont want you to have a phone(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:49:16 PM] Robert Douglas:  since u never call back(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:49:21 PM] Robert Douglas:  especially when i called twice(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:49:34 PM] BJCullinan: i don't get good reception at home
[05/27/2007 11:49:42 PM] Robert Douglas:  but the call still went through(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:49:45 PM] BJCullinan: and i was probably spending time with my family
[05/27/2007 11:50:02 PM] Robert Douglas:  even with bad reception, it's still better to call back(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:50:08 PM] Robert Douglas:  or call using your parent's line or something(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:50:13 PM] BJCullinan: so i told you i needed the weekend off for that purpose and you are just going to have to deal with it
[05/27/2007 11:50:18 PM] Robert Douglas:  either way, i really wish i could get a hold of you better(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:50:31 PM] Robert Douglas:  i'm not talking just about the weekend, i'm talking about all the time(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:50:46 PM] BJCullinan: and i am definitely not getting paid enough to listen to you bitch about it 3 times a week to me
[05/27/2007 11:50:53 PM] Robert Douglas:  and you never said you werent going ot be available via the phone(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:51:02 PM] BJCullinan: you can always leave message here, i will ALWAYS get the IMs
[05/27/2007 11:51:09 PM] Robert Douglas:  i thought u wanted to be a partner?(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:51:27 PM] BJCullinan: there are a lot of great things i want for this company
[05/27/2007 11:51:36 PM] Robert Douglas:  alex and myself don't get paid for a lot of things(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:51:43 PM] BJCullinan: and there are a lot of things that i think need to be worked on and get completely ignored
[05/27/2007 11:51:46 PM] Robert Douglas:  but since we are partners and owners of the company, we dont care(Link: http://www.codepaster.com/code.php?code=4679)
[05/27/2007 11:52:11 PM] BJCullinan: yeah except i am always being a coding monkey so that we don't need to rely on someone else
[05/27/2007 11:52:26 PM] BJCullinan: and for that i should be paid for, and can't even get paid on time
[05/27/2007 11:52:34 PM] BJCullinan: and i have recommended changes that were ignore
[05/27/2007 11:52:47 PM] BJCullinan: so from now on i am talking to the BM about it
[05/27/2007 11:53:13 PM] BJCullinan: and if you need to be informed on what goes on between us you can ask alex
[05/27/2007 11:53:26 PM] BJCullinan: i don't like the way our meetings are handled for example
[05/27/2007 11:53:30 PM] Robert Douglas:  this attitude wont get you far
[05/27/2007 11:53:34 PM] Robert Douglas:  with the company
[05/27/2007 11:53:36 PM] Robert Douglas:  just keep that in mind
[05/27/2007 11:53:42 PM] Robert Douglas:  alex feels the same way about it
[05/27/2007 11:53:47 PM] BJCullinan: we don't cover enough information and half the time we spend arguing about what should happen
[05/27/2007 11:54:02 PM] Robert Douglas:  we might argue a lot, but we end up with a much better resolution in the end
[05/27/2007 11:54:10 PM] BJCullinan: i am not giving you attitude, i am simply speaking my mind
[05/27/2007 11:54:30 PM] Robert Douglas:  i'm just letting u know that if you plan to go far with the company, you need to change
[05/27/2007 11:54:51 PM] Robert Douglas:  attitude like "and if you need to be informed on what goes on between us you can ask alex" isn't going to get you anywhere
[05/27/2007 11:55:06 PM] BJCullinan: i believe i am completely just in that statement
[05/27/2007 11:55:14 PM] BJCullinan: no, there should be no arguing, that is whats wrong with having a partnership is both of you have different views and both of you have the same authority
[05/27/2007 11:55:16 PM] Robert Douglas:  alex is more of a business man than me, u actually think he wants someone that thinks like that?
[05/27/2007 11:55:51 PM] BJCullinan: now you are trying to argue with me about appropriate attitude, i don't know why i bother trying to reason with you
[05/27/2007 11:56:21 PM] BJCullinan: i am done, i am having a meeting between alex and i sometime this week and we will cover some of these "attitude" problems
[05/27/2007 11:56:48 PM] Robert Douglas:  ok, hopefully things will work out
[05/27/2007 11:59:40 PM] BJCullinan: i want to be a bigger part of this company and i don't feel my skills are being completely taken advantage of, i know it is hard just starting out and still working out the problems, but i don't think we are moving fast enough, or as fast as we could be
[05/28/2007 12:00:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  well, i wouldnt worry too much, because the attitudfe u have, u wont get far
[05/28/2007 12:00:52 AM] Robert Douglas:  saying you wont talk to someone who owns the company, is pretty serious
[05/28/2007 12:01:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  and you wont be part of the company if you cant deal with alex or myself
[05/28/2007 12:01:24 AM] BJCullinan: yeah and making up reasons why i should handle certain projects is pretty seriously and frankly kind of insulting
[05/28/2007 12:01:27 AM] Robert Douglas:  but i think you have potential to go far, so i play it cool
[05/28/2007 12:01:27 AM] BJCullinan: ok thanks for your opinion, i hope alex agrees and we can resolve this conflict
[05/28/2007 12:01:57 AM] BJCullinan: i try to let go all the time you made smart ass comments like "thats why we don't let you run the servers"
[05/28/2007 12:02:02 AM] BJCullinan: pretty fucking insulting
[05/28/2007 12:02:08 AM] Robert Douglas:  u dont know our servers
[05/28/2007 12:02:25 AM] Robert Douglas:  you expect us to trust you with our clients without knowing OUR specific setup?
[05/28/2007 12:02:29 AM] Robert Douglas:  you dont have experience with it
[05/28/2007 12:02:52 AM] Robert Douglas:  if you did,it would be completely different, but our admins have years experience with everything on our servers
[05/28/2007 12:03:08 AM] Robert Douglas:  they know about specific conflicts with certain programs
[05/28/2007 12:03:17 AM] Robert Douglas:  they know every piece of software inside and out
[05/28/2007 12:03:29 AM] Robert Douglas:  one of our admins actually works for cpanel.net
[05/28/2007 12:03:53 AM] BJCullinan: thats fine, i don't expect to take over, and don't want the responsibility, but you act like you are the only one that is allowed administer anything that happens on them
[05/28/2007 12:04:04 AM] Robert Douglas:  i'm not an admin
[05/28/2007 12:04:08 AM] Robert Douglas:  and never have i said i was
[05/28/2007 12:04:26 AM] BJCullinan: but you are the only one that contacts them, everything that happens has to go through you
[05/28/2007 12:04:30 AM] Robert Douglas:  we PAY to have admins
[05/28/2007 12:04:36 AM] Robert Douglas:  no, alex can contact them
[05/28/2007 12:05:02 AM] BJCullinan: well, i have a need to contact them more often then he does, why don't i have that information?
[05/28/2007 12:05:50 AM] Robert Douglas:  because we never talked about it
[05/28/2007 12:06:04 AM] BJCullinan: but that was just an example of something that i felt insulted by and i let go
[05/28/2007 12:06:42 AM] BJCullinan: now alex is the business manager, there are things that i need to talk to him about and if they lead back to discussing them with you then i most certainly will
[05/28/2007 12:06:45 AM] Robert Douglas:  tell that to any professional hosting company, and they will laugh at you
[05/28/2007 12:07:01 AM] Robert Douglas:  about the lack of being full admin
[05/28/2007 12:07:05 AM] BJCullinan: no
[05/28/2007 12:07:12 AM] BJCullinan: that was an example of something i let go
[05/28/2007 12:07:18 AM] BJCullinan: i need to talk to alex about contracts
[05/28/2007 12:07:20 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, you should hav elet it go
[05/28/2007 12:07:48 AM] BJCullinan: so there are things you will have to let go, such as me needed to talk to alex and you asking him about what we discussed
[05/28/2007 12:07:53 AM] Robert Douglas:  because you need to understand that you cant admin a server without LOTS of experience
[05/28/2007 12:08:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex and i share everytthing
[05/28/2007 12:08:15 AM] BJCullinan: well good, then there won't be anyone left out of the loop
[05/28/2007 12:08:36 AM] Robert Douglas:  yup, since we are partners we always share
[05/28/2007 12:08:41 AM] BJCullinan: but i can make quicker progress with him, then having you interject every other message in a chat
[05/28/2007 12:09:00 AM] Robert Douglas:  you wont get far, because it is easy to convince alex since he doesn't have the technical knowledge i have
[05/28/2007 12:09:17 AM] Robert Douglas:  and once you convince him,he has to convince me, and i'll ask him questions he won't be able to answer, or he will need you to answer
[05/28/2007 12:09:18 AM] BJCullinan: and that will be one of the topics we talk about, finding a better form of communication
[05/28/2007 12:09:36 AM] Robert Douglas:  anything technology related will go through me, and then i bring it to alex
[05/28/2007 12:09:44 AM] Robert Douglas:  anything business related goes through alex, and then he brings it to me
[05/28/2007 12:09:50 AM] BJCullinan: i am going to talk to alex simply because he is BM, and the subjects of our discussion will be related to things he administer
[05/28/2007 12:09:52 AM] Robert Douglas:  like the new BM role, he brought it to me
[05/28/2007 12:10:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, that's fine
[05/28/2007 12:10:05 AM] Robert Douglas:  you can talk to either one of us
[05/28/2007 12:10:24 AM] Robert Douglas:  just keep in mind it is much easier to get a result about technology if you talk to me first, and it is easier to get a result about business if you talk to alex first
[05/28/2007 12:10:26 AM] BJCullinan: ok, and i am choosing to talk to the BM
[05/28/2007 12:10:33 AM] Robert Douglas:  but both of us know a decent amount of info on both sides
[05/28/2007 12:10:37 AM] BJCullinan: ok
[05/28/2007 12:11:09 AM] Robert Douglas:  that's fine, anything technolgoy related though, will get run by me, and if alex isnt able to answer all questions, then he'll go back to you
[05/28/2007 12:11:11 AM] BJCullinan: so don't be offended when i choose to talk to him, and you have to go and ask him what we talked about
[05/28/2007 12:11:20 AM] Robert Douglas:  i wont ask him
[05/28/2007 12:11:23 AM] Robert Douglas:  he messages me
[05/28/2007 12:11:32 AM] BJCullinan: k
[05/28/2007 12:11:32 AM] Robert Douglas:  we send each other convos and such
[05/28/2007 12:12:07 AM] Robert Douglas:  btw, ur jambonie check should be their this week
[05/28/2007 12:12:13 AM] BJCullinan: so i wasn't giving you attitude, i just knew before we started this conversation that i would need to talk to alex about business stuff, not server or tech stuff
[05/28/2007 12:12:14 AM] Robert Douglas:  i dunno what post office does about the holiday
[05/28/2007 12:12:42 AM] BJCullinan: probably won't deliver
[05/28/2007 12:13:29 AM] Robert Douglas: that's fine, but if you and I dont develop a relationship where we can talk, u wont be a partner
[05/28/2007 12:13:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex and i talk and argue all the time, it is part of business
[05/28/2007 12:13:56 AM] BJCullinan: i don't have a problem talking to you, i have a problem arguing with you
[05/28/2007 12:14:11 AM] Robert Douglas:  and you need to learn sooner or later that just because someone doesn't agree with you automatically, doesn't mean you are right/wrong or that they dont like/dislike you
[05/28/2007 12:14:24 AM] BJCullinan: i don't want to argue, i want things to get done, and i would be more then happy to explain my fathers point of view on the matter
[05/28/2007 12:14:39 AM] BJCullinan: he addressed this exact situation when he was giving me a lecture on business management
[05/28/2007 12:14:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  there are going to be tons of disagreements and discussiong (also arguments if you will)
[05/28/2007 12:14:48 AM] Robert Douglas:  so get used to it
[05/28/2007 12:15:12 AM] BJCullinan: i know there are going to be disagreements, but that doesn't mean you argue about it
[05/28/2007 12:15:14 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex and I have NEVER had a problem that we couldn't resolve
[05/28/2007 12:15:25 AM] Robert Douglas:  maybe discuss is a better word to use than argue
[05/28/2007 12:15:32 AM] BJCullinan: doesn't matter
[05/28/2007 12:15:32 AM] Robert Douglas:  because we always discuss something in full
[05/28/2007 12:15:46 AM] BJCullinan: you explain both sides and one is chosen period
[05/28/2007 12:15:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  if it isnt discussed, it wont happen
[05/28/2007 12:15:54 AM] Robert Douglas:  not always
[05/28/2007 12:15:55 AM] BJCullinan: sometimes things are going to go the way you want them to
[05/28/2007 12:16:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  sometimes there is another side
[05/28/2007 12:16:11 AM] BJCullinan: because either way, and path is going to need to be chosen
[05/28/2007 12:16:13 AM] Robert Douglas:  that's why you discuss your best options
[05/28/2007 12:16:58 AM] BJCullinan: yes you discuss options, but you don't need to argue about with way is better, because in the end, a path must be taken, a side must be chosen, and by arguing you are only postponing the inevitable
[05/28/2007 12:17:27 AM] BJCullinan: that is why having a partnership is harder, because both of you have equal authority, and when you disagree, it can't be resolved easily
[05/28/2007 12:17:51 AM] Robert Douglas:  except by arguing/discussing, we pick out problems that we might have ran into
[05/28/2007 12:18:22 AM] BJCullinan: that you "might have ran into"? that sounds ridiculous, so now you are trying to predict the future
[05/28/2007 12:18:33 AM] Robert Douglas:  of course, prepare for the future, today
[05/28/2007 12:18:38 AM] BJCullinan: both paths are going to have benefits and disadvantages
[05/28/2007 12:18:48 AM] Robert Douglas:  if you are going to do something, you need to make sure it is going to work and accomplish what you want
[05/28/2007 12:18:57 AM] BJCullinan: it doesn't matter because either way, a path will be chosen, so there is no point in arguing
[05/28/2007 12:19:10 AM] Robert Douglas:  you need to discuss the options
[05/28/2007 12:19:26 AM] BJCullinan: this is why the company is moving so slow, is because we spend for time discussing possible alternatives and it takes too long to just choose a path
[05/28/2007 12:19:27 AM] Robert Douglas:  we used to use worldcrm for our CRM software
[05/28/2007 12:19:37 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex and i both had ideas about what to do with our CRM
[05/28/2007 12:19:51 AM] Robert Douglas:  and after I suggested the open source Sugar, and alex suggested the World Do CRM
[05/28/2007 12:19:57 AM] Robert Douglas:  we ended up with a compeltely different solution
[05/28/2007 12:20:04 AM] Robert Douglas:  AFTER many many discussions
[05/28/2007 12:20:07 AM] BJCullinan: there should not even be very much discussion, different paths should be well thought out and presented, and one should be chosen
[05/28/2007 12:20:34 AM] Robert Douglas:  that's true, the only reason why we discuss so much,is because the initial proposal doesn't cover ALL questions
[05/28/2007 12:20:48 AM] Robert Douglas:  you should just be able to look at it and say yes or no, but it never works like that
[05/28/2007 12:20:59 AM] BJCullinan: see in that situation lists of advantages and disadvantages with each package should have been presented and one should have been chosen based on that
[05/28/2007 12:21:05 AM] Robert Douglas:  one example is the svn info that you put together, you didn't take into account the user control
[05/28/2007 12:21:11 AM] Robert Douglas:  and that was the deciding factor to NOT use it
[05/28/2007 12:21:22 AM] Robert Douglas:  because of that, we had a HUGE discussion, because of the exact problem you listed
[05/28/2007 12:21:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  you dont always have to use the presented example, you need to use the best one, maybe it will be a combo of both
[05/28/2007 12:22:05 AM] Robert Douglas:  when we picked out the CRM, neither of our proposals made it
[05/28/2007 12:22:16 AM] Robert Douglas:  we ended up going with something different from what both of us pitched
[05/28/2007 12:22:20 AM] BJCullinan: see thats where you are wrong, since you are in a partnership you will never understand that yes or no IS all it takes, because no matter how much time you spend arguing about it, one must be chosen, and if you were in control of everything in a sole proprietorship you would be saying yes or no
[05/28/2007 12:22:48 AM] Robert Douglas:  when i was working without alex,  i still got advice from other people, including him
[05/28/2007 12:23:04 AM] Robert Douglas:  in the business world, it isn't always a yes/no
[05/28/2007 12:23:15 AM] Robert Douglas:  especially when the proposals dont contain all of the information
[05/28/2007 12:23:18 AM] BJCullinan: we should have never had a discussion about the SVN, you should have put together a list of things it MUST have before i even started formulating ideas about it
[05/28/2007 12:23:52 AM] BJCullinan: and you should have presented those requirements to me, and for some reason maybe out of lack of respect, the time was never spent of making that list of requirements
[05/28/2007 12:23:55 AM] Robert Douglas:  you should have KNOWN about what you were trying to fix or help with, before wasting ur time and pitching an idea
[05/28/2007 12:24:12 AM] BJCullinan: you just kind of told me some of them online, and now we are still without a version control system
[05/28/2007 12:24:14 AM] Robert Douglas:  never go do something without knowing why you are doing it
[05/28/2007 12:24:28 AM] Robert Douglas:  you wasted your time with the SVN, just like i said you were going to
[05/28/2007 12:24:46 AM] BJCullinan: so i have given up on the project entirely, a decision was never made, and i don't feel i need to prove myself worthy of taking charge of it anymore
[05/28/2007 12:24:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  i felt bad knowing u put together a rather nice proposal too
[05/28/2007 12:25:01 AM] Robert Douglas:  the decision was to hold off on it
[05/28/2007 12:25:16 AM] Robert Douglas:  and that since it doesnt have better user control, we might not be able to use it
[05/28/2007 12:25:18 AM] BJCullinan: i should have recieved a similar document explaining what was required
[05/28/2007 12:25:26 AM] BJCullinan: maybe even then next day before our meeting
[05/28/2007 12:25:51 AM] Robert Douglas:  some things are common sense
[05/28/2007 12:25:55 AM] Robert Douglas:  but you're new to the business world
[05/28/2007 12:26:10 AM] BJCullinan: it would have been nice if you put something together, so you are right i did waste a lot of time putting together possible configurations, when i never understood what was required in the first place, because you never sent me anything
[05/28/2007 12:26:26 AM] BJCullinan: but we don't need to play the blame game, it is not constructive
[05/28/2007 12:26:28 AM] Robert Douglas:  you should have known right away that as a business, we wouldn't want people to be able to see other client folders and such
[05/28/2007 12:26:49 AM] Robert Douglas:  i guarantee that anyone else pitching the svn idea to us, wuld have kept that in mind
[05/28/2007 12:27:21 AM] Robert Douglas:  you would know there needs to be a user and pass to access the folder, it should be 100-% assumed that you should NOT be able to view the existance of a folder, without being logged into that specific account
[05/28/2007 12:27:48 AM] Robert Douglas:  if you need info from me to put something togther, dont waste time doing it without that info, just ask for it
[05/28/2007 12:28:05 AM] BJCullinan: absolute fallacy, i should not be expected to know everything is required, do i run our servers?  you however are expected to put together notes that express your ideas, i know the capabilities of svn now, but i have no idea what kind of configurations we should have
[05/28/2007 12:28:44 AM] BJCullinan: so i wasted a lot of time putting together example configurations, but my initial proposal was incredibly well thought out and well organized
[05/28/2007 12:28:46 AM] Robert Douglas:  but you know about the need for the user control, and with that you should have known that users logged in,should NOT be allowed to view what folders are available
[05/28/2007 12:29:07 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, it was very well done, both alex and myself agreed on that
[05/28/2007 12:29:21 AM] BJCullinan: you did not have a proper rebutl, and i think that is because of lack of organization or respect for me
[05/28/2007 12:29:42 AM] BJCullinan: i know about the need for user control NOW, after our meeting and the examples i worked out
[05/28/2007 12:29:43 AM] Robert Douglas:  yes i did,i told you that a logged in user can see other client folders
[05/28/2007 12:29:54 AM] Robert Douglas:  that was the rebutl
[05/28/2007 12:30:03 AM] Robert Douglas:  and u were never able to provide a working solution
[05/28/2007 12:30:06 AM] Robert Douglas:  so we just dropped it
[05/28/2007 12:30:15 AM] Robert Douglas:  you were close, very close
[05/28/2007 12:30:17 AM] BJCullinan: well it should have been written in a similar document to mine, and well planned out on your side as well
[05/28/2007 12:30:33 AM] Robert Douglas:  you never told me that you didn't know what you were trying to fix
[05/28/2007 12:31:23 AM] BJCullinan: i feel like our meetings don't progress as well as they should
[05/28/2007 12:31:31 AM] Robert Douglas:  the svn for client sites is going to be for developers to access the client's area, you (as the presentor of the SVN), should assume that the person is only able to access that specific client's folder
[05/28/2007 12:31:46 AM] BJCullinan: things are kind of made up as we go along, in the chats that we call meetings
[05/28/2007 12:31:55 AM] Robert Douglas:  and due to that assumption (very reasonable assumption too), you should also assume that being able to see the folder, is NOT restricted access
[05/28/2007 12:32:08 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, remember when alex tried to propose the BM role?
[05/28/2007 12:32:13 AM] Robert Douglas:  i told him to come back with something prepared
[05/28/2007 12:32:22 AM] Robert Douglas:  he did with the next day, and after reading it over, i told him it was a good idea
[05/28/2007 12:32:25 AM] BJCullinan: yes, thats a good example
[05/28/2007 12:32:48 AM] BJCullinan: but how long did we spend arguing about what his role was?
[05/28/2007 12:32:54 AM] BJCullinan: 10? 20? minutes?
[05/28/2007 12:33:03 AM] Robert Douglas:  took forever to understand what his role was about, because he didn't prepare it
[05/28/2007 12:33:12 AM] BJCullinan: all that time could have been saved if it was well prepared like my proposal?
[05/28/2007 12:33:15 AM] Robert Douglas:  we talked for a long time baout it, due to lack of preperation
[05/28/2007 12:33:21 AM] BJCullinan: yes
[05/28/2007 12:33:24 AM] Robert Douglas:  exactly
[05/28/2007 12:33:32 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex knows that now
[05/28/2007 12:33:34 AM] BJCullinan: these are the types of things we really should fix for future meetings
[05/28/2007 12:33:44 AM] BJCullinan: these are things that cause us not to get along well
[05/28/2007 12:33:45 AM] Robert Douglas:  yup, i agree, i made a note to alex about it
[05/28/2007 12:33:52 AM] BJCullinan: and end up wasting time arguing
[05/28/2007 12:34:05 AM] Robert Douglas:  there is a lot of discussing for any idea
[05/28/2007 12:34:18 AM] Robert Douglas:  nobody is ever going to take a new idea and just say yes or no
[05/28/2007 12:34:32 AM] Robert Douglas:  they are going to discuss it a bit, see if there are ways to improve it, and then decide if it will work
[05/28/2007 12:35:07 AM] BJCullinan: so when i write up a new proposal for document handling, i will include svn and provide and example, multiple senarios so one can be chosen, now that we had our meeting about it, that was also not well prepared, i know what is required for it
[05/28/2007 12:35:22 AM] Robert Douglas:  yup
[05/28/2007 12:35:38 AM] Robert Douglas:  i think the DM stuff might work well in the SVN, but i dont think it is as needed as the svn for client websites
[05/28/2007 12:35:58 AM] BJCullinan: if i don't get the senarios correct, another meeting between you and i should be scheduled, not discussed in the chat
[05/28/2007 12:36:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  we'd rather see a fix for the client website svn, than implement a DM svn
[05/28/2007 12:36:43 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, but i wouldnt talk about the DM until we get the website svn stuff done
[05/28/2007 12:36:53 AM] BJCullinan: i think we need an entire protocol for handling documents, part of which will include handling the client websites
[05/28/2007 12:37:11 AM] Robert Douglas:  like i said before, it will be much easier to keep it separated
[05/28/2007 12:37:19 AM] Robert Douglas:  but it is up to you if you want to still keep it together
[05/28/2007 12:37:22 AM] BJCullinan: svn is just a part of document management, and i agree that website svn can be used sooner then DM stuff
[05/28/2007 12:37:59 AM] BJCullinan: so we do need to take care of website svn, but document management will be developed over time
[05/28/2007 12:38:10 AM] BJCullinan: once we figure out all the types of documents we will need to be working with
[05/28/2007 12:38:16 AM] BJCullinan: they will be seperate as well
[05/28/2007 12:38:32 AM] BJCullinan: there will multiple svn, if we ever do implement a document svn
[05/28/2007 12:38:48 AM] BJCullinan: but it is all organization protocol, and i am very good with organization
[05/28/2007 12:38:53 AM] Robert Douglas:  yeah, and also keep in mind about scalability
[05/28/2007 12:39:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  sooner or later, we will put the svn on its' own server
[05/28/2007 12:39:12 AM] BJCullinan: yeah of course
[05/28/2007 12:41:08 AM] BJCullinan: as far as my current progress goes, either we restart apache every time we change permissions to an svn, which is possible if we run seperate apache threads just for handling svn, which might happen anyways if need apache 2 setup
[05/28/2007 12:41:10 AM] BJCullinan: OR
[05/28/2007 12:41:39 AM] Robert Douglas:  i dont like the restart, because any devs logged in will be logged out
[05/28/2007 12:42:10 AM] BJCullinan: we just use svnserve, which we can do currently without installing anything else, and we create a seperate set of svn config for each project, and each can have its own set of users and passwords
[05/28/2007 12:42:59 AM] BJCullinan: i think that is the better option
[05/28/2007 12:43:08 AM] Robert Douglas:  yup, that sounds like it might work
[05/28/2007 12:43:27 AM] Robert Douglas:  we could create an SVN Admin Manager program that will automatically configure each new svn config
[05/28/2007 12:43:49 AM] BJCullinan: that would not be too much trouble
[05/28/2007 12:44:14 AM] BJCullinan: but is one disadvantage and that is list out all client websites in the same directory view we are used to
[05/28/2007 12:45:47 AM] Robert Douglas:  admin/admin (Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/
[05/28/2007 12:46:20 AM] Robert Douglas:  we would also need to be able to have our lead developers, such as yourself and myself, complete access to ALL client websites(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:46:24 AM] BJCullinan: for example, and i haven't worked out all the bugs, but currently if we use the second method, we can create all the client websites in a folder such as Clients on the filesystem
[05/28/2007 12:46:29 AM] Robert Douglas:  we'll have like a superadministrator, and you will be one(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:46:48 AM] BJCullinan: but we can't list out the websites in SVN
[05/28/2007 12:46:58 AM] BJCullinan: however on the websvn system we CAN
[05/28/2007 12:47:06 AM] BJCullinan: understnad?
[05/28/2007 12:47:10 AM] Robert Douglas:  yup(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:47:16 AM] Robert Douglas:  i got azrn shit installed(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:47:22 AM] Robert Douglas:  after being on phone with yahoo for an hour(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:47:38 AM] Robert Douglas:  their control panel is so fucking lame(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:48:09 AM] BJCullinan: lol sucks
[05/28/2007 12:51:01 AM] BJCullinan: so, i am going to put together a fuller senario for svn, sometime this week lets have a breif meeting to present it?
[05/28/2007 12:51:40 AM] Robert Douglas:  sounds good, u and i should talk about it all before we pitch it to alex(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:52:02 AM] Robert Douglas:  alex wont know abotu the requirements, but he might find some holes in the logic from a business side(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:52:39 AM] BJCullinan: yes will you be around tuesday and wednesday to make sure i haven't got it wrong?
[05/28/2007 12:52:56 AM] Robert Douglas:  tuesday at night yes(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:53:00 AM] BJCullinan: make sure i don't forget anything and answer any questions i have about requirements
[05/28/2007 12:53:01 AM] Robert Douglas:  wednesday maybe not(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:53:14 AM] BJCullinan: ok, tuesday i should be able to work on it, i'll keep in touch
[05/28/2007 12:53:22 AM] Robert Douglas:  btw, it is better coding practice to use require_once instead of includes, for files that include settings(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:53:24 AM] BJCullinan: and tomorrow i will take a look at jambonie upload
[05/28/2007 12:53:33 AM] Robert Douglas:  (Link: http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Membership-Signup.php)http://www.azradiologyrn.net/Membership-Signup.php compared to (Link: http://dev.rp-s.com/Membership-Signup.php)http://dev.rp-s.com/Membership-Signup.php(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:53:39 AM] Robert Douglas:  thanks about the jambonie stuff(Link: http://azradiologyrn.net/dbadmin/)
[05/28/2007 12:53:50 AM] Robert Douglas:  since you used include() instead of require
[05/28/2007 12:53:54 AM] BJCullinan: ok, must have just slipped my mind, usually i do require
[05/28/2007 12:53:59 AM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt give the error emssage that the file wasnt found
[05/28/2007 12:54:03 AM] Robert Douglas:  alright
[05/28/2007 12:54:03 AM] Robert Douglas:  cool
[05/28/2007 12:54:21 AM] BJCullinan: thursday ready to present svn?
