[03/31/2008 09:32:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: now that i can get anything i don't know what to get
[03/31/2008 09:32:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: you can use my login if you want to
[03/31/2008 09:32:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: get 10 more connections
[03/31/2008 09:34:19 PM] Joe Flieger: you can set nl to 10 coonctions at a time
[03/31/2008 09:34:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: i know
[03/31/2008 09:34:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you could add another set of 10 connections
[03/31/2008 09:34:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: and use mine
[03/31/2008 09:34:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: since i am not
[03/31/2008 09:35:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you are downloading stuff right now
[03/31/2008 09:35:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so instead of doing thumbnails of a video, i think i should extract like a 30 second clip and play that
[03/31/2008 09:36:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you think?
[03/31/2008 09:36:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am working on my project for xml class it has to be impressive
[03/31/2008 09:42:59 PM] Joe Flieger: sry was doing soming thing
[03/31/2008 09:44:01 PM] Joe Flieger: not sure how that makes it more xml fancy
[03/31/2008 09:44:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am just going to display lots of fancy stuff
[03/31/2008 09:44:36 PM] Joe Flieger: i see
[03/31/2008 09:44:51 PM] Joe Flieger: not sure how ez that is going to be then
[03/31/2008 09:44:55 PM] Joe Flieger: with keyframs
[03/31/2008 09:45:04 PM] Joe Flieger: and creating clips
[03/31/2008 09:45:10 PM] Joe Flieger: and where to creat the clip
[03/31/2008 09:45:33 PM] Joe Flieger: first 15s my be just black space
[03/31/2008 09:45:48 PM] Joe Flieger: then agin so may the first frame
[03/31/2008 09:45:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was going to skip 3 seconds then record the next 15
[03/31/2008 09:46:05 PM] Joe Flieger: and that makes it harder
[03/31/2008 09:46:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just think the preview should be the same medium you know?
[03/31/2008 09:46:16 PM] Joe Flieger: cuz all the video info is in the first part of the file
[03/31/2008 09:46:25 PM] Joe Flieger: so u cant just chop at 15 sec
[03/31/2008 09:46:30 PM] Joe Flieger: ull have to do a reencode
[03/31/2008 09:46:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes i know i will have to reencode
[03/31/2008 09:47:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: that is what ffmpeg on a linux command line is for
[03/31/2008 09:47:03 PM] Joe Flieger: no u wouldnt for first 15 sec
[03/31/2008 09:47:40 PM] Joe Flieger: if u cut off the last part of the file in this case everything but the first 15 sec then no reencode is neded
[03/31/2008 09:47:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't worry about how
[03/31/2008 09:47:55 PM] Joe Flieger: then agin it will be full size and quality ... iono if thats what u want
[03/31/2008 09:47:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: how is not a problem
[03/31/2008 09:48:44 PM] Joe Flieger: lots of extra processing the first time through i guess
[03/31/2008 09:48:55 PM] Joe Flieger: not all bad
[03/31/2008 09:48:57 PM] Joe Flieger: ne how
[03/31/2008 09:49:24 PM] Joe Flieger: might want to do something cool like 15s of vid for every iono 15 min?
[03/31/2008 09:50:26 PM] Joe Flieger: and on that know u ever used avs?
[03/31/2008 09:51:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: well i will have another view viewer, where you can play a little playbar over the thumbnail and it will start playing the thumbnail and when you click it will play the video from that position in a bigger area
[03/31/2008 10:14:42 PM] Joe Flieger: if there xvid vids you could just stream the vids with the new divix browser plugin
[03/31/2008 10:15:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can make them that
[03/31/2008 10:15:50 PM] Joe Flieger: bascily if they are avi's in any format
[03/31/2008 10:15:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i was just going to let the user choose between quicktime, flash, and windows media player and stream them through that
[03/31/2008 10:16:01 PM] Joe Flieger: the new divix browser pluging could stream it for u
[03/31/2008 10:26:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i figure if i make some fancy displays along with the rss stuff he will want to give me more credit
[03/31/2008 10:31:24 PM] Joe Flieger: is this for 2 weeks worth of stuff?
