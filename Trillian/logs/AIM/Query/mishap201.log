[06/06/2007 01:33:15 PM] BJCullinan: yeah whats up?
[06/06/2007 01:33:32 PM] Andrew McVey: whats the biggest difference between classic rock and modern rock 
[06/06/2007 01:33:37 PM] Andrew McVey: in your words
[06/06/2007 01:34:27 PM] BJCullinan: there is a lot
[06/06/2007 01:34:39 PM] BJCullinan: significance of lyrics
[06/06/2007 01:34:52 PM] Andrew McVey: thats a good one 
[06/06/2007 01:34:53 PM] BJCullinan: modern rock artist tend to sing about things less meaningful
[06/06/2007 01:35:07 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah in some cases ...
[06/06/2007 01:35:09 PM] BJCullinan: stuff that you can't really relate to, or stuff that doesn't matter
[06/06/2007 01:35:28 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[06/06/2007 01:35:29 PM] Andrew McVey: ok
[06/06/2007 01:35:31 PM] BJCullinan: overpowering the voice with drumbs and quitar
[06/06/2007 01:35:42 PM] BJCullinan: not well balanced
[06/06/2007 01:35:54 PM] Andrew McVey: in what modern or classic?
[06/06/2007 01:36:02 PM] BJCullinan: in modern
[06/06/2007 01:37:31 PM] BJCullinan: the voice tone is different, classic has a lot of harmonic voices that sound well together, modern has fewer voices (mostly solo singers) that are a lot of times lower and only sound good alone
[06/06/2007 01:37:44 PM] Andrew McVey: oh
[06/06/2007 01:37:46 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[06/06/2007 01:38:06 PM] Andrew McVey: im writing a paper on biggest differences
[06/06/2007 01:38:41 PM] BJCullinan: and the integrity of the arists, a lot of classic rock artists are respectable and they treat their fame as a gift, and they have earned it, newer rock artists treat life like they deserve to have everything
[06/06/2007 01:38:54 PM] BJCullinan: thats an important one
[06/06/2007 01:38:58 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[06/06/2007 01:39:01 PM] Andrew McVey: thats some good stuff 
[06/06/2007 01:39:09 PM] Andrew McVey: unfortunately i cant be too biased
[06/06/2007 01:39:17 PM] Andrew McVey: i have to think about bnoth sides lol....
[06/06/2007 01:39:21 PM] BJCullinan: yeah well just make sure you work in that last one
[06/06/2007 01:39:28 PM] BJCullinan: try to find some posatives i guess
[06/06/2007 01:39:37 PM] Andrew McVey: but at the same time 
[06/06/2007 01:39:44 PM] Andrew McVey: older guys did so much drugs 
[06/06/2007 01:39:50 PM] Andrew McVey: ten times as much as today 
[06/06/2007 01:40:07 PM] BJCullinan: modern rock artists i guess try to go further with their music, and thats why they get cocky
[06/06/2007 01:40:10 PM] Andrew McVey: and they had so much more sex (because they could get it) than today 
[06/06/2007 01:41:15 PM] BJCullinan: yeah, but most modern rock artist look emo, when gene simons wore tight leather he got girls, when greenday wears tight black jeans and comb their hair over their eyes, they look like cutters
[06/06/2007 01:41:51 PM] Andrew McVey: lol

[08/21/2007 04:44:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a feature of NTFS called a sparse file, NTFS doesn't store zeros it only keeps track of them
[08/21/2007 04:44:54 PM] Andrew McVey: how much money is that worth
[08/21/2007 04:45:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could buy a TB drive for about 400 dollars
[08/21/2007 04:46:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: so a thousand of them would be 400 thousand dollars
[08/21/2007 04:47:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: not to much for a petabyte, but there would be so much maintenance on 1000 hard drives it would cost well over a million to cool them and replace them, so probably about 80 thousand a year just spent on cooling
[08/21/2007 04:47:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: and of course of parts to house them and run them

[02/02/2008 09:57:55 AM] Andrew McVey: yes?
[02/02/2008 09:58:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: we are having a gaming party via the CS department for campus (usually about 30 people show up) with consoles and like 10 flatscreen TVs, and possible more PC gaming support this time
[02/02/2008 09:59:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: do you think you and chase might be interested in hanging out that weekend up here and playing at a LAN party
[02/02/2008 09:59:13 AM] Andrew McVey: yeah maybe 
[02/02/2008 09:59:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to push for some tournaments too
[02/02/2008 09:59:17 AM] Andrew McVey: what games?
[02/02/2008 09:59:22 AM] Andrew McVey: CS?
[02/02/2008 10:01:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah probably some of the time
[02/02/2008 10:01:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am going to push for UT3 and maybe some Q3 mods
[02/02/2008 10:01:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe a little Q2
[02/02/2008 10:01:54 AM] Andrew McVey: yeah as long as its not like cs and world of warcraft
[02/02/2008 10:02:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah CS sucks
[02/02/2008 10:02:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: richard is pretty set on playing some Q2 with me so we will spend at least some time there
[02/02/2008 10:05:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i will have to get back to you after the meeting because it might not be very PC oriented, in which case you guys could wait until the next LAN party where we make it PC only
[02/02/2008 10:08:56 AM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[02/02/2008 10:08:57 AM] Andrew McVey: well

[02/11/2008 07:33:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i based the timelimit, caplimit, and respawn, based on how much they enjoy, how easy it is to score, and how big the map is
[02/11/2008 07:33:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: consecutively
[02/11/2008 07:33:56 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[02/11/2008 07:33:58 PM] Andrew McVey: i understand 
[02/11/2008 07:34:11 PM] Andrew McVey: but i would go with the same time limit for all 
[02/11/2008 07:34:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: 15 minutes?
[02/11/2008 07:34:22 PM] Andrew McVey: becuase you dont know who likes those maps and who hates them 
[02/11/2008 07:34:28 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 15 or 20
[02/11/2008 07:34:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah well some people will like them and some people won't but it seems to be the general consensus
[02/11/2008 07:35:02 PM] Andrew McVey: and i'd put more custom maps on it
[02/11/2008 07:35:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: timelimit is also based on size of map
[02/11/2008 07:35:14 PM] Andrew McVey: yeah 
[02/11/2008 07:35:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: like kingdom and uptown are bigger
