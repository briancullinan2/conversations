[09/11/2007 06:32:05 PM] Chelsea Dishman: lol orange? thats cool
[09/11/2007 06:32:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: its sunset, and the clouds are just barely above the sun, so even though its raining you can see the colors of sunset
[09/11/2007 06:33:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats why i love it here
[09/11/2007 06:33:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: its not always hot, you can see the seasons change
[09/11/2007 06:34:14 PM] Chelsea Dishman: yeah.. im not a snow bunny though
[09/11/2007 06:34:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol, that would be awfully cute to see you in a big puffy jacket, or ski clothing
[09/11/2007 06:35:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: *ski/snowboarding
[09/11/2007 06:35:04 PM] Chelsea Dishman: haha
[09/11/2007 06:35:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can't remember which you prefer
[09/11/2007 06:35:08 PM] Chelsea Dishman: snowboarding
[09/11/2007 06:42:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: "one who knows the enemy and knows himself will not be endangered in a hundred engagements:
[09/11/2007 06:43:12 PM] Chelsea Dishman: i should quote Jay-Z right about now
[09/11/2007 06:43:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: what would you say?
[09/11/2007 06:45:20 PM] Chelsea Dishman: "this is nothing to me, difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week.  I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessing I can sell CD's. I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man. Let me handle my business, damn"
[09/11/2007 06:45:24 PM] Chelsea Dishman: thats what I would say
[09/11/2007 06:46:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would say "Nurture the enemy for our use. This is called 'conquering the enemy and growing stronger'"
[09/11/2007 06:46:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: its more valuable to acquire the enemy, then to destroy it
[09/11/2007 06:47:04 PM] Chelsea Dishman: nono
[09/11/2007 06:47:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i apply that to life almost every day
[09/11/2007 06:47:12 PM] Chelsea Dishman: destroy it - just at the right time
[09/11/2007 06:48:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: no, convince them to join your side, it is more profitable for both sides
[09/11/2007 06:49:11 PM] Chelsea Dishman: yeah - until the right time
[09/11/2007 06:49:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: often times strategies or war can be applied to economics and business
[09/11/2007 06:49:55 PM] Chelsea Dishman: or life in general
[09/11/2007 06:51:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: and selling coke isn't really a good business plan
[09/11/2007 06:51:19 PM] Chelsea Dishman: haha
[09/11/2007 06:51:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't think Jay-Z was talking about the soda
[09/11/2007 06:51:22 PM] Chelsea Dishman: you should try it
[09/11/2007 06:53:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: people resort to crime when they are not intelligent enough to solve their own problems
[09/11/2007 06:54:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't need to sell illegal substances for more then they are worth because i have a company to run, and a new job in the engineering building
[09/11/2007 06:54:10 PM] Chelsea Dishman: do you think i am unintelligent?
[09/11/2007 06:54:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you sell coke?
[09/11/2007 06:54:44 PM] Chelsea Dishman: that wasnt the question
[09/11/2007 06:55:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's all i was referring to, but no i think you are intelligent, you are very kind too
[09/11/2007 06:56:35 PM] Chelsea Dishman: so why are you telling me all these things as if i do not know them?
[09/11/2007 06:56:46 PM] Chelsea Dishman: and im not kind... im not feeling kind today :(
[09/11/2007 06:56:58 PM] Chelsea Dishman: bad bad day

[09/11/2007 06:57:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: why such a bad day?
[09/11/2007 06:57:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sorry, i didn't mean to upset you

[09/11/2007 07:01:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: i saw you updated your pictures on facebook a little while ago, i think you look great
[09/11/2007 07:01:38 PM] Chelsea Dishman: thanks - im just stressed out. i have two fashion shows in ten days and im just not losing weight
[09/11/2007 07:02:15 PM] Chelsea Dishman: normally id be fine. i like my body..  but when you are on display for other people and all the other models are like sickly thin.. it makes me feel shittttay
[09/11/2007 07:04:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: well you can't starve yourself, i am sure you will look amazing, you have always been gorgeous which is better then sickly thin
[09/11/2007 07:04:56 PM] Chelsea Dishman: i agree
[09/11/2007 07:05:03 PM] Chelsea Dishman: but not in modellinng

[09/11/2007 07:05:58 PM] Chelsea Dishman: not in ads
[09/11/2007 07:06:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: then you shouldn't worry about it, just don't resort to your comfort food because of the stress, its an endless cycle
[09/11/2007 07:06:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i'm sure you've heard that before
[09/11/2007 07:06:37 PM] Chelsea Dishman: im female
[09/11/2007 07:06:39 PM] Chelsea Dishman: lol
[09/11/2007 07:06:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you want to be in ads someday?

[09/11/2007 07:07:54 PM] Chelsea Dishman: i like tequila.. house..premium..anything
[09/11/2007 07:08:01 PM] Chelsea Dishman: for real. all of it
[09/11/2007 07:08:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: ahaha, well i don't think you will gain much wait off of that
[09/11/2007 07:08:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: but drinking alone is the first sign of alcoholism, so you should come drink with me instead
[09/11/2007 07:09:00 PM] Chelsea Dishman: lol im not drinking alone silly
[09/11/2007 07:09:06 PM] Chelsea Dishman: well atleast not tonight
[09/11/2007 07:09:08 PM] Chelsea Dishman: ;)
[09/11/2007 07:09:40 PM] Chelsea Dishman: channing and i are having girls night :)
[09/11/2007 07:10:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's fun, good to hear you two are still friends
[09/11/2007 07:10:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: college seems to change a lot of relationships, i haven't talked to Dan in forever
[09/11/2007 07:10:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've always admired you
[09/11/2007 07:11:09 PM] Chelsea Dishman: why have you admired me?
[09/11/2007 07:12:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: despite the influences, i think your an amazing person, for example getting a brand new car after getting in an accident you don't act like a spoiled brat, or dating a few assholes in highschool and you still have time to make conversation with me, and being a model your still down to earth, not an airhead like most people that get absorbed into that industry
[09/11/2007 07:15:16 PM] Chelsea Dishman:  you made me smile today
[09/11/2007 07:15:41 PM] Chelsea Dishman: and yet i still feel like a brat. and i definitely did date a few assholes. haha
[09/11/2007 07:16:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i could, i'd try to make you smile everyday, i guess going to different schools makes that difficult
[09/11/2007 07:16:52 PM] Chelsea Dishman: haha maybe
[09/11/2007 07:17:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was talking to Cyrus last weekend, when we partied together, about how no matter what people see you as, or know you as (based on what you do), in his case being the pinnacle football team, its always important to live outside the stereo types
[09/11/2007 07:18:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: people know me as "that guy that's good with computers", but my friends know me as someone completely different then just a nerd.
[09/11/2007 07:19:04 PM] Chelsea Dishman: most people have a label - or something that people perceive them as. it is just human nature. and thats okay as long as you arent scared to move past it
[09/11/2007 07:19:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[09/11/2007 07:19:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hope no matter where your modeling career takes you, you always appreciate the people care for you
[09/11/2007 07:20:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i see so many terrible things that people in hollywood do on the news, and i worry, what will their children be like when they can't even behave themselves?
[09/11/2007 07:22:03 PM] Chelsea Dishman: oh i know.
[09/11/2007 07:22:09 PM] Chelsea Dishman: trust me, im not going that far
[09/11/2007 07:22:10 PM] Chelsea Dishman: lol
[09/11/2007 07:22:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: good, because i'd miss you if you moved to california
[09/11/2007 07:22:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: are you conservative or liberal?
[09/11/2007 07:22:38 PM] Chelsea Dishman: neither
[09/11/2007 07:22:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: moderate?
[09/11/2007 07:22:49 PM] Chelsea Dishman: :) i am me. 
[09/11/2007 07:22:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: or non-participant
[09/11/2007 07:23:00 PM] Chelsea Dishman: moderate i suppose
[09/11/2007 07:23:19 PM] Chelsea Dishman: my values are based on what i was brought up on... and what i have come to believe as my own woman
[09/11/2007 07:23:28 PM] Chelsea Dishman: they dont fit a mold.
