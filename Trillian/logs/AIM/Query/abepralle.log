[02/28/2008 11:32:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: Is there an easy way of converting primitives to bits and/or sending it to a bitwriter and having it write out the full length?

[02/28/2008 11:36:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: Is there an easy way of converting primitives to bits and/or sending it to a bitwriter and having it write out the full length?
[02/28/2008 11:36:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: Or is there a section that explains the functions that can be performed on primitives in more detail?
[02/28/2008 11:40:18 PM] Abe Pralle: Just the BitWriter should do the trick:
 Integers: write( n, 8/16/32/64 )
 Reals: write( as_Int32( r32 ), 32 ) or write( as_Int64( r64 ), 32 )
 Booleans: write( 1 ) or write( 0 )
[02/28/2008 11:41:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: I may have figured it out, i was doing a write on a file writer, when I needed to init: the BitWriter with a filewriter
[02/28/2008 11:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think it will work now
[02/28/2008 11:41:20 PM] Abe Pralle: cool
[02/28/2008 11:43:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: I am writing a serializer for each different recorded events
[02/28/2008 11:43:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: should make for a lot smaller files
[02/29/2008 12:00:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: Doesn't seem to be writing the correct value, it just writes zeroes with 0d0a on the end of the file.

[02/29/2008 12:11:34 AM] Abe Pralle: That's a LFCR or \n \r
[02/29/2008 12:13:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: looks like when i use write_low_high it outputs the correct value in reverse obviously, but when i use the general write (high_low) is doesn't output the integer at all.  Is this an error, or am i doing something wrong?
[02/29/2008 12:17:04 AM] Abe Pralle: write_low_high calls general write() as its definition, so it's definitely working
[02/29/2008 12:18:10 AM] Abe Pralle: Are you making sure to close() the file after writing?
[02/29/2008 12:18:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: Yes
[02/29/2008 12:18:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: It outputs lots of zeros then the LFCR
[02/29/2008 12:19:38 AM] Brian Cullinan: it prints out the correct number of zeros, but no value
[02/29/2008 12:20:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: Maybe i should e-mail you the game i created just for testing this.
[02/29/2008 12:21:36 AM] Abe Pralle: hmm, I'm getting something similar...
[02/29/2008 12:22:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: well that's good
[02/29/2008 12:22:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i broke my entire game to implement this new binary recording method with serialization, so it's not like i can fix it tonight

[02/29/2008 12:28:19 AM] Abe Pralle: [00:24] AbePralle: I'll post the new version with the fix here in a few, but if you want to fix it in the meantime: find the write(Int32,Int32) definition in BitWriter (in standard.slag) and chance the first line to look like this:
 [00:24] AbePralle:       value &= (Int64(1).left_shifted(n_bits) - 1)
   
 [00:24] AbePralle: (addition of an Int64 cast)

[02/29/2008 01:23:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: Hi
[02/29/2008 01:24:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: Is there a type of writer that i could write to temporarily, until the bits are written to a file?
[02/29/2008 01:24:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: Like a buffer
[02/29/2008 01:25:35 PM] Abe Pralle: Sure... a StringBuilder is a PrintWriter, so you can just wrap one of those in a BitWriter.
[02/29/2008 01:30:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok that should work
[02/29/2008 01:30:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: then i can clear the string builder or print it to a file

[03/02/2008 02:12:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: So it seems like when my game is playing it back the recorded information, it is going abnormally slow.  Do you think there could be any high cost functions when reading?  What is the cost of conversions between int64 and real64?
[03/02/2008 02:13:26 PM] Abe Pralle: Those conversions are fast.  How were you playing things back before?
[03/02/2008 02:13:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: before it was reading faster than it does now and i was doing tons and tons of string parsing
[03/02/2008 02:14:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it doesn't make any sense that this bit parsing would be slow
[03/02/2008 02:15:49 PM] Abe Pralle: No, it shouldn't be.  Both the bit reading and the text parsing are based on the same underlying mechanism of inputting a byte at a time, and text parsing definitely has more conversions involved with it.
[03/02/2008 02:17:30 PM] Abe Pralle: I would guess it's something else you changed since your previous version...
[03/02/2008 02:17:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: could be
[03/02/2008 02:18:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: but i am rewriting the entire mechanism for the recording so there is many changes to existing code, it is more re-doing, i am only recording the view position and the player position currently
[03/02/2008 02:20:58 PM] Abe Pralle: I don't follow
[03/02/2008 02:22:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: I just mean i don't know what change could affect the speed when i am rewriting the entire controller.
[03/02/2008 02:23:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: Weirder still the drawing seems to be fine, something wrong with how it is reading i guess.
[03/02/2008 02:27:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah i think i found the problem
[03/02/2008 02:51:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: So my recorder works now but I am still having some problems with the BitReader
[03/02/2008 02:58:36 PM] Abe Pralle: Have you isolated what they are?

[03/03/2008 11:27:26 AM] Abe Pralle: x' = x k / z, y' = y k / z
[03/03/2008 11:28:04 AM] Abe Pralle: Where x, y, and z are the 3D coordinates and k is a scaling constant so they don't disappear into the vanishing point too quickly.

[05/27/2008 01:48:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey
[05/27/2008 01:50:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: So i was thinking a good starting point for the GUI plugin as far as functionality goes would the be porting over the Java version
[05/27/2008 01:52:07 PM] Abe Pralle: Now let's see: we're talking about the idea of Plasmacore applets running in web pages, right?
[05/27/2008 01:53:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: I was just referring to making a GUI plugin for Slagcore.  Making it easier for someone to create menus and controls (buttons, scrollbars, etc.) for plasmacore
[05/27/2008 01:54:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: You said there was a GUI plugin for Javacore, so i thought it would be nice to get a copy of that to port over to slagcore as a starting point.
[05/27/2008 01:56:39 PM] Abe Pralle: Ahh, cool, I get ya - yeah, that'd be a good project.
[05/27/2008 01:58:13 PM] Abe Pralle: Getting your hands dirty first by porting the Java version would be a good start, but keep in mind I think it could use a bit of a rework by the end.
[05/27/2008 01:59:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes, but i thought it might be nice to use as a reference for what functionality the new one should have.
[05/27/2008 01:59:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i was thinking about basing controls and layout functionality on .Net, just because i think it is a lot easier to use then the swing crap.
[05/27/2008 01:59:56 PM] Abe Pralle: Here's a version of the old Java Plasmacore that includes the gui package:
