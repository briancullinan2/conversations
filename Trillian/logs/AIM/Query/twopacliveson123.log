[08/20/2007 05:05:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: is fuck dc++
[08/20/2007 05:06:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i hate hashing everything before anyone uses it
[08/20/2007 05:06:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: it blew out my hard drives last year reading my entire 2.5 TB system in 2.5 GB of memory
[08/20/2007 05:06:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: its ridiculous
[08/20/2007 05:06:37 PM] Tim Woods: lol
[08/20/2007 05:06:43 PM] Tim Woods: well how often do you hash?
[08/20/2007 05:06:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: it took me like a month last year to has 2.5 TB
[08/20/2007 05:07:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: and then i had to reinstall OS and rehash everything
[08/20/2007 05:07:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: then it crashed and i was teh sad
[08/20/2007 05:07:29 PM] Tim Woods: geez mine only takes max 8 hrs to hash 
[08/20/2007 05:07:44 PM] Tim Woods: lol bummer
[08/20/2007 05:07:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/20/2007 05:07:48 PM] Tim Woods: how's that raid 5 working out?
[08/20/2007 05:07:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: good
[08/20/2007 05:08:07 PM] Tim Woods: save everything when they died?
[08/20/2007 05:08:10 PM] Brian Cullinan: saved me once when my fans kept shorting out and currupted file system
[08/20/2007 05:08:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: last year 2 drives died at the same time
[08/20/2007 05:08:23 PM] Tim Woods: how'd that happen?
[08/20/2007 05:08:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: i bought seagate
[08/20/2007 05:08:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: fucking seagate
[08/20/2007 05:08:48 PM] Tim Woods: yeah i'm not likeing seagate as well
[08/20/2007 05:08:56 PM] Tim Woods: only drive i've had fail was a seagate
[08/20/2007 05:08:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you make it past the first month with a seagate then it will run for years, but making it past the first month is always a crap shoot
[08/20/2007 05:09:07 PM] Tim Woods: had such good deals on the 320's that they seem a little to good
[08/20/2007 05:09:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/20/2007 05:09:21 PM] Tim Woods: mine crapped at 4 mo or so
[08/20/2007 05:09:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: so the way i got TB files (and there is 4 of them), i created sparse files on ntfs
[08/20/2007 05:10:08 PM] Tim Woods: i wish i could get a raid 5 going but don't have a controlled for it
[08/20/2007 05:10:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Other/1%20petabyte.JPG)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Other/1%20petabyte.JPG

[08/20/2007 05:13:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: we might switch if they offer the speeds and fixed IP because i want cable

[08/20/2007 05:14:53 PM] Tim Woods: lol wow wtf's that from
[08/20/2007 05:14:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: my server
[08/20/2007 05:15:18 PM] Tim Woods: lol i'd like to see that
[08/20/2007 05:15:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: dude you stop by and i will show you
[08/20/2007 05:15:30 PM] Tim Woods: that's prob close to what googles got
[08/20/2007 05:15:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/20/2007 05:15:40 PM] Tim Woods: wait you actually have 1 pb?
[08/20/2007 05:15:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/20/2007 05:15:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe
[08/20/2007 05:15:58 PM] Tim Woods: lol that's what i though
[08/20/2007 05:16:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: pay attention!
[08/20/2007 05:16:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i already said
[08/20/2007 05:16:22 PM] Tim Woods: lol 
[08/20/2007 05:16:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am sharing TB files but they are sparse files, a feature of NTFS, NTFS doesn't store zeros, it only keeps track of them
[08/20/2007 05:17:02 PM] Tim Woods: so what are they used for?
[08/20/2007 05:17:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: sparse files aren't used, they are just what NTFS does, when you do stuff like use the compress option, or when you have a file with lots of empty space, NTFS will automatically remove all the zeros and only store a count
[08/20/2007 05:18:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: files aren't supposed to be sparse like the TB files i am sharing
[08/20/2007 05:18:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: its kind of a hack
[08/20/2007 05:18:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: but its a feature of NTFS
[08/20/2007 05:18:42 PM] Tim Woods: lol k that's what i was thinking
[08/20/2007 05:18:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so uh fuck dc++ 
 server crashed last year because of too much fucking hashing 
 if you want kool appz talk to me online 
 server admin (HeWasAJumperBoy) can get in touch with me or PM me 
  
 actual share size probably around 1.5TB (and growing) 
  
 here's the info (estimated): 
  
 Music = 80GB 
 DVDs = 600GB (100 on HDs, 340 shrunk and burned, i have alphabetized lists) 
 Videos = 100GB (ASSorted tv shows, veronica mars and deadwood yay!) 
 Pr0n = 500+GB (Met-Art.com, playboy, girls gone wild, etc., looking for 500GB hard drives to download more entire websites) 
 Appz = 200GB (Almost everything you can imagine, Adobe CS 3 too!) 
  
 -edited with gvim, wewt :D 
 
[08/20/2007 05:18:51 PM] Tim Woods: can it be used for anything?
[08/20/2007 05:18:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats my readme.txt
[08/20/2007 05:18:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: that should be the only thing you download
[08/20/2007 05:19:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes sparse files is really good
[08/20/2007 05:19:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: it makes it so files that are huge, can be compressed to smaller sizes on disk
[08/20/2007 05:19:28 PM] Tim Woods: k i'll go d/l it right now
[08/20/2007 05:19:35 PM] Tim Woods: still kinda confused on what it's gonna be used for
[08/20/2007 05:19:40 PM] Tim Woods: oh ok
[08/20/2007 05:19:50 PM] Tim Woods: but why would you want to do that?
[08/20/2007 05:19:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: even though that file is 1 TB, it is stored on disk as only 46kb
[08/20/2007 05:20:00 PM] Tim Woods: doesn't it take days to uncompress?
[08/20/2007 05:20:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: its a feature of the filesystem
[08/20/2007 05:20:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't download my sparse file
[08/20/2007 05:20:20 PM] Tim Woods: lol made that mistake earlier
[08/20/2007 05:20:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you download it, it will actually try to download 1 TB
[08/20/2007 05:20:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: and it will all be zeros so it will download so fast dc++ overloads
[08/20/2007 05:20:47 PM] Tim Woods: figured that's what it was locking up
[08/20/2007 05:20:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: i would never want to uncompress it
[08/20/2007 05:21:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: i don't have to to use it in dc++
[08/20/2007 05:21:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: sparse files are just a feature of NTFS, which is your filesystem, they aren't supposed to be used the way that i am using it
[08/20/2007 05:21:41 PM] Tim Woods: so it just keeps you on top of the filelist or what?
[08/20/2007 05:21:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: that and attracts attention
[08/20/2007 05:21:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you read my readme?
[08/20/2007 05:22:02 PM] Tim Woods: lol
[08/20/2007 05:22:05 PM] Tim Woods: no it's not up there
[08/20/2007 05:22:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats what people should really only download
[08/20/2007 05:22:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: so uh fuck dc++

 if you want kool appz talk to me online

[08/20/2007 05:22:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: thats the readme
[08/20/2007 05:22:39 PM] Tim Woods: oh though you were putting it in ur filelist k lemme read though it 
[08/20/2007 05:23:12 PM] Tim Woods: so ppl just ask you for the file and you send it?
[08/20/2007 05:23:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[08/20/2007 05:23:37 PM] Tim Woods: why not just deal w/ another hash and put everything up like normal?
[08/20/2007 05:23:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wrote a program, but its really just for me to make lists of software i have, but it supports file transfer
[08/20/2007 05:23:59 PM] Tim Woods: wanna send me the list?
[08/20/2007 05:24:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i don't want to hash 400 DVDs
[08/20/2007 05:24:11 PM] Tim Woods: ok so lets say i want cs3 how would i get if from you?
[08/20/2007 05:24:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could burn you a DVD and we meet in person
[08/20/2007 05:24:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: i could put it on a flash drive and we mee
[08/20/2007 05:24:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: t
[08/20/2007 05:24:42 PM] Tim Woods: i'm thinking about taking all my movies to dvd soon but def gonna want iso's so might be coming to you
[08/20/2007 05:24:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: you download it off my server when i send you a link
[08/20/2007 05:24:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: or you download my program and get access to everything
[08/20/2007 05:24:57 PM] Tim Woods: yeah send it 
[08/20/2007 05:25:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: without stupid hashing
[08/20/2007 05:25:09 PM] Tim Woods: am i gonna be the guinea pig?
[08/20/2007 05:25:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: i tested my prog with admin

[08/20/2007 05:26:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i haven't learned very much at all in CS
[08/20/2007 05:26:58 PM] Tim Woods: lol i'll bet
[08/20/2007 05:27:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: i might learn a lot this year
[08/20/2007 05:27:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've been programming since i was 10
[08/20/2007 05:27:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: i wrote this last program in 2 days
[08/20/2007 05:27:15 PM] Tim Woods: very nice
[08/20/2007 05:27:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: so lets beta test it
