[08/24/2007 11:27:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: don't care, it has jessica alba
[08/24/2007 11:27:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: omfg, some chick called me desperate yesterday
[08/24/2007 11:28:01 PM] Christina Sanders: really? who? why? what happened?
[08/24/2007 11:28:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: because i offered to help carry her bag up the stairs
[08/24/2007 11:28:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: she asked keifer if i was desperate after that
[08/24/2007 11:28:20 PM] Christina Sanders: ....
[08/24/2007 11:28:39 PM] Christina Sanders: holy shit wow...
[08/24/2007 11:28:41 PM] Christina Sanders: wow
[08/24/2007 11:28:55 PM] Christina Sanders: i wouldn't call just offereing to help and be nice, being desperate
[08/24/2007 11:29:00 PM] Brian Cullinan: and keifer fuckin told her i was desperate, what a douche bag
[08/24/2007 11:29:08 PM] Christina Sanders: what the fuck?
[08/24/2007 11:29:13 PM] Christina Sanders: what? he's stupid
[08/24/2007 11:29:19 PM] Christina Sanders: what's he trying to accomplish?
[08/24/2007 11:29:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm going to text him and call him an asshole
[08/24/2007 11:30:11 PM] Christina Sanders: you should
[08/24/2007 11:30:17 PM] Christina Sanders: he is one
[08/24/2007 11:30:39 PM] Christina Sanders: and should be reminded hourly... well not nesecarily by you
[08/24/2007 11:30:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: best comeback line ever though, if a girl asked me if i was desperate, i would be like "why do you ask? i mean just because i'm hitting on you, doesn't mean i'm desperate."
[08/24/2007 11:31:20 PM] Christina Sanders: haaa haa, yes
[08/24/2007 11:32:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: its kind of dick, but women suck sometimes, when you are in a relationship more women want you, and when you are out of a relationship all of a sudden you are desperate
[08/24/2007 11:32:33 PM] Christina Sanders: wow quite the insight
[08/24/2007 11:32:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/24/2007 11:32:38 PM] Christina Sanders: kinda sucks how that happens
[08/24/2007 11:32:47 PM] Christina Sanders: and i agree we women can be stupid at times
[08/24/2007 11:32:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: you know me and my strong opinions 
[08/24/2007 11:32:59 PM] Christina Sanders: we get way too defnesive at times
[08/24/2007 11:33:03 PM] Christina Sanders: oh i do
[08/24/2007 11:33:32 PM] Christina Sanders: i don't know what it is, probably the thrill of the chase, but taken men are always sought after and single ones are seen as losers who can't get anything
[08/24/2007 11:34:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: fuck the system
[08/24/2007 11:34:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: do you think i'm desperate?
[08/24/2007 11:34:48 PM] Christina Sanders: no
[08/24/2007 11:35:14 PM] Christina Sanders: you told me you were happier and better off single right now
[08/24/2007 11:35:22 PM] Brian Cullinan: i'm don't want to jump right into another relationship, i just wanted to help her with her bags, she lived next to keifer i figure i'd see her more then once
[08/24/2007 11:36:59 PM] Christina Sanders: did you say anything in particular to her? that would cause her to think you were desperate
[08/24/2007 11:37:13 PM] Christina Sanders: or did you just offer to take the bags up as a courtesy
[08/24/2007 11:37:15 PM] Christina Sanders: to be nice
[08/24/2007 11:37:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe it was that i offered 1 last time
[08/24/2007 11:37:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: she looked like she was struggling, not too tall and kept hitting the stairs
[08/24/2007 11:39:06 PM] Brian Cullinan: i asked her if she wanted help, then 20 minutes later i asked her again
[08/24/2007 11:39:54 PM] Christina Sanders: ah
[08/24/2007 11:40:05 PM] Christina Sanders: well she was struggling getting up the stairs.....
[08/24/2007 11:41:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe keifer was fucking with me
[08/24/2007 11:41:26 PM] Christina Sanders: it is keifer
[08/24/2007 11:41:31 PM] Christina Sanders: where is he living this year?

[08/25/2007 12:27:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg, seductive?
[08/25/2007 12:27:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: you can see her ass below her skirt
[08/25/2007 12:27:28 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah... she somehow convinces lex to marry her
[08/25/2007 12:27:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: jeese
[08/25/2007 12:27:34 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah...
[08/25/2007 12:28:08 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/25/2007 12:28:38 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah now that i think more about that episode totally something i can see you love
[08/25/2007 12:28:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: when does he get cold breath?
[08/25/2007 12:29:02 AM] Christina Sanders: i don't remember
[08/25/2007 12:29:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: he turns back time by flying around the earth right?
[08/25/2007 12:29:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats how he does it in the movies
[08/25/2007 12:29:36 AM] Christina Sanders: it's different in the show because he just learned how to fly
[08/25/2007 12:29:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: gay
[08/25/2007 12:29:47 AM] Christina Sanders: and i think its through a kryptonite crystal
[08/25/2007 12:30:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: when in all actuality i think it would just kill everyone on earth
[08/25/2007 12:30:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: if you turned it back
[08/25/2007 12:30:55 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah actually
[08/25/2007 12:30:57 AM] Christina Sanders: good thinking
[08/25/2007 12:31:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: she has some weird power
[08/25/2007 12:32:13 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah she has some sort of phermone she can release
[08/25/2007 12:32:38 AM] Christina Sanders: it's because when the metorites hit smallville she was in the middle of having sex and because of that she became super seductive
[08/25/2007 12:32:39 AM] Christina Sanders: lol
[08/25/2007 12:32:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/25/2007 12:33:22 AM] Christina Sanders: her's is one of the most "omfg are you serious" powers of all the meteor freaks
[08/25/2007 12:33:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: its kind of ridiculous that everything revolves around kryptonite
[08/25/2007 12:33:49 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[08/25/2007 12:34:04 AM] Christina Sanders: according to that show the kryptonite had more effect on the people around it that superman
[08/25/2007 12:34:43 AM] Christina Sanders: there's one episode where this gang uses the kryptonite as ink for tattos and gives them ability to walk through walls, stuff like that
[08/25/2007 12:34:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i remember that one
[08/25/2007 12:35:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: that one was pretty ridiculous
[08/25/2007 12:35:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: pheromone 
[08/25/2007 12:35:39 AM] Christina Sanders: made me giggle, not as much as the pheromone one though
[08/25/2007 12:35:40 AM] Christina Sanders: oh wow
[08/25/2007 12:35:42 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats what it is, when you are with a girl you release something different
[08/25/2007 12:35:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: i should look into that
[08/25/2007 12:35:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe there is a way to spoof it
[08/25/2007 12:35:59 AM] Christina Sanders: interesting study
[08/25/2007 12:36:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: you can look up the work spoof while i am looking at pheromones
[08/25/2007 12:36:34 AM] Christina Sanders: wait work spoof
[08/25/2007 12:36:37 AM] Christina Sanders: what do you mean by that
[08/25/2007 12:36:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: look up spoof
[08/25/2007 12:36:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: and you will know
[08/25/2007 12:37:51 AM] Christina Sanders: oh okay
[08/25/2007 12:39:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://pherotones.com/)http://pherotones.com/
[08/25/2007 12:39:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg lol
[08/25/2007 12:39:32 AM] Christina Sanders: holy shit
[08/25/2007 12:39:35 AM] Christina Sanders: people are doing that?
[08/25/2007 12:39:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/25/2007 12:40:02 AM] Christina Sanders: wow
[08/25/2007 12:40:04 AM] Christina Sanders: fuck, wow
[08/25/2007 12:41:05 AM] Christina Sanders: what exactly about spoofs do you want to know?
[08/25/2007 12:41:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol i know what a spoof is
[08/25/2007 12:42:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think it would be amusing to spoof a pheromone
[08/25/2007 12:42:41 AM] Christina Sanders: in the way you are talking about a spoof i have no idea what you are talking about
[08/25/2007 12:43:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: sry wrong definition
[08/25/2007 12:43:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: A generic term for misleading a computer system into believing that you are not who you say you are
[08/25/2007 12:43:25 AM] Christina Sanders: ah
[08/25/2007 12:43:33 AM] Christina Sanders: nice
[08/25/2007 12:43:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: so spoofing a pheromone would be like faking that you aren't desperate
[08/25/2007 12:43:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: :-(
[08/25/2007 12:43:42 AM] Christina Sanders: that would be entertaining to do that
[08/25/2007 12:46:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: omfg if i had powers i wouldn't be a loser
[08/25/2007 12:46:27 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would save everyone
[08/25/2007 12:46:31 AM] Christina Sanders: :-)
[08/25/2007 12:46:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would practice all the time
[08/25/2007 12:46:49 AM] Christina Sanders: are you becoming addicted to superman?
[08/25/2007 12:47:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[08/25/2007 12:47:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i'm not like you
[08/25/2007 12:47:52 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol

[08/25/2007 12:49:01 AM] Christina Sanders: you're enjoying superman more than you used to?
[08/25/2007 12:49:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: you never watched the old movies with me
[08/25/2007 12:49:31 AM] Brian Cullinan: and dave downloaded all the season, so i copied them over
[08/25/2007 12:49:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i also watched Rome and Deadwood this summer
[08/25/2007 12:49:48 AM] Christina Sanders: you never wanted to watch them with me
[08/25/2007 12:50:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did want to watch them with you
[08/25/2007 12:50:10 AM] Christina Sanders: well you could have told me
[08/25/2007 12:50:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: i did tell you
[08/25/2007 12:50:32 AM] Christina Sanders: i was under the impression you didn't want to as well as i remember asking to watch superman once and you said no

[10/14/2007 05:47:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: i thought we were going out like that first week
[10/14/2007 05:47:28 PM] Christina Sanders: we were going out as soon as you held my hand and kissed me
[10/14/2007 05:48:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we got to first base before second
[10/14/2007 05:48:27 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah
