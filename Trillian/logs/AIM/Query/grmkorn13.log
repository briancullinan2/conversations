[07/05/2007 08:17:56 PM] Brian Cullinan: 5k for purchase and installation of a new engine plus a 5 year 100 thousand mile warrenty
[07/05/2007 08:18:06 PM] Greg Miraglia: damn dude
[07/05/2007 08:18:21 PM] Brian Cullinan: so we are going to pretend its a new car because we can get 8 more years of drivers out of it
[07/05/2007 08:18:29 PM] Greg Miraglia: it might be better for you to just sell it for parts and buy something new
[07/05/2007 08:18:33 PM] Greg Miraglia: lol
[07/05/2007 08:18:37 PM] Greg Miraglia: well

[07/05/2007 08:18:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[07/05/2007 08:18:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but something was wrong with it
[07/05/2007 08:19:04 PM] Greg Miraglia: but sometimes shit happens
[07/05/2007 08:19:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: something that wasn't because it was a toyota, or anything we did
[07/05/2007 08:19:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: we took good fucking care of our cars

[07/05/2007 08:19:50 PM] Greg Miraglia: thats the problem with used cars
[07/05/2007 08:20:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah so it would cost us 5k to get another used car, or a new engine and we know exactly what is in it
[07/05/2007 08:20:20 PM] Greg Miraglia: some asshole who doesnt take care of it pawns it off on u and even with a 'carfax' something like that wont show up on it
