Session Start (bjcullinan:Micheal Brooks): Sat Jan 31 23:03:40 2009
[01/31/2009 11:03:40 PM] Micheal Brooks: Whats up man
[01/31/2009 11:32:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: hey, hows it going?
[01/31/2009 11:32:29 PM] Micheal Brooks: pretty good,  just rockin' some beer and writing code
[01/31/2009 11:32:32 PM] Micheal Brooks: whats up?
[01/31/2009 11:34:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: same here!
[01/31/2009 11:34:54 PM] Micheal Brooks: cool cool\
[01/31/2009 11:36:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: i bet there is a ton of alchol at your place
[01/31/2009 11:37:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i asked murphy this question, i have been working pretty hard on this project and am thinking about starting to port it to windows soon.  As a PHP programmer, how do i know when i am doing something wrong, how can i find someone to critique it like an essay, how do i know when it is ready to share with other people?
[01/31/2009 11:37:57 PM] Micheal Brooks: thats a good question
[01/31/2009 11:38:24 PM] Micheal Brooks: there is a lot of poor code out there,  but thats mostly because the programmer has not receive formal traning
[01/31/2009 11:38:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: i have tried to adapt techniques from other open projects like using DIR_SEP and dirname(__FILE__) to localize includes and stuff
[01/31/2009 11:39:09 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  thats good
[01/31/2009 11:39:34 PM] Micheal Brooks: includes can be a problem,  and i don't like it when an app forces you to be in the webroot
[01/31/2009 11:39:47 PM] Micheal Brooks: i make my apps so they can be moved around without causing problems
[01/31/2009 11:40:02 PM] Micheal Brooks: I can read over your code if you'd like
[01/31/2009 11:40:18 PM] Micheal Brooks: here is some code i have written:
[01/31/2009 11:40:19 PM] Micheal Brooks: (Link: http://code.google.com/p/michael-the-messenger/)http://code.google.com/p/michael-the-messenger/
[01/31/2009 11:40:22 PM] Micheal Brooks: its still work in progress
[01/31/2009 11:42:21 PM] Micheal Brooks: another thing is you have to worry about php configurations and checking for installed moduals
[01/31/2009 11:42:40 PM] Micheal Brooks: i have /compatablity.php for taking care of configs
[01/31/2009 11:42:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: and my install.php checks for needed moduals 
[01/31/2009 11:43:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes of course, install should check for modules, however i always provide the module with it then set up an obvious constant for changing the path, so if they wanted to use the global modules they can change the path and delete it from the includes directory
[01/31/2009 11:44:58 PM] Micheal Brooks: the moduals i am talking about are like php-mcrypt which is a binary that is platform specific
[01/31/2009 11:45:20 PM] Micheal Brooks: usually you'd use a package manager like PECL or PEAR under php,  but even APT will take care of it
[01/31/2009 11:46:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i always have constants set up for that kind of thing, so settings.php is the only place to have to define a required file, everywhere else just uses the constant
[01/31/2009 11:46:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: i think that works
[01/31/2009 11:47:22 PM] Micheal Brooks: if you want me to look over your code it would probably be best to do it in person
[01/31/2009 11:49:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah that would be great
[01/31/2009 11:49:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just found some security flaws i need to fix up
[01/31/2009 11:49:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: heh,  its all good man
[01/31/2009 11:49:47 PM] Micheal Brooks: its about learning
[01/31/2009 11:49:54 PM] Micheal Brooks: i have written flaws myself
[01/31/2009 11:50:47 PM] Micheal Brooks: i think of all code as being fundimentally insecure
[01/31/2009 11:51:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've really started to consider user input, and making sure i do enough validation
[01/31/2009 11:51:37 PM] Micheal Brooks: this is a fantastic paper:
 (Link: http://www.securereality.com.au/studyinscarlet.txt)http://www.securereality.com.au/studyinscarlet.txt
[01/31/2009 11:51:49 PM] Micheal Brooks: it talks about a lot of nasty taint/sink secuirty issues
[01/31/2009 11:52:17 PM] Micheal Brooks: taint is any input that comes from a user,  a Sink is a function that is senstive  like system(). 
[01/31/2009 11:52:28 PM] Micheal Brooks: if taint touches a sink,  then you have a vulnerablity 
[01/31/2009 11:53:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: and an std
[01/31/2009 11:54:01 PM] Micheal Brooks: hah,  yeah 
[01/31/2009 11:54:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: a sink is a database query
[01/31/2009 11:54:24 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  that is a sink
[01/31/2009 11:54:29 PM] Micheal Brooks: but so is print
[01/31/2009 11:54:33 PM] Micheal Brooks: becuase that could be xss
[01/31/2009 11:54:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: xss?
[01/31/2009 11:54:49 PM] Micheal Brooks: oah yeah you missed my talk
[01/31/2009 11:54:56 PM] Micheal Brooks: you let me down man
[01/31/2009 11:55:01 PM] Micheal Brooks: cross site scripting 
[01/31/2009 11:55:17 PM] Micheal Brooks: 
 <?php
 print $_GET[var];
 ?>
[01/31/2009 11:55:19 PM] Micheal Brooks: that is xss
[01/31/2009 11:56:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh
[01/31/2009 11:56:24 PM] Micheal Brooks: try it
[01/31/2009 11:56:35 PM] Micheal Brooks: the javascript will execute
[01/31/2009 11:57:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i'll just to a search for $_ and make sure there is validation before it
[01/31/2009 11:57:30 PM] Micheal Brooks: <?php
 print htmlspecialchars($_GET[var]);
 ?>
[01/31/2009 11:57:33 PM] Micheal Brooks: that is the fix for it
[01/31/2009 11:57:43 PM] Micheal Brooks: see what it does to the output,  view the page source
[01/31/2009 11:57:57 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[01/31/2009 11:57:59 PM] Micheal Brooks: xss has to deal with the Sam Orgin Polices which is gone into great depth here:

[01/31/2009 11:59:08 PM] Micheal Brooks: windows only
[01/31/2009 11:59:27 PM] Micheal Brooks: it is a scanner that is very good at testing your application for xss and sql injection
[01/31/2009 11:59:30 PM] Micheal Brooks: as well as other flaws
[02/01/2009 12:00:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm ok
[02/01/2009 12:00:18 AM] Micheal Brooks: i can show you how to use it,  but that would be better in person
[02/01/2009 12:01:30 AM] Brian Cullinan:      for($selected as $i => $value) if(!is_numeric($value)) unset($selected[$i];
 
[02/01/2009 12:01:47 AM] Micheal Brooks: whats wrong with numbers?
[02/01/2009 12:01:51 AM] Micheal Brooks: oah wait
[02/01/2009 12:01:53 AM] Micheal Brooks: if isn't numeric
[02/01/2009 12:02:06 AM] Brian Cullinan: can you break out of something that splits up by commas?
[02/01/2009 12:02:32 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  that could work,  or doing:
 for($selected as $i => $value) $selected[$i]=intval($selected[$i]);
[02/01/2009 12:02:51 AM] Micheal Brooks: i'm not sure what you are asking
[02/01/2009 12:02:57 AM] Micheal Brooks: i'd have to see a brick of code
[02/01/2009 12:04:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/01/2009 12:05:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't like intval, if it isn't numeric they are probably doing something wrong and don't deserve to get results back
[02/01/2009 12:05:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats all stuff the site does automatically
[02/01/2009 12:05:14 AM] Micheal Brooks: thats true
[02/01/2009 12:06:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: if it was intentionally meant for user input, then intval would be good, incase they accidentally hit like \ when they press enter
[02/01/2009 12:06:29 AM] Micheal Brooks: in most cases its better to throw stuff out than try and make it correct.  check out this query:
 "select * from user where id=".addlsahes($_GET[id])
[02/01/2009 12:06:42 AM] Micheal Brooks: that is still vulnerable to sql injection
[02/01/2009 12:07:53 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah mine was kind of like that
[02/01/2009 12:07:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: with the $selected thing
[02/01/2009 12:08:22 AM] Brian Cullinan: it was splitting it up by commas for a list of IDs, and then joining it with id=
[02/01/2009 12:08:33 AM] Micheal Brooks: ?id=1 or sleep(30)
[02/01/2009 12:09:17 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, but when i only used 1 id, i am finding i did have is_numeric validation
[02/01/2009 12:09:18 AM] Micheal Brooks: huh,  yeah dynamic queries like that can be a problem
[02/01/2009 12:09:34 AM] Micheal Brooks: cool
[02/01/2009 12:11:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: i hate when working with numeric arrays if you unset something the index is missing from the array
[02/01/2009 12:12:07 AM] Brian Cullinan: so a great fix for that, if you unset some stuff use $array = array_values($array);
[02/01/2009 12:12:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: then all the indexes will be sequential again
[02/01/2009 12:12:38 AM] Micheal Brooks: good to know

[02/01/2009 12:26:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: how to i allow for input like that?
[02/01/2009 12:26:44 AM] Brian Cullinan: addslashes?
[02/01/2009 12:27:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i want to allow for regular expression searching, but i don't want them to be able to get out of the query
[02/01/2009 12:27:45 AM] Micheal Brooks: wait,  addslashes is for protecting against sql injection,  it doesn't help for xss
[02/01/2009 12:28:18 AM] Micheal Brooks: go back to my one liner:
 <?php
 print $_GET[var];
 ?>
[02/01/2009 12:28:31 AM] Micheal Brooks: then try 
 <?php
 print htmlspeicalchars($_GET[var]);
 ?>
[02/01/2009 12:28:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: well i want to protect again sql injection
[02/01/2009 12:29:02 AM] Micheal Brooks: oah, okay
[02/01/2009 12:29:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: thats what i am using that request var for
[02/01/2009 12:29:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: so add slashes will work?
[02/01/2009 12:29:21 AM] Brian Cullinan: and still allow me to use a regular expression
[02/01/2009 12:29:52 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  it should work.  You have to make sure you don't do addslahes twice or the regex will break for sure. 
[02/01/2009 12:30:11 AM] Micheal Brooks: also if you have:
 magic_quotes_gpc=On and then you do a addslashes()
[02/01/2009 12:30:18 AM] Micheal Brooks: that could break it
[02/01/2009 12:30:48 AM] Micheal Brooks: i disable magic_qutoes_gpc and register_globals for my app
[02/01/2009 12:30:52 AM] Micheal Brooks: it causes too many problems
[02/01/2009 12:31:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[02/01/2009 12:32:44 AM] Micheal Brooks: think about it this way,  how do you print a double quote mark in java,  c or php?
[02/01/2009 12:32:58 AM] Micheal Brooks: you gotta do this:
 print "this quote\" mark is printed "
[02/01/2009 12:33:10 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[02/01/2009 12:33:12 AM] Micheal Brooks: you don't see the escape char,  so it shouldn't cause problems with your regex
[02/01/2009 12:33:31 AM] Micheal Brooks: but if you do 2 addslahes it will look like this:
 print "this quote\\\" mark is printed "
[02/01/2009 12:33:38 AM] Micheal Brooks: and that will fuck it up,  its still not sql injection
[02/01/2009 12:33:40 AM] Micheal Brooks: but its malformed
[02/01/2009 12:50:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: well that was fun
[02/01/2009 12:51:04 AM] Brian Cullinan: fixing up all my stuff

[02/09/2009 08:05:18 PM] Micheal Brooks: i burned off a dvd of some great trance/house for Rory,    you should bring your laptop to ACM on thursday so you can get a copy. 
[02/09/2009 08:05:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: ok!
[02/09/2009 08:05:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i am feeling like benny bennassi
[02/09/2009 08:06:14 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah his new album rock and rave is solid
[02/09/2009 08:06:18 PM] Micheal Brooks: i saw him at EDC last year
[02/09/2009 08:06:22 PM] Micheal Brooks: he has gotten better
[02/09/2009 08:06:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: awesoem
[02/09/2009 08:09:21 PM] Micheal Brooks: i have a live mix of him at a club that is sick
[02/09/2009 08:09:30 PM] Micheal Brooks: club fg
[02/09/2009 08:09:32 PM] Micheal Brooks: idk if you can find it
[02/09/2009 08:22:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: man this is the hardest i have ever worked on a website
[02/09/2009 08:22:51 PM] Micheal Brooks: what site?
[02/09/2009 08:23:47 PM] Micheal Brooks: Also you should try Mozilla Songbrid or Amarok for music management,  i have no idea how you use directories for your large collection
[02/09/2009 08:23:58 PM] Micheal Brooks: i tired finding stuff at the party and it was too hard
[02/09/2009 08:25:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is a search function on my site
[02/09/2009 08:26:08 PM] Micheal Brooks: metatag searching?
[02/09/2009 08:26:25 PM] Micheal Brooks: its all about metatags
[02/09/2009 08:26:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: or rather id3 tags for music
[02/09/2009 08:29:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: yes
[02/09/2009 08:29:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: and meta tags for images
[02/09/2009 08:29:40 PM] Micheal Brooks: nice
[02/09/2009 08:47:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: i am converting it to work without a database
[02/09/2009 08:47:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: making it optional
[02/09/2009 08:47:29 PM] Micheal Brooks: huh
[02/09/2009 08:47:31 PM] Brian Cullinan: so it only shows flat file structure
[02/09/2009 08:47:33 PM] Micheal Brooks: it will be much faster with a database
[02/09/2009 08:47:42 PM] Brian Cullinan: true story
[02/09/2009 08:47:59 PM] Brian Cullinan: but some people might not want to use it like that
[02/09/2009 08:48:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: so now it will be an option
[02/09/2009 08:48:19 PM] Micheal Brooks: cool
[02/09/2009 08:48:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you could use it just like microsoft live
[02/09/2009 08:48:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i should copy their template too

[02/16/2009 11:03:28 PM] Micheal Brooks: dude,  never use FTP
[02/16/2009 11:03:31 PM] Micheal Brooks: and move ssh to antoher port
[02/16/2009 11:03:32 PM] Micheal Brooks: asap
[02/16/2009 11:03:41 PM] Micheal Brooks: use SFTP
[02/16/2009 11:03:44 PM] Micheal Brooks: esp for code
[02/16/2009 11:03:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you just pwn our box?
[02/16/2009 11:03:53 PM] Micheal Brooks: i ran an nmap
[02/16/2009 11:03:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: pure-ftp supports sftp
[02/16/2009 11:04:13 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  sftp is over ssh
[02/16/2009 11:04:15 PM] Micheal Brooks: not ftp
[02/16/2009 11:04:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: and clint said moving to another port was a stupid idea
[02/16/2009 11:04:17 PM] Micheal Brooks: remove ftp
[02/16/2009 11:04:18 PM] Micheal Brooks: asap
[02/16/2009 11:04:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: pure-ftp support ftp over ssh i just have to set it up
[02/16/2009 11:05:03 PM] Micheal Brooks: (Link: http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=22)http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=22  vs (Link: http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=51239)http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=51239
[02/16/2009 11:05:11 PM] Micheal Brooks: clint has never hacked antyihng in his entire life
[02/16/2009 11:05:15 PM] Micheal Brooks: i have written more than 30 exploitis
[02/16/2009 11:05:25 PM] Brian Cullinan: that's not the point
[02/16/2009 11:05:49 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  what does clint say about throwing passwords and source code over the internet in clear text?
[02/16/2009 11:05:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: if they are able to get to get a log in we already have bigger problems
[02/16/2009 11:05:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: via ftp?
[02/16/2009 11:06:28 PM] Micheal Brooks: its a one line config file change and you drop your brute force attempts by a factor of 100,000
[02/16/2009 11:06:43 PM] Micheal Brooks: (Link: http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=21)http://isc.sans.org/port.html?port=21  spikes up to 140,0000
[02/16/2009 11:06:48 PM] Micheal Brooks: 140,000+
[02/16/2009 11:06:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: and the ftp service isn't accepting any logins because it isn't configured for users yet
[02/16/2009 11:06:57 PM] Micheal Brooks: remove it
[02/16/2009 11:07:03 PM] Micheal Brooks: use ssh
[02/16/2009 11:07:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[02/16/2009 11:07:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: you don't have to remove it to make it use sftp
[02/16/2009 11:07:40 PM] Brian Cullinan: and we use fail2ban which ruins brute force attacks
[02/16/2009 11:07:53 PM] Micheal Brooks: your making a major mistake
[02/16/2009 11:08:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: 6 login attemps and they are banned for 3 hours
[02/16/2009 11:08:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: if you can't plant something i will take your word for it, but so far there is nothing wrong
[02/16/2009 11:08:41 PM] Micheal Brooks: okay,  so if i have a botnet of 50,000 nodes i can guess the entire english dictionary in a few minutes
[02/16/2009 11:08:43 PM] Micheal Brooks: 3 hours?
[02/16/2009 11:08:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: so waht,  i have years to guess
[02/16/2009 11:09:28 PM] Micheal Brooks: ftp is a serious hazard,  use sftp
[02/16/2009 11:09:36 PM] Micheal Brooks: move ssh/sftp to a high port
[02/16/2009 11:09:40 PM] Micheal Brooks: its 2 config lines
[02/16/2009 11:09:46 PM] Micheal Brooks: and 1 command to remove sftp
[02/16/2009 11:09:55 PM] Micheal Brooks: if you won't i'll take a vote at acm
[02/16/2009 11:10:06 PM] Micheal Brooks: because your making a serious mistake
[02/16/2009 11:10:35 PM] Brian Cullinan: wow, that is really fucked up man
[02/16/2009 11:10:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: and kind of douchy
[02/16/2009 11:10:49 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  well  i use pico
[02/16/2009 11:10:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: you took a really bad approach to this entire conversation
[02/16/2009 11:11:03 PM] Micheal Brooks: okay i'm sorry
[02/16/2009 11:11:08 PM] Micheal Brooks: too much cafine
[02/16/2009 11:11:34 PM] Micheal Brooks: but are you really taking clint's word over mine?
[02/16/2009 11:11:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: maybe you should just chill and think about what you want to propose and we can talk about it later
[02/16/2009 11:12:05 PM] Micheal Brooks: okay,  i apologize 
[02/16/2009 11:13:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: leah takes a similar approach
[02/16/2009 11:14:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: she talks more like an attack, instead of a suggestion
[02/16/2009 11:14:18 PM] Micheal Brooks: also it looks like email is down
[02/16/2009 11:14:36 PM] Micheal Brooks: whatever man
[02/16/2009 11:14:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: i guess it doesn't matter at all
[02/16/2009 11:14:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: what email?

[02/16/2009 11:16:44 PM] Brian Cullinan: the mailing list hates Leah
[02/16/2009 11:16:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: whenever she sends something it sends out errors
[02/16/2009 11:21:12 PM] Micheal Brooks: but seriously ssh doubles as an sftp server
[02/16/2009 11:21:38 PM] Micheal Brooks: no point in having 2 servers with twice the likely hood of an exploit 
[02/16/2009 11:22:09 PM] Micheal Brooks: never mind the 250,000+  bots vs 10 bots scanning for you
[02/16/2009 11:23:13 PM] Brian Cullinan: sftp is an easier protocol, can i run in on localhost so when we use ssh we can use ftp
[02/16/2009 11:23:14 PM] Brian Cullinan: ?
[02/16/2009 11:23:36 PM] Micheal Brooks: idk
[02/16/2009 11:23:38 PM] Brian Cullinan: i didn't realize sftp can be used with the same services as ssh
[02/16/2009 11:23:46 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  its all good
[02/16/2009 11:24:01 PM] Micheal Brooks: no configs,  it just does it
[02/16/2009 11:24:24 PM] Brian Cullinan: i've used scp, and it is always a pain in the ass, typing in paths and doing a few files at a time, ftp is simple and i can use it with my web browser
[02/16/2009 11:24:48 PM] Micheal Brooks: i use Zend or Ubuntu's built in "server connection"
[02/16/2009 11:24:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: eclipse also works
[02/16/2009 11:25:10 PM] Micheal Brooks: i guess is gnome's "connect to server"
[02/16/2009 11:27:01 PM] Micheal Brooks: zend 5.5 is awesome for that.  6 also has  sftp but  6 has other problems...
[02/16/2009 11:28:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: i prefer an IDE that does more then just php
[02/16/2009 11:28:46 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah,  i rock eclipse for that reason
[02/16/2009 11:28:54 PM] Micheal Brooks: the python mod for eclipse works really well
[02/16/2009 11:29:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: i prefer an IDE that people haven't died waiting for it to load
[02/16/2009 11:29:28 PM] Micheal Brooks: so then what do you use
[02/16/2009 11:29:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: dreamweaver and visual studio
[02/16/2009 11:29:48 PM] Brian Cullinan: both load in under 15 seconds
[02/16/2009 11:29:54 PM] Brian Cullinan: both have remote file management
[02/16/2009 11:30:07 PM] Micheal Brooks: visual studio doesn't have very good text formatting,  like it doesn't match quote marks and ()
[02/16/2009 11:30:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: both support a wide variety of plugins and languages without compromising load times
[02/16/2009 11:30:36 PM] Micheal Brooks: dreamwaver has sftp for sure
[02/16/2009 11:31:12 PM] Brian Cullinan: uh huh :-]
[02/16/2009 11:31:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: and plenty of other protocols
[02/16/2009 11:31:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: so does VS
[02/16/2009 11:31:43 PM] Micheal Brooks: i don't like vs
[02/16/2009 11:31:50 PM] Micheal Brooks: unless i have to use it
[02/16/2009 11:31:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: VS doesn't run on java :-Z
[02/16/2009 11:32:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: java is slow an bloated
[02/16/2009 11:32:07 PM] Micheal Brooks: some stuff only builds on vs
[02/16/2009 11:32:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: so what does it make the languages you develop in it?
[02/16/2009 11:32:48 PM] Micheal Brooks: i use nano :p
[02/16/2009 11:32:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: VS is plenty hackable, you can copy shit out of the VS install and use them independently of VS
[02/16/2009 11:32:55 PM] Micheal Brooks: (oah god no,  nano blows for that shit)
[02/16/2009 11:33:17 PM] Micheal Brooks: can you get VS to match () , {} , '' and "" ?
[02/16/2009 11:33:20 PM] Micheal Brooks: becuase that was like wtf?
[02/16/2009 11:33:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: memory is another issue
[02/16/2009 11:33:30 PM] Micheal Brooks: so necessary 
[02/16/2009 11:33:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: what do you mean by match? if it is apart of the language then it will match it
[02/16/2009 11:33:56 PM] Micheal Brooks: like you put your curser over one and it finds the other for you
[02/16/2009 11:34:02 PM] Micheal Brooks: like the end of an if statement
[02/16/2009 11:34:11 PM] Brian Cullinan: eclipse usually gets bigger and bigger, i've had to restart it at 500 MB
[02/16/2009 11:34:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: vs always stays below 250
[02/16/2009 11:34:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh!
[02/16/2009 11:34:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: i totally love that feature
[02/16/2009 11:34:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: and yes i think there is a plugin for it
[02/16/2009 11:34:50 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah so do i
[02/16/2009 11:34:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: it saves time
[02/16/2009 11:35:07 PM] Micheal Brooks: i hope so
[02/16/2009 11:35:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: it's usefulness is more marginal when your parens are not all closed or there is the wrong number of opening, especially with languages that statements can span multiple lines
[02/16/2009 11:36:25 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah it doesn't matter for python
[02/16/2009 11:36:32 PM] Micheal Brooks: but for c/c++.  java. php
[02/16/2009 11:36:40 PM] Micheal Brooks: it really helps me
[02/16/2009 11:37:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm, i prefer 15 year old legacy code written in c over new java slow running code
[02/16/2009 11:37:12 PM] Micheal Brooks: i also like eclipse's feature to auto-format nasty code
[02/16/2009 11:37:24 PM] Micheal Brooks: like code written by cracked out indians that refuse to properly format their code
[02/16/2009 11:37:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah i hate that
[02/16/2009 11:38:37 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah its 2 clicks and it will format the code to a built in standard or you can make your own rules for formatting if your really anal like Dr Dan Li 
[02/16/2009 11:39:32 PM] Brian Cullinan: anal with Dan Li would be interesting
[02/16/2009 11:39:38 PM] Micheal Brooks: lol
[02/16/2009 11:39:52 PM] Micheal Brooks: she is like a 14 year old boy with a doctorate 
[02/16/2009 11:40:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: and a vagina
[02/16/2009 11:44:26 PM] Micheal Brooks: fuck i gotta wake up in 7 hours for server upgrades and the 2 sleeping pills i dropped more than an hour ago isn't doing shit
[02/16/2009 11:44:36 PM] Micheal Brooks: god damn your French press 
[02/16/2009 11:44:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: my*
[02/16/2009 11:47:23 PM] Brian Cullinan: better get to bed
[02/16/2009 11:47:32 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah

[04/12/2009 01:38:22 PM] Micheal Brooks: lol,  yeah i have never read that shit before
[04/12/2009 01:38:34 PM] Micheal Brooks: i just use the vuln browser that it comes with
[04/12/2009 01:38:45 PM] Micheal Brooks: download acuentix 6 and run it your self
[04/12/2009 01:38:51 PM] Micheal Brooks: its like type in a domain name,  hit enter
[04/12/2009 01:38:57 PM] Micheal Brooks: find vulns
[04/12/2009 01:39:29 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah not to mention it would be faster across the local network
[04/12/2009 01:39:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: i just saw your IP address and added deny from <ip> to my .htaccess
[04/12/2009 01:40:18 PM] Brian Cullinan: but you did help me find another vuln
[04/12/2009 01:40:30 PM] Brian Cullinan: word press doesn't protect the content folder
[04/12/2009 01:40:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so people could be linking to my site from any referer
[04/12/2009 01:41:08 PM] Brian Cullinan: i found some dumbass on a porn forum linking his avatar to my site

[04/12/2009 01:42:16 PM] Brian Cullinan: so i am thinking of how they could abuse my site
[04/12/2009 01:42:34 PM] Micheal Brooks: wordpress is really shitty code
[04/12/2009 01:42:39 PM] Micheal Brooks: a lot of vulns have been found in it
[04/12/2009 01:42:41 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah

[04/12/2009 03:18:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: sorry
[04/12/2009 03:18:36 PM] Brian Cullinan: if i had known i wouldn't have been freaking out about it
[04/12/2009 03:19:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: some of the stuff my site does it pretty cpu intensive
[04/12/2009 03:19:12 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah i don't really care,  i don' tthink anything will ahppen
[04/12/2009 03:19:16 PM] Micheal Brooks: shit happens
[04/12/2009 03:19:25 PM] Micheal Brooks: sorry for freakin' ya out
[04/12/2009 03:19:33 PM] Brian Cullinan: so when i got 10 connections open at a time and threads are constantly being killed and started it is pretty intense
[04/12/2009 03:19:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: nah, it was good practice
[04/12/2009 03:19:49 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah
[04/12/2009 03:20:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: i need to put something in place to only allow a certain number of requests
[04/12/2009 03:20:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: like you can only make a request every second on my media site
[04/12/2009 03:24:04 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways, i meant to IM you and tell you that all these little errors are in the template
[04/12/2009 03:24:58 PM] Brian Cullinan: all the internal stuff is pretty stable
[04/12/2009 03:25:43 PM] Micheal Brooks: cool
[04/12/2009 03:26:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: anyways i might write templates in php from now on
[04/12/2009 03:26:51 PM] Brian Cullinan: this smarty stuff is a pain

[04/12/2009 03:47:42 PM] Micheal Brooks: yo
[04/12/2009 03:48:07 PM] Micheal Brooks: make sure you can accept incoming connections or it will be very slow
[04/12/2009 04:05:27 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do i make it skip the search field
[04/12/2009 04:30:02 PM] Brian Cullinan: i think i'll add a PREVENT_OVERLOADING options that requires a second delay between requests, and doesn't run the cron script if a ton of other stuff is running
[04/12/2009 04:35:53 PM] Brian Cullinan: how do i edit the request variables to test?
[04/12/2009 04:36:01 PM] Brian Cullinan: i want to to always use the live template
[04/12/2009 04:59:10 PM] Micheal Brooks: i'm not sure what you are asking
[04/12/2009 05:00:00 PM] Micheal Brooks: also mysql can show you heavy queries that are currently running,  and i used this to track down some search engine cron script,  i set it to only run at midnight when there wasn't much load on the server
[04/12/2009 05:00:17 PM] Micheal Brooks: cacti can give you a nice graph of resource usage
[04/12/2009 05:00:58 PM] Micheal Brooks: your cron idea is good
[04/12/2009 05:26:20 PM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, it really makes the site virtually unhackable, i mean making cron only act on things internally, and making the admin section the only place that accepts input, it really abstracts everything in to a model, view, controller paradigm

[04/27/2009 08:41:22 PM] Micheal Brooks: the project looks like its still active,  but i'm not sure
[04/27/2009 08:41:57 PM] Micheal Brooks: libTorrent is the best multi-platform c++ library for bittorrent,  a lot of great clients are based on it. 
[04/27/2009 08:42:09 PM] Brian Cullinan: ah

[04/27/2009 08:44:17 PM] Brian Cullinan: because they are the only ones who would like that stupid view
[04/27/2009 08:44:45 PM] Brian Cullinan: its difficult for us to use because it doesn't show the information we care about
[04/27/2009 08:44:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: they over complicated it

[05/12/2009 12:48:36 AM] Brian Cullinan: aol is a sell out is all i mean
[05/12/2009 12:51:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: the only reason i ask is because people talk, and i hear stuff, and it hasn't affected my feelings towards living with you, i just want to get to know you better
[05/12/2009 12:52:27 AM] Micheal Brooks: i'll tell you about some of the stuff i've done in real life
[05/12/2009 12:52:37 AM] Micheal Brooks: not over the net,  unless you grab some encryption
[05/12/2009 12:52:48 AM] *** bjcullinan wants to directly connect.
[05/12/2009 12:52:58 AM] Micheal Brooks: not quite
[05/12/2009 12:53:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol
[05/12/2009 12:53:02 AM] Micheal Brooks: you need pidigin-encryption
[05/12/2009 12:53:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm don't have pigin, but you could call me
[05/12/2009 12:54:16 AM] Micheal Brooks: naa,  i'd rather use encryption 
[05/12/2009 12:54:18 AM] Micheal Brooks: or in person
[05/12/2009 12:54:24 AM] Micheal Brooks: but,  it doesn't matter that shit is behind me
[05/12/2009 12:54:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, we can wait to talk in person, i am interested in knowing you better

[05/12/2009 12:57:57 AM] Brian Cullinan: dude have you never seen veronica mars?
[05/12/2009 12:58:13 AM] Micheal Brooks: i don't think so

[05/12/2009 01:00:20 AM] Micheal Brooks: like 3.14, haha?
[05/12/2009 01:01:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: private investigator
[05/12/2009 01:02:13 AM] Micheal Brooks: oah aha

[05/12/2009 01:04:37 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah she is
[05/12/2009 01:04:38 AM] Micheal Brooks: brb
[05/12/2009 01:09:24 AM] Brian Cullinan: made progress on the clock today
[05/12/2009 01:12:26 AM] Micheal Brooks: sweet
[05/12/2009 01:12:30 AM] Micheal Brooks: that thing is more than a clock
[05/12/2009 01:13:03 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm
[05/12/2009 01:13:19 AM] Brian Cullinan: you will have to help me come up with creative stuff to do
[05/12/2009 01:13:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: and it spins twice as fast as the human fucking eye
[05/12/2009 01:13:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: we think were so amazing, but the eye only refreshes as 60 hz
[05/12/2009 01:14:04 AM] Micheal Brooks: it would be fun to write patters for it
[05/12/2009 01:14:06 AM] Micheal Brooks: or sink it up to music
[05/12/2009 01:14:50 AM] Brian Cullinan: i agree
[05/12/2009 01:16:09 AM] Brian Cullinan: actually music would be fucking awesome
[05/12/2009 01:17:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: we could come up with a circuit for turning frequencies of the analog signal into digital and change colors
[05/12/2009 01:18:12 AM] Micheal Brooks: that would be cool,  i don't know much about A2D stuff
[05/12/2009 01:18:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: well our circuit would make it basically digital before it even gets to the chip, and it doesn't have to be perfect because it will be changing a lot
[05/12/2009 01:20:16 AM] Micheal Brooks: also encasing it in plastic to make it more portable and less fragile would be a good thing to do 
[05/12/2009 01:21:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah for sure
[05/12/2009 01:32:27 AM] Micheal Brooks: this girl is amazing:

[05/12/2009 01:38:11 AM] Micheal Brooks: i think its looking at the rate of change of the music
[05/12/2009 01:38:35 AM] Micheal Brooks: the first derivative of the beat 
[05/12/2009 01:39:35 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Pictures/200)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Pictures/2008-08-05%20Crystal%20(Very%20Sexy!)/DSC01585.JPG

[05/12/2009 01:40:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: we will definitely have to come up with something creative to do with sound
[05/12/2009 01:40:26 AM] Brian Cullinan: she sent those to you too!?
[05/12/2009 01:40:36 AM] Micheal Brooks: no,  meg showed them to me
[05/12/2009 01:40:46 AM] Brian Cullinan: she send them to meg too!?
[05/12/2009 01:40:53 AM] Micheal Brooks: hah,  idk how meg got them
[05/12/2009 01:41:05 AM] Brian Cullinan: maybe online
[05/12/2009 01:41:10 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah they where online
[05/12/2009 01:41:20 AM] Brian Cullinan: i don't really care, just thought she was secretive/insecure about them
[05/12/2009 01:42:01 AM] Brian Cullinan: (Link: http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Pictures/200)http://209.250.30.30/Share/Pictures/Pictures/2008-08-05%20Crystal%20(Very%20Sexy!)/DSC01594.JPG
[05/12/2009 01:42:05 AM] Micheal Brooks: thats crazy, but hot girls are crazy
[05/12/2009 01:42:28 AM] Brian Cullinan: ya
[05/12/2009 01:44:07 AM] Micheal Brooks: brb
[05/12/2009 02:02:56 AM] Micheal Brooks: back
[05/12/2009 02:04:41 AM] Brian Cullinan: anyways i am working on the project
[05/12/2009 02:04:45 AM] Brian Cullinan: in the acm room
[05/12/2009 02:04:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: and leah and people are working on the robot
[05/12/2009 02:05:16 AM] Brian Cullinan: i would invite you to come join us but leah doesn't like you too much
[05/12/2009 02:05:32 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah i know
[05/12/2009 02:05:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: so as soon as i get to LEDs we should start programming the drive together
[05/12/2009 02:05:37 AM] Micheal Brooks: she has reasons too
[05/12/2009 02:05:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: and david smith said he had like 6 he could give us to do the same thing
[05/12/2009 02:05:58 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah, she told me
[05/12/2009 02:06:37 AM] Micheal Brooks: now i'm curious what she said
[05/12/2009 02:06:44 AM] Micheal Brooks: what about dave smith?
[05/12/2009 02:07:12 AM] Brian Cullinan: he's going to give me more drives to mod/destroy/make pretty
[05/12/2009 02:07:21 AM] Micheal Brooks: bad ass
[05/12/2009 02:07:59 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah he said he had like six that were clicking of death or rw errors
[05/12/2009 02:08:14 AM] Micheal Brooks: nice
[05/12/2009 02:08:27 AM] Micheal Brooks: the click of death might be a problem, i think they won't spin up
[05/12/2009 02:08:36 AM] Micheal Brooks: i have had drives die to that
[05/12/2009 02:08:48 AM] Brian Cullinan: i think click of death is from the reader
[05/12/2009 02:09:02 AM] Micheal Brooks: huh
[05/12/2009 02:09:09 AM] Micheal Brooks:  how you fix it is you put them is you put them in a static bag or wrap them in alumium foil and put them in the freezer for a few hours
[05/12/2009 02:09:19 AM] Micheal Brooks: and its enough for the drive to spin up once
[05/12/2009 02:09:22 AM] Micheal Brooks: and pull you data off
[05/12/2009 02:09:26 AM] Micheal Brooks: i shit you not
[05/12/2009 02:09:29 AM] Micheal Brooks: i have done this
[05/12/2009 02:09:42 AM] Micheal Brooks: i fucking cried that i lost my data,  and i googled it and i found this solution 
[05/12/2009 02:09:55 AM] Brian Cullinan: lol yeah i heard that one too
[05/12/2009 02:10:00 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tried it once and it didn't work
[05/12/2009 02:10:17 AM] Micheal Brooks: another thing you can try is softly taping the side of the drive 
[05/12/2009 02:10:25 AM] Micheal Brooks: a rubber mallot works well
[05/12/2009 02:10:37 AM] Brian Cullinan: but i may have spun it up a couple times, so if i did it the first time maybe it would work
[05/12/2009 02:10:50 AM] Micheal Brooks: yeah maybe
[05/12/2009 02:12:13 AM] Brian Cullinan: anyways
[05/12/2009 02:12:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i tore about 2 different manufacturer's drives and the platters were the exact same size
[05/12/2009 02:13:02 AM] Brian Cullinan: so we can at least use them for spares and make tons more
[05/12/2009 02:13:15 AM] Brian Cullinan: of clocks
[05/12/2009 02:13:25 AM] Brian Cullinan: and sell them to faculty for 100 buckas
[05/12/2009 02:13:29 AM] Brian Cullinan: *bucks
[05/12/2009 02:13:33 AM] Micheal Brooks: very cool,  when does the other components come in?
[05/12/2009 02:13:44 AM] Micheal Brooks: also, it looks like you need some really fine soldering
[05/12/2009 02:14:05 AM] Micheal Brooks: idk if i am that good with a soldering iron,  but i'll take a stab at it for sure.
[05/12/2009 02:14:34 AM] Brian Cullinan: hmm shouldn't need to much soldering but definitely a little, and you are welcome to help
[05/12/2009 02:14:49 AM] Brian Cullinan: i am getting a LED strip the 15th
[05/12/2009 02:14:56 AM] Brian Cullinan: 30 bucks including shipping
[05/12/2009 02:15:23 AM] Micheal Brooks: for 1?
[05/12/2009 02:15:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: yeah
[05/12/2009 02:15:39 AM] Micheal Brooks: damn

[05/12/2009 02:41:32 AM] Brian Cullinan: how about flashy colors that are aware of their surroundings and direction
[05/12/2009 02:41:45 AM] Micheal Brooks: i agree that rave toys need to be smarter
[05/12/2009 02:41:54 AM] Brian Cullinan: way smarter

[05/12/2009 02:43:19 AM] Micheal Brooks: mdma must be done at least once in your life
[05/12/2009 02:43:40 AM] Brian Cullinan: i figure if my dad does cocaine i should try it once and see what i am missing
[05/12/2009 02:43:51 AM] Brian Cullinan: i wouldn't do meth or haroine
[05/12/2009 02:43:58 AM] Micheal Brooks: defintly don't do thoughs

[06/25/2009 11:33:33 AM] Brian Cullinan: i guess i could always get flacs for that kind of stuff, but i don't know if i could convert my entire library

[07/13/2009 04:26:58 PM] Micheal Brooks: can i borrow one of the 1tb drives?
[07/13/2009 04:27:31 PM] Micheal Brooks: Also,  i just cleaned up the place for tomorrow,  its looks nice.   Everytime you leave its going to be cleaner.
[07/13/2009 04:30:43 PM] Brian Cullinan: hahaha yeah
[07/13/2009 04:30:49 PM] Brian Cullinan: having trouble copying?
[07/13/2009 04:31:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: ohhhh must be the quota management
[07/13/2009 04:31:19 PM] Brian Cullinan: there is only 161 GB left, do you need more then that?
[07/13/2009 04:31:35 PM] Micheal Brooks: or it might gnome's samba bullshit...  it doesn't support resume
[07/13/2009 04:31:50 PM] Micheal Brooks: well, i saw a 1tb drive on your desk,  i was wondering if i could just format it and copy using sftp+filezilla 
[07/13/2009 04:31:52 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[07/13/2009 04:32:07 PM] Micheal Brooks: it has a aweosme resume feature,  you can replace files of a differnt size or differnt creation date
[07/13/2009 04:32:34 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmm interesting
[07/13/2009 04:32:47 PM] Brian Cullinan: so you wouldn't need my computer if you used the 1TB on my desk
[07/13/2009 04:32:51 PM] Micheal Brooks: yea
[07/13/2009 04:33:09 PM] Micheal Brooks: you can still get a copy of my warez,  i'll figure somthing out
[07/13/2009 04:33:28 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can change the quota settings if you need less then 161GB
[07/13/2009 04:34:34 PM] Micheal Brooks: hmm,  yea i its not good.  it said the transfer was complete but it copied like 1/2 of it after like 2 days of transferring at 1mbyte/s
[07/13/2009 04:34:39 PM] Micheal Brooks: i think gnome fucked up
[07/13/2009 04:36:03 PM] Brian Cullinan: hmmm
[07/13/2009 04:36:05 PM] Brian Cullinan: shitty
[07/13/2009 04:36:15 PM] Brian Cullinan: i guess the 1TB drive is the only other option then
[07/13/2009 04:36:29 PM] Micheal Brooks: it would make things easier
[07/13/2009 04:37:46 PM] Brian Cullinan: oh, my quota manager is set to warning
[07/13/2009 04:37:50 PM] Brian Cullinan: so that isn't the problem
[07/13/2009 05:03:26 PM] Brian Cullinan: i can reserve your routers mac address to make it easier to get to in switch mode
[07/13/2009 05:03:55 PM] Brian Cullinan: did you copy over the OS X VM?
[07/13/2009 05:03:59 PM] Micheal Brooks: yeah
[07/13/2009 05:04:04 PM] Micheal Brooks: what is the password for the router?
[07/13/2009 05:04:10 PM] Micheal Brooks: so i can setup some port fowarding

[07/13/2009 05:49:07 PM] Brian Cullinan: sure is taking a while to boot up
[07/13/2009 05:49:37 PM] Brian Cullinan: guess it could be the hardware change

[07/13/2009 05:50:53 PM] Micheal Brooks: you can ssh into it and you get a root shell,  it looks like a linux box
