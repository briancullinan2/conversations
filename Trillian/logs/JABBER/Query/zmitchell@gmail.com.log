[05/23/2007 04:03:24 PM] Zach MItchell: meh
[05/23/2007 04:03:25 PM] Zach MItchell: gay
[05/23/2007 04:03:29 PM] bjcullinan: then i will get WD
[05/23/2007 04:03:37 PM] bjcullinan: i need to put them in seperate raids
[05/23/2007 04:03:47 PM] bjcullinan: mix them up and not order them all at the same time
[05/23/2007 04:04:04 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i will get 2 seagates and 2 more WB

[05/23/2007 04:05:10 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i think i will do that
[05/23/2007 04:05:34 PM] bjcullinan: now the last question is, where can i find a cheap small drive to store OSes on?
[05/23/2007 04:06:43 PM] Zach MItchell: haha its to the point where you might as well just buy a big drive
[05/23/2007 04:06:46 PM] Zach MItchell: cause its cheaper
[05/23/2007 04:06:57 PM] Zach MItchell: you still have to pay for the amount of material in manufacturing a hard drive
[05/23/2007 04:07:07 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, maybe i'll just put OSes on the WD drives
[05/23/2007 04:07:11 PM] Zach MItchell: 40 gb hds are only like 15$ cheaper then a 300gb
[05/23/2007 04:07:18 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[05/23/2007 04:07:36 PM] bjcullinan: i understand why my drives died
[05/23/2007 04:07:58 PM] bjcullinan: i read and write on entire drives in 1 month as normal people do in a year
[05/23/2007 04:08:30 PM] bjcullinan: i store like 300 GB Vmware images, and move them around when i need to consolidate space
[05/23/2007 04:08:31 PM] Zach MItchell: but why?
[05/23/2007 04:08:49 PM] Zach MItchell: my media server does that, just because of how tv works
[05/23/2007 04:08:54 PM] Zach MItchell: but i use scsi hard drives for that
[05/23/2007 04:08:58 PM] Zach MItchell: cause they can handle it better
[05/23/2007 04:09:01 PM] bjcullinan: and for 2 weeks i did nothing but copy hundreds of 4 gb movies across the network onto the drives
[05/23/2007 04:09:13 PM] Zach MItchell: meh
[05/23/2007 04:09:22 PM] bjcullinan: so i think thats why they failed so quick
[05/23/2007 04:09:27 PM] Zach MItchell: those drives would have been under manufacturer warranty then
[05/23/2007 04:09:33 PM] bjcullinan: yes they were
[05/23/2007 04:09:38 PM] bjcullinan: but i returned them
[05/23/2007 04:09:45 PM] bjcullinan: for the ES series
