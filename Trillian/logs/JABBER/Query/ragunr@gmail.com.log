[10/30/2007 05:18:44 PM] Richard Lester: I was having some trouble attempting to ssh into the server you set up for me.  I was wondering if any of that was set up already? (Ive been meaning to get things running for a while, got super busy)
[10/30/2007 05:19:02 PM] bjcullinan: try ssh again
[10/30/2007 05:19:51 PM] bjcullinan: you have access via vmware console also

[10/30/2007 05:24:48 PM] Richard Lester: oh yeah
[10/30/2007 05:24:56 PM] Richard Lester: also, I was wondering about how the ports are set up
[10/30/2007 05:25:35 PM] Richard Lester: i noticed im 62902, which was different then the... 62115? you told me earlier?
[10/30/2007 05:26:18 PM] bjcullinan: the ssh port is 62105
[10/30/2007 05:27:00 PM] Richard Lester: still no luck, but thats good to know
[10/30/2007 05:27:06 PM] bjcullinan: but i can't get in
[10/30/2007 05:27:11 PM] bjcullinan: locally
[10/30/2007 05:27:16 PM] bjcullinan: and the machine is on
[10/30/2007 05:27:20 PM] Richard Lester: that would be a problem
[10/30/2007 05:27:32 PM] Richard Lester: firewall killing us?
[10/30/2007 05:27:51 PM] bjcullinan: no firewall

[10/30/2007 05:29:42 PM] Richard Lester: does it not have ssh installed?
[10/30/2007 05:30:19 PM] Richard Lester: or.. we were doing it the other day
[10/30/2007 05:30:21 PM] bjcullinan: i thought it was
[10/30/2007 05:30:28 PM] Richard Lester: you just copied the disk image right?
[10/30/2007 05:30:35 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[10/30/2007 05:30:42 PM] bjcullinan: you will have to log on through VMware and check things like IP address
[10/30/2007 05:30:51 PM] Richard Lester: I guess so
[10/30/2007 05:31:05 PM] Richard Lester: maybe one of those configuration files had something specific to that machine
[10/30/2007 05:31:10 PM] Richard Lester: ok
[10/30/2007 05:34:31 PM] bjcullinan: i think it might have something to do with IP address
[10/30/2007 05:35:00 PM] bjcullinan: i rebuilt the config thogh, i just copied the harddrive over
[10/30/2007 05:35:39 PM] Richard Lester: right
[10/30/2007 05:35:45 PM] Richard Lester: yeah I was kind of thinking of that
[10/30/2007 05:36:01 PM] Richard Lester: I wish I had enough room to install VmWare on this machine
[10/30/2007 05:36:27 PM] bjcullinan: it's not very big
[10/30/2007 05:37:18 PM] Richard Lester: yeah but im in the engineering building

[10/30/2007 10:55:53 PM] bjcullinan: i am not so sure
[10/30/2007 10:56:04 PM] Richard Lester: why do you say that
[10/30/2007 10:56:49 PM] bjcullinan: because i have genuinely needed help in the past and he did that misdirection thing he always does 
[10/30/2007 10:57:25 PM] Richard Lester: that misdirection thing?
[10/30/2007 10:58:35 PM] bjcullinan: where he bullshits me
[10/30/2007 10:59:43 PM] Richard Lester: hmm
[10/30/2007 11:03:38 PM] Richard Lester: yay. SSH is working for me (kept forgetting to change the port, i must be out of it tonight)
[10/30/2007 11:03:52 PM] bjcullinan: save the config
[10/30/2007 11:05:15 PM] Richard Lester: you mean in putty?

[10/30/2007 11:05:23 PM] bjcullinan: yes in putty
[10/30/2007 11:05:25 PM] Richard Lester: hehe
[10/30/2007 11:05:49 PM] Richard Lester: is there any place I can set the dhclient to run on startup?
[10/30/2007 11:06:17 PM] bjcullinan: it doesn't have too
[10/30/2007 11:06:32 PM] bjcullinan: it just started the machine before the internet connection was set up
[10/30/2007 11:06:33 PM] Richard Lester: what if the server has to reset?
[10/30/2007 11:06:41 PM] Richard Lester: ah
[10/30/2007 11:06:43 PM] bjcullinan: that is weird, i did restart it
[10/30/2007 11:06:49 PM] bjcullinan: it should have been alright then
[10/30/2007 11:07:00 PM] bjcullinan: we will see if dhclient needs to be run again
[10/30/2007 11:07:13 PM] bjcullinan: if it is really a problem we can take care of it next time
[10/30/2007 11:07:46 PM] Richard Lester: ok

[10/30/2007 11:08:16 PM] bjcullinan: google it
[10/30/2007 11:12:16 PM] Richard Lester: yay
[10/30/2007 11:16:23 PM] Richard Lester: ug. why is my internet being so slow? lag on a command prompt is painful
[10/30/2007 11:16:35 PM] bjcullinan: ahahaha i am torrenting
[10/30/2007 11:16:43 PM] Richard Lester: lol
[10/30/2007 11:16:45 PM] Richard Lester: so painful
[10/30/2007 11:16:51 PM] bjcullinan: but it's even torrenting slow, it can't be using all the bandwidth
[10/30/2007 11:17:04 PM] bjcullinan: so its probably a combination of both of our shitty internet
[10/30/2007 11:17:17 PM] Richard Lester: probably
[10/30/2007 11:17:27 PM] bjcullinan: i wish it would torrent faster
[10/30/2007 11:17:42 PM] bjcullinan: 16 minutes to wait for 152 MB
[10/30/2007 11:17:45 PM] Richard Lester: I wish I had OMG ponies
[10/30/2007 11:17:46 PM] bjcullinan: ridiculous
[10/30/2007 11:17:59 PM] bjcullinan: ponies? where? omg

[10/30/2007 11:18:14 PM] bjcullinan: a 30 minute wait?
[10/30/2007 11:18:15 PM] Richard Lester: it was all of a 5 second wait at the engineering building (not that I could install it there)
[10/30/2007 11:18:24 PM] Richard Lester: same size
[10/30/2007 11:18:32 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[10/30/2007 11:18:41 PM] bjcullinan: the console is really small
[10/30/2007 11:18:53 PM] bjcullinan: you sure you installed the right thing?
[10/30/2007 11:19:02 PM] Richard Lester: I think I may have gotten the whole managment tool too

[02/03/2008 05:25:54 PM] bjcullinan: so it would be hypotenuse is equal to the speed of gravity divided by sin(45)?

[02/03/2008 05:35:16 PM] Richard Lester: In all honesty you could probably just make up a constant for the acceleration.
[02/03/2008 05:35:55 PM] bjcullinan: bleh
[02/03/2008 05:36:01 PM] Richard Lester: it would look good

[02/03/2008 05:44:45 PM] bjcullinan: the answer to what?
[02/03/2008 05:44:58 PM] bjcullinan: the equation?
[02/03/2008 05:45:11 PM] Richard Lester: the accelation due to rolling

[02/03/2008 05:45:30 PM] bjcullinan: if i had chosen randomly that would probably be the number i picked

[03/23/2008 11:18:00 AM] bjcullinan: so we can't even talk about how we solved certain problems?
[03/23/2008 11:18:39 AM] Richard Lester: I think that just means that we cant work in groups
[03/23/2008 11:18:54 AM] Richard Lester: considering out homework is how we are learning alot of the time, it makes no sense to isolate us
[03/23/2008 11:19:13 AM] Richard Lester: *our
[03/23/2008 11:19:19 AM] Richard Lester: and yes, I did start it
[03/23/2008 11:19:56 AM] Richard Lester: oh, and do you know when our VW project v. 2 is due?
[03/23/2008 11:21:19 AM] *** Richard Lester went away at Sun Mar 23 11:21:19 2008.
[03/23/2008 11:21:36 AM] Richard Lester: that was strange, my firefox crashed

[03/23/2008 11:22:09 AM] bjcullinan: he just wants more game like play
[03/23/2008 11:22:35 AM] Richard Lester: yeah, too bad though, I was hoping to put more time into it
[03/23/2008 11:22:49 AM] Richard Lester: I guess thats what Ill be doing tomarow
[03/23/2008 11:27:19 AM] bjcullinan: have you seen the HP travel companion
[03/23/2008 11:27:23 AM] bjcullinan: it looks pretty
[03/23/2008 11:27:33 AM] Richard Lester: no, I havnt
[03/23/2008 11:27:34 AM] bjcullinan: it's like a handheld navigation system
[03/23/2008 11:27:44 AM] Richard Lester: GPS type thing?
[03/23/2008 11:27:45 AM] bjcullinan: touch screen and everything
[03/23/2008 11:27:54 AM] bjcullinan: but it's really pretty

[03/23/2008 11:28:26 AM] Richard Lester: You will have to show me when we are in the ACM room tomarow
[03/23/2008 11:32:27 AM] bjcullinan: i think i finally have my mediaserver database working the way i want
[03/23/2008 11:32:44 AM] Richard Lester: and the villagers rejoiced
[03/23/2008 11:32:57 AM] bjcullinan: yeah they do
[03/23/2008 11:33:02 AM] Richard Lester: lol
[03/23/2008 11:34:33 AM] bjcullinan: i programmed it so i could run the script every 30 minutes or so, and it will run for like 30 seconds, and update the database of media
[03/23/2008 11:34:49 AM] Richard Lester: woot
[03/23/2008 11:35:40 AM] bjcullinan: the problem was it can't loop through all of my music folders in 30 seconds, so i save the paths that it is currently working on, and it picks up where it left off, so it will eventually cycle through all the folders then start over
[03/23/2008 11:36:45 AM] Richard Lester: aha
[03/23/2008 11:36:58 AM] Richard Lester: how long would It take to run though all of them in one shot?
[03/23/2008 11:38:42 AM] bjcullinan: like 20 minutes and it will crash my server from too much memory usage
[03/23/2008 11:39:20 AM] Richard Lester: lol
[03/23/2008 11:39:34 AM] bjcullinan: php doesn't do much garbage collection
[03/23/2008 11:39:38 AM] Richard Lester: sounds like a memory leak
[03/23/2008 11:41:04 AM] bjcullinan: yeah it's totally my fault
[03/23/2008 11:41:33 AM] Richard Lester: lol
[03/23/2008 11:41:51 AM] Richard Lester: well, that works though
[03/23/2008 11:44:22 AM] bjcullinan: yeah it should work pretty well, i have a bunch of error checking and it removed old data and everything
[03/23/2008 11:56:22 AM] bjcullinan: i am hungry
