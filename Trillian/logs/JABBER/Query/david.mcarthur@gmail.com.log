[08/17/2007 04:44:28 PM] David McArthur: is that important?
[08/17/2007 04:45:11 PM] bjcullinan: its basically just a file copying program, not ecrypted or anything (yet), but you will be able to get other peoples database of programs
[08/17/2007 04:47:11 PM] bjcullinan: the best things it has other other programs, it will be able to export a database of files information to cvs, with like name and then key, it will be able to compare collections of files, so i can compare music with my friend and see what i need to copy to my collection when he gets to stuff, and i can copy files that i need to burn for people with the click of a button

[08/17/2007 04:50:07 PM] bjcullinan: it just need to transfer text describing files that a person has, theres no way for someone to actually use that against them because it would all be circumstantial evidence
