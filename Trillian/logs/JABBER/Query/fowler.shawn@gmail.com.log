[06/30/2009 03:38:24 PM] bjcullinan: is there a CSS class that you want me to use for highlighting stuff?
[06/30/2009 03:38:36 PM] bjcullinan: like a different color that goes with the templates
[06/30/2009 03:38:40 PM] bjcullinan: maybe bold
[06/30/2009 03:38:43 PM] bjcullinan: something in-line

[07/02/2009 11:51:22 AM] bjcullinan: Hey
[07/02/2009 11:51:53 AM] bjcullinan: so, did you want to use those files names for the IT section that you uploaded and are blank, because i already have all the stuff in files with shorter names.
[07/02/2009 11:52:08 AM] bjcullinan: we should get the SVN working so we can do a checkout before we start working on it
[07/02/2009 11:54:51 AM] bjcullinan: i'll just work on the design for practice site
[07/02/2009 11:55:27 AM] Shawn Fowler: ok
[07/02/2009 11:55:42 AM] Shawn Fowler: ill have to look at the file names
[07/02/2009 11:55:48 AM] Shawn Fowler: ive forgotten what i put
[07/02/2009 11:56:44 AM] Shawn Fowler: i like the long name better and that is what has been used throughout the rest of the site.
[07/02/2009 12:05:52 PM] bjcullinan: ah
[07/02/2009 12:06:03 PM] bjcullinan: ok, i just figured shorter names would be easier to link through
[07/02/2009 12:09:45 PM] bjcullinan: you haven't been working on the design4practice stuff right?
[07/02/2009 12:11:34 PM] Shawn Fowler: nope, it hurts my brain to just look at the site
[07/02/2009 12:14:54 PM] bjcullinan: lol yeah, it says copyright 1996 (and it hasn't been redesigned since)
[07/02/2009 12:19:01 PM] Shawn Fowler: i didnt notice the 1996 copyright :)
[07/02/2009 12:45:20 PM] bjcullinan: oh god
[07/02/2009 12:45:25 PM] bjcullinan: they are using an image map
[07/02/2009 12:45:31 PM] bjcullinan: that i haven't seen since the 90s
[07/02/2009 12:45:38 PM] bjcullinan: this site makes me cry
[07/02/2009 12:58:07 PM] Shawn Fowler: it is really bad
[07/02/2009 12:58:22 PM] Shawn Fowler: a lot of the content could also probably be dropped
[07/02/2009 01:15:07 PM] Shawn Fowler: by the way, put the D4P stuff in the Research folder as a sub folder
[07/02/2009 01:45:18 PM] bjcullinan: ok
