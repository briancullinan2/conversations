[02/29/2008 10:35:48 AM] LordshipDoom: They tell me that there is ink in the 232 cabinet. Did you find it?
[02/29/2008 10:36:23 AM] bjcullinan: There is ink for the small color printer in that room correct
[02/29/2008 10:36:35 AM] bjcullinan: the large one takes a big black cartrige
[02/29/2008 10:36:58 AM] LordshipDoom: Clint said one was in there.
[02/29/2008 10:39:40 AM] bjcullinan: i have looked twice and i don't see a box any larger than the tiny ones
[02/29/2008 10:39:56 AM] LordshipDoom: Just a sec. I'll ask again.
[02/29/2008 10:40:03 AM] bjcullinan: i saw cartriges, and read the labels on them, they were for the color deskjet that is in that room
[02/29/2008 10:41:03 AM] bjcullinan: it is quite clearly a large cartridge like the ones i replace all the time in the lounge, i saw no cartridges that had any indication of being for that printer
[02/29/2008 10:41:38 AM] LordshipDoom: If it ain't there, it ain't there. Clint said we probably don't have any down here.
[02/29/2008 10:42:17 AM] bjcullinan: bummer
[02/29/2008 10:44:37 AM] LordshipDoom: Clint and Christian know of the problem, so I don't know what else you can do.:-(
[02/29/2008 10:45:20 AM] LordshipDoom: What type of printer is it?
[02/29/2008 11:26:49 AM] bjcullinan: First floor copy room printer is having problems.
