[03/02/2008 06:43:28 PM] bjcullinan: we found him laying down outside the condo in a pile of snow
[03/02/2008 06:43:35 PM] Joe Eagar: yeek.
[03/02/2008 06:43:42 PM] bjcullinan: meh
[03/02/2008 06:43:45 PM] Joe Eagar: so he was trying to walk home?
[03/02/2008 06:43:46 PM] bjcullinan: he walked home
[03/02/2008 06:44:04 PM] bjcullinan: i think he got tired of people making fun of him being drunk
[03/02/2008 06:45:07 PM] Joe Eagar: I wouldn't have thought he'd really notice, in his state :)

[03/02/2008 06:47:31 PM] Joe Eagar: the mouse bug?
[03/02/2008 06:47:35 PM] bjcullinan: nope
[03/02/2008 06:47:39 PM] bjcullinan: not that one yet
[03/02/2008 06:47:54 PM] Joe Eagar: ah :( which bug was it?
[03/02/2008 06:48:05 PM] bjcullinan: some bitreader bugs
[03/02/2008 06:49:06 PM] Joe Eagar: ah ok
[03/02/2008 06:50:10 PM] Joe Eagar: did you try that glcore I sent you?
[03/02/2008 06:52:32 PM] bjcullinan: yes but my gl drivers are crap on my laptop too so it stopped lagging but it still sucked

[03/02/2008 06:58:47 PM] Joe Eagar: this is interesting.  I think mouse move events are being sent every tick, regardless if the mouse cursor has changed.
[03/02/2008 06:59:20 PM] Joe Eagar: never mind
[03/02/2008 06:59:26 PM] Joe Eagar: I think abe fixed that recently

[03/02/2008 07:11:05 PM] Joe Eagar: ok, then it likely isn't a graphics card driver problem
