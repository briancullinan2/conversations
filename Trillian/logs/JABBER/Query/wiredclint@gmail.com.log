[09/14/2007 01:05:29 PM] bjcullinan: ok great, i probably won't see you again until thursday, that's the next time i am scheduled in engineering, but i'll check this weekend in-case that changes

[09/19/2007 03:21:18 PM] bjcullinan: how do i log someone off a locked computer?
[09/19/2007 03:22:20 PM] Clint Baker: Windows?  I don't think we've set up your admin account yet.  Either send me the hostname of the computer or just reboot it.
[09/19/2007 03:22:49 PM] bjcullinan: so i need an admin account and a key to the locker up here in ps 232
[09/19/2007 03:23:45 PM] Clint Baker: Right.  You and Akira need accounts.  We just need to go over some stuff before you guys start using them.
[09/19/2007 03:24:53 PM] bjcullinan: Ok, great i will be in the CENS building all day tomorrow
[09/19/2007 03:26:00 PM] Clint Baker: Ok.  I have cabinet keys for you now, so stop by whenever.

[09/19/2007 03:28:44 PM] bjcullinan: i need my laptop, to play team fortress 2 pre-release
[09/19/2007 03:30:26 PM] Clint Baker: Actually, if you are bored, you could go help out Ben and Kaj in the Dean's office.  Then one of them can come down here to man the helpdesk
[09/19/2007 03:30:56 PM] Clint Baker: I think they are in room 140, Bonnie ODonnell's office just north of the Dean's office.

[09/26/2007 03:24:32 PM] Clint Baker: Heh.  That isn't really the kind of thing we do.  Remind me to get you a copy of the Sys Admin Code of Ethics.  :)
[09/26/2007 03:26:10 PM] bjcullinan: Yeah i wasn't really going to spy, i was just interested if it was possible any further then the ps -A command
[09/26/2007 03:26:50 PM] bjcullinan: I know computer labs in highschool always had someone spying, but i guess under the age of 18 no one has any rights especially the right to privacy
[09/26/2007 03:29:11 PM] Clint Baker: That's actually kind of a touchy subject - the whole privacy thing.  It is one of the major reasons that the student workers don't get root access to anything but the local windows desktops.   We don't spy on anyone.  The only time it will ever come up is if someone complains, but it very rarely happens.
[09/26/2007 03:31:49 PM] bjcullinan: Ok.  Also i have to add my hours from last week to the hours to this week, since the system was just unlocked for me yesterday.
[09/26/2007 03:32:49 PM] bjcullinan: So if my hours appear to be more then usual, its because it is 3 weeks worth, instead of only 2.
[09/26/2007 03:32:55 PM] Clint Baker: Ok.  Generally if it is only a few hours, you can pad your current timesheet with those times.  Since you have been here a while, I believe there is a backpay link or form to fill out.
[09/26/2007 03:33:17 PM] Clint Baker: if you can come in under 30 hours on this timesheet, go ahead and do that.
[09/26/2007 03:33:28 PM] Clint Baker: 30/week
[09/26/2007 03:33:42 PM] bjcullinan: I am not a full time student anymore, does that affect the ability to make 30/week?
[09/26/2007 03:34:06 PM] Clint Baker: i don't believe so.  Student workers are capped at 30/wk
[09/26/2007 03:34:34 PM] bjcullinan: ok then i will have to extend this padding, or fill out that form
[09/26/2007 03:34:58 PM] bjcullinan: i have about 6 hours too many

[09/26/2007 03:39:15 PM] bjcullinan: oh 30/week, my mistake i was thinking total but that would be 2 weeks, i should have plenty of room

[09/26/2007 03:39:49 PM] bjcullinan: How do you think thunderbird compares to microsoft outlook?
[09/26/2007 03:40:44 PM] Clint Baker: like all things.  one has features/convenience that the other doesn't.
[09/26/2007 03:42:37 PM] Clint Baker: i don't run windows.  outlook is far too big and clumsy for what I want to do, which is check email.  I only recently, reluctantly, switched to a gui-based email client only because we have to support thunderbird.
[09/26/2007 03:42:55 PM] Clint Baker: if I could run pine, which is text-based, i'd be a happy guy.
[09/26/2007 03:44:53 PM] bjcullinan: Good to know.  I think i'll stick with outlook because i rather enjoy the integration between contacts and calendar and notes, and although there are some valiant attempts, i think outlook is more feature rich then the alternatives.
[09/26/2007 03:45:37 PM] Clint Baker: it is completely up to you.   you can be the outlook help guy since no one else here uses it.  However, you will need to be able to support tbird, as well.
[09/26/2007 03:46:01 PM] Clint Baker: what is ABE club?

[09/26/2007 03:47:31 PM] bjcullinan: I can adapt to many systems fairly quickly, i think i'll install tbird and browse around just to get familiar with it.  I am very familiar with outlook, i've even attempted to write extensions for office.
[09/26/2007 03:50:22 PM] bjcullinan: and actually i am available until 6:30 not 5:30, i just changed it

[01/18/2008 11:31:45 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[01/18/2008 11:32:45 AM] bjcullinan: hey if i start a display at location :1 what is the full path for that
[01/18/2008 11:32:52 AM] bjcullinan: is it localhost:0.1?
[01/18/2008 11:33:44 AM] Clint Baker: yes.  Or you can abbreviate it :0.1
[01/18/2008 11:34:20 AM] Clint Baker: Could you go up to room 153 really quick?  Marissa there says her computer is "sparking."  Could you carefully take a look and try to figure out what is wrong?
[01/18/2008 11:34:36 AM] bjcullinan: yeah sure
[01/18/2008 11:34:42 AM] bjcullinan: in bio building?
[01/18/2008 11:35:16 AM] Clint Baker: yes.  Graylyn's office.  Just up the hall from you.
[01/18/2008 11:35:20 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[01/18/2008 11:37:24 AM] bjcullinan: so i think the power strip is shorting out, where might i find a better one?
[01/18/2008 11:38:14 AM] Clint Baker: If there isn't one in your office there, then we'll have to bring one up from down here.
[01/18/2008 11:40:02 AM] bjcullinan: couldn't find one, we will have to put it on the todo list
[01/18/2008 11:41:36 AM] bjcullinan: so another display question, i am trying to get firefox to launch on a specific display, and DISPLAY=:1 works, but firefox --display=localhost:0.1 does not, and the problem is i can't use DISPLAY running from a PHP script, is there some other command that has the power of DISPLAY?
[01/18/2008 11:43:04 AM] Clint Baker: I thought you could set environment variables in PHP
[01/18/2008 11:44:16 AM] bjcullinan: so display is an environment variable?
[01/18/2008 11:44:52 AM] Clint Baker: Yes, you set an environment variable DISPLAY to the display you want to use, then all X stuff will show up on that display for that session.
[01/18/2008 11:45:17 AM] bjcullinan: that makes a lot more sense now
[01/18/2008 11:45:17 AM] Clint Baker: That is generally how one does X forwarding
[01/18/2008 11:45:50 AM] Clint Baker: I've never used the --display option in firefox and I can't find examples of other people using it.  
[01/18/2008 11:46:45 AM] bjcullinan: probably because it doesn't work the way you'd expect
[01/18/2008 11:46:58 AM] bjcullinan: i can't get it to work either
[01/18/2008 11:46:59 AM] Clint Baker: right.  I don't know what the argument should look like
[01/18/2008 11:47:46 AM] bjcullinan: well it seems to except localhost:0.1 and gives me an error on some other variations, but it always fails at logging on to the display
[01/18/2008 11:48:00 AM] bjcullinan: i even tried running it under the same user as the display
[01/18/2008 11:49:28 AM] Clint Baker: ah, that is one thing to check.  The host that is display 0:1 needs to allow X forwards.  That can be set with the xhost command like
 xhost +computername
[01/18/2008 11:51:14 AM] bjcullinan: yeah this might complicate it a little more, but i am not actually using x, i am using Xvfb
[01/18/2008 11:54:27 AM] Clint Baker: Hmmm... I'm not familiar with that.
[01/18/2008 11:55:01 AM] bjcullinan: it's a virtual frame buffer, i guess it is slimmer and used for running stuff that you don't actually need to see, but require a display
[01/18/2008 11:55:27 AM] bjcullinan: so i am trying to run a firefox command to create a thumbnail of a web page, but i don't want to have to install crappy kde or xorg stuff
[01/18/2008 11:55:34 AM] bjcullinan: on my webserver
[01/18/2008 11:56:01 AM] Clint Baker: reading about it now.  seems like it would be an interesting idea.
[01/18/2008 11:56:47 AM] bjcullinan: what i plan on doing with it is doing like a remote desktop/ google maps type of website rendering for mobile devices
[01/18/2008 11:57:28 AM] bjcullinan: so you connect to my site and type in an address and it renders the page remotely, and just sends the client a picture, and there will be some fancy javascripts to navigate
[01/18/2008 11:58:04 AM] Clint Baker: has the phone been ringing up there?
[01/18/2008 11:58:10 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[01/18/2008 11:58:26 AM] Clint Baker: Be sure to get that if it rings.  Kathy Clock is stopping by for a USB cable
[01/18/2008 11:59:00 AM] bjcullinan: i see a usb drive but no single cable
[01/18/2008 11:59:26 AM] bjcullinan: i think it is a good idea because microsoft will never release a good browser, and the phones don't have enough storage for an entire engine like Webkit anyways
[01/18/2008 12:07:54 PM] Clint Baker: ok, we'll get one for her down here

[01/28/2008 10:04:04 AM] bjcullinan: is someone on the line now?
[01/28/2008 10:04:32 AM] Clint Baker: Yes, we got it after it rang a couple of times.  
[01/28/2008 10:04:56 AM] bjcullinan: maybe it starts ringing down there sooner

[01/28/2008 10:30:26 AM] Clint Baker: not that I am aware of.  Which server?
[01/28/2008 10:30:31 AM] Clint Baker: or what is the problem?
[01/28/2008 10:30:44 AM] bjcullinan: she is having trouble connecting using a client
[01/28/2008 10:31:35 AM] bjcullinan: maybe you can help her troubleshoot sounds like the thinstation isn't pointing to the right place
[01/28/2008 10:34:27 AM] Clint Baker: so a Sun Ray, right?  Do you know who it is or what the problem is?
[01/28/2008 10:34:52 AM] Clint Baker: Or was this the girl from the BIO office that just called me?
[01/28/2008 10:40:59 AM] bjcullinan: yeah i gave her your number
[01/28/2008 10:41:06 AM] bjcullinan: what did the problem end up being?
[01/28/2008 10:42:35 AM] Clint Baker: So she was trying to connect to a share in S:\dept.  Pete sent out mail last week explaining this.  The dept directory in shared was moved over to ITS, so it now maps under R:.
[01/28/2008 10:42:52 AM] Clint Baker: I just had her open My Computer, go to R: and she found her stuff.
[01/28/2008 10:49:59 AM] bjcullinan: wow that is not what she explained to me
[01/28/2008 10:50:16 AM] bjcullinan: i asked her if she was logged on and she said "it isn't found"

[01/28/2008 11:22:17 AM] Clint Baker: yeah, a lot of people here are not horribly computer saavy.  A lot of how we troubleshoot is learing how to ask questions in such a way that we can determine the problem from their answers.  It's a skill you'll learn the more you do actual computer support.
[01/28/2008 11:23:35 AM] bjcullinan: a guy is having printer problems in 122 i think
[01/28/2008 11:23:45 AM] bjcullinan: i told him to call the number back to get someone down there
[01/28/2008 11:25:33 AM] Clint Baker: Ok, but remember that someone may not always be here.  The better way to handle that is to ask some questions - maybe restarting the printer would have helped.  If that doesn't work and you really can't help them over the phone, have them send email to (Link: mailto:censithelp@nau.edu)censithelp@nau.edu.  
[01/28/2008 11:26:22 AM] Clint Baker: If the problem is urgent and needs to be looked at immediately, and you can't help them, don't have the person call back or another number.  Get all their info, including name and contact info, and you can get ahold of us - via IM or direct phone and let us know what is going on.

[02/29/2008 10:29:37 AM] bjcullinan: I have no problem missing the class for a once in a long while meeting, but it would be helpful if i could leave work a half hour early to tend to the class assignment

[02/29/2008 10:30:25 AM] bjcullinan: yes, i thought i did because i dropped a class to add that one, but it really is no big deal.
[02/29/2008 10:30:47 AM] Clint Baker: If you need to miss work, email pete, christian and I, and also update Ocal with that information.  If you have any closing shifts that you'll miss, let us know as early as possible so we can get someone else to close.
[02/29/2008 10:31:34 AM] Clint Baker: No biggie if you can't make the meeting.  We'll just be going over some basic stuff that everyone should be doing.  One of us will just come by and get you that information later.

[03/05/2008 12:19:44 PM] bjcullinan: So the reason i use IM in one place is because of the chat logs, but i will have a solution for that by tomorrow.

[03/05/2008 12:20:06 PM] Clint Baker: you could always use the pc or the sun ray  :)
[03/05/2008 12:20:45 PM] bjcullinan: I like having logs of conversations, the sunray wouldn't really fix that.
[03/05/2008 12:21:14 PM] Clint Baker: I know you are working on homework projects, which I have no problem with - as long as it doesn't interfere with work.  Mostly you need to be available for work stuff.  If homework has to be done at home, so be it.
[03/05/2008 12:24:14 PM] bjcullinan: I completely understand and agree, I will sync my logs with my laptop today and launch it locally from now on.  The only reason i usually don't is because the logs will be split up across computers, hence harder to find previously discussed information.
[03/05/2008 12:25:12 PM] Clint Baker: that's fine.  :)

[03/05/2008 12:36:22 PM] Clint Baker: about what?
[03/05/2008 12:37:02 PM] bjcullinan: Called from the communications building, i told her to send us an e-mail.  I guess i will have to call her back and give her the ITS phone number.
[03/05/2008 12:38:05 PM] Clint Baker: The Univeristy at large gets IT help from the Solution Center (for faculty - 3-1511) or the Academic Computing Help Desk (for students 3-9294)

[03/05/2008 12:39:13 PM] bjcullinan: I am putting those numbers on this phone number sheet
[03/05/2008 12:39:55 PM] Clint Baker: Ok.  Do that
[03/05/2008 12:40:51 PM] Clint Baker: A better way to handle that would have been to go take a look.  For things like that, don't have them send mail it re-describing the problem because I'm just going to assign the ticket back to whomever is closest (in this case, you) and make you go look anyway.
[03/05/2008 12:41:05 PM] Clint Baker: Don't just respond to each phone call with "send us email"
[03/05/2008 12:42:40 PM] bjcullinan: Generally i wouldn't, but it is good to know we don't generally support the Com building
[03/05/2008 12:43:42 PM] bjcullinan: shall i call them back now and let them know?  the ticket showed up.
[03/05/2008 12:44:20 PM] Clint Baker: Yes, call them back and close the ticket out.

[03/05/2008 04:19:43 PM] bjcullinan: bummer, because i spend more time on campus then i do at home
[03/05/2008 04:20:40 PM] Clint Baker: yes, but your laptop isn't required for work.  We provide an abundance of computers for that.  They don't want every student shipping stuff there.  Try the bookstore - I know they have a post office of sorts there.

[04/02/2008 11:10:57 AM] bjcullinan: Sidney in bio just called she has new computers, should i go ahead an pick them up for imaging right now?
[04/02/2008 11:11:31 AM] bjcullinan: Christian and i did some imaging but we didn't get to the last part of adding the new computers to the network
[04/02/2008 11:18:12 AM] Clint Baker: Yes, you can start imaging them.  Do you know how to set up the computer accounts in AD?  That has to be done before joining them to the domain.
[04/02/2008 11:18:30 AM] Clint Baker: And if you send me MAC addresses, along with what rooms they will be assigned to, I'll add them to DNS/DHCP
[04/02/2008 11:23:24 AM] bjcullinan: I do not know how to add the accounts
[04/02/2008 11:23:57 AM] bjcullinan: I have a hard drive here with the images should i just use the latest faculty image?
[04/02/2008 11:24:08 AM] Clint Baker: Ok.  We'll show you.  For now, if you can just provide me with the MAC's and building/room numbers, I'll set that up.
[04/02/2008 11:24:20 AM] Clint Baker: Yes, faculty image.
[04/02/2008 11:25:35 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/02/2008 11:33:44 AM] bjcullinan: Also how do we usually go about copying stuff over to the new computers?  Should i just instruct them to copy stuff from the only one onto the network?
[04/02/2008 11:34:22 AM] Clint Baker: Yes.  BIO has a share on kashyyyk anyway.  That or their home directories are good places to keep that kind of data.
[04/02/2008 11:57:54 AM] bjcullinan: So for some reason this USB drive with the images isn't detecting, and Ghost freezes when it tries to open the file browser anyways (under from Image)
[04/02/2008 11:58:51 AM] bjcullinan: I think the CD may be messed up, could we get a new copy up here or can you tell me how to access the ghostsrv, because my login doesn't work
[04/02/2008 12:01:48 PM] Clint Baker: I can bring a ghost CD up.  You think that is what is causing the USB failure?
[04/02/2008 12:02:59 PM] bjcullinan: the A43 browser doesn't show the drive either
[04/02/2008 12:03:12 PM] bjcullinan: but if you come up you can log onto the ghostsrv
[04/02/2008 12:04:38 PM] Clint Baker: Was the USB disk attached before the computer was started up?
[04/02/2008 12:04:50 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[04/02/2008 12:05:00 PM] Clint Baker: BartPE won't recognize USB devices on the fly - if you plugged it in after booting, it won't work.
[04/02/2008 12:05:07 PM] bjcullinan: christian and i discovered that last time
[04/02/2008 12:08:19 PM] Clint Baker: ok.  don't know if I'll make it up there before you leave.  Keep at it.  There is no reason why USB should fail.  Try different USB ports, etc.
[04/02/2008 12:10:55 PM] bjcullinan: wait i see it in the boot menu this time
[04/02/2008 12:11:00 PM] Clint Baker: oh good
[04/02/2008 12:11:05 PM] bjcullinan: must have been the port
[04/02/2008 12:11:09 PM] bjcullinan: bummer
[04/02/2008 12:19:44 PM] bjcullinan: Ghost is still freezing up though
[04/02/2008 12:20:52 PM] Clint Baker: where does it freeze?  sure it isn't just taking a while?
[04/02/2008 12:23:21 PM] bjcullinan: Never took this long before, It freezes every time i try to open the dialog for selecting an Image in ghost
[04/02/2008 12:24:39 PM] Clint Baker: disk activity?  not sure what to tell you other than to keep poking at it.
[04/02/2008 12:25:47 PM] bjcullinan: Yeah it must be the cd, it is acting like a read error
[04/02/2008 12:25:52 PM] bjcullinan: no disk activity
[04/02/2008 12:37:08 PM] bjcullinan: Yeah must be the cd, it is pretty scratched up, and even though the USB drive is detected in the bios it still doesn't show up in A43
[04/02/2008 12:44:38 PM] Clint Baker: does ghost actually launch?
[04/02/2008 12:45:11 PM] Clint Baker: if ghost32 launches, then it isn't the CD.  The whole thing gets read into memory.
[04/02/2008 12:49:47 PM] Clint Baker: gotta run.  if you don't get finished, give the ticket on this to whomever comes in after you.  If not ticket exists - create one.
[04/02/2008 01:04:03 PM] bjcullinan: Well even though the USB drive shows up in the bios now, it isn't being detected in BartPE.

[04/04/2008 10:43:25 AM] Clint Baker: when you say the external HD isn't loading, is it not being recognized, or is the image itself not installing?

[09/04/2008 12:45:57 PM] bjcullinan: It doesn't desktop with Ultimate Boot but it just worked on the desktop, so maybe i will try i different USB port first.
[09/04/2008 12:48:36 PM] Clint Baker: You'll need to have the drive attached before powering it on - the windows on CD doesn't support hot-adding drives.  
[09/04/2008 12:49:44 PM] bjcullinan: yes, i did that

[09/05/2008 11:58:44 AM] bjcullinan: Well i don't know how to get it to work, partially because i am not sure what equipment controls the audio.
[09/05/2008 11:58:59 AM] bjcullinan: There is an amp in the cabinate which i would have to assume needs to be working.
[09/05/2008 11:59:18 AM] bjcullinan: But the amp and vcr and dvd player are all plugged in but no recieiving power.
[09/05/2008 11:59:30 AM] Clint Baker: ok, is the power outlet even hot?
[09/05/2008 12:15:11 PM] bjcullinan: Must not be, but i can't figure out how to turn it on/
[09/05/2008 12:15:36 PM] bjcullinan: Maybe there is a breaker on the outlet?
[09/05/2008 12:32:55 PM] Clint Baker: maybe.  you've plugged in some known good device to that outlet, right?
[09/05/2008 12:35:21 PM] Clint Baker: are you checking at the outlet or at a power strip or something down the way?  Grab something you know works and plug it directly into the wall and see what you get.
[09/05/2008 12:39:22 PM] bjcullinan: figured it out
[09/05/2008 12:39:29 PM] bjcullinan: there is a switch on the side of the cabinate
[09/05/2008 12:39:42 PM] bjcullinan: obviously people don't notice it, or don't know about it

[09/11/2008 01:17:06 PM] bjcullinan: Also a lady asked about using remote software available in the library in the new biology building, she said her department doesn't want to pay for it, but is convinced that students should still be able to use it without going to were it is available.
[09/11/2008 01:18:29 PM] bjcullinan: I know the business building offers an application server that students can sign in to, do we offer something like that, that would have the biology tools on it?

[09/16/2008 10:44:33 AM] Clint Baker: You there?
[09/16/2008 10:48:19 AM] Clint Baker: Wettaw room 130 (big lecture hall) has complaints of a dim projector.  It is available between 10:50 and 11:30.  I need you to go there, bring up all projectors and take a look.  There is a remote for the projectors in that room - if one is dim, take a look at the settings and make sure someone didn't turn it down.  Then let me know what you find.
[09/16/2008 10:50:59 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[09/16/2008 11:04:10 AM] bjcullinan: so when i got there the projector on the right didn't have the faintest glow coming from it, so i hit on using the remote and i heard the fans spin up
[09/16/2008 11:04:34 AM] bjcullinan: a green light is on which i think is power, and another green light was flashing which i think is standby
[09/16/2008 11:04:51 AM] bjcullinan: i could still hear the fans but nothing came on
[09/16/2008 11:05:22 AM] bjcullinan: so i hit the standby on the remote, and the on button on the computer control, and it seems to be stuck in this both red lights mode
[09/16/2008 11:05:32 AM] bjcullinan: maybe a burnt out bulb?

[09/18/2008 10:01:45 AM] Clint Baker: Some quick googling shows this is pretty young and not used a whole lot.  I'm not seeing any at newegg.  The specs document at the pci-sig page is password protected, but I've seen articles saying people have used 7m cables and one saying 30m is possible.
[09/18/2008 10:02:39 AM] Clint Baker: As far as where to buy one, you'll have to do some searching.  standard shops like newegg don't appear to have them.  I've found places that say they do, but they've all been "call to order" kinds of things.
[09/18/2008 10:10:20 AM] bjcullinan: and that is 7 meters?  so signal loss? i am thinking i might just make one
[09/18/2008 10:11:20 AM] bjcullinan: i have enough ide cables i could use, just need to order the part for the other end

[09/18/2008 11:28:37 AM] Clint Baker: Depends on how much time/money you want to spend making it go  :)

[09/22/2008 10:50:50 AM] bjcullinan: when changing the computer name to bio and room number, i have to add it to the domain
[09/22/2008 10:50:59 AM] bjcullinan: not sure what AD means
[09/22/2008 10:51:46 AM] bjcullinan: somethings with froot?
[09/22/2008 10:52:11 AM] Clint Baker: AD stands for Active Directory.  It is microsoft's directory database - it replaces and surpasses NT4 style domains.
 This computer is for the advisor person?
[09/22/2008 10:52:28 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[09/22/2008 10:52:58 AM] Clint Baker: Then it will go into nau.froot.nau.edu.  Have you created the account in AD yet?
[09/22/2008 10:53:09 AM] Clint Baker: If not, do not add the computer to the domain yet.
[09/22/2008 10:53:55 AM] bjcullinan: no i have not, i think pete showed me how once, but i forgot
[09/22/2008 10:54:26 AM] Clint Baker: ok. just be sure to never attempt to add a computer to the domain without first ensuring a computer account exists in that domain.
[09/22/2008 10:55:08 AM] Clint Baker: the account exists now.  you should be able to join nau.froot.nau.edu with your admin account
[09/22/2008 10:55:18 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[09/22/2008 10:55:51 AM] Clint Baker: while that comptuer reboots, there is a printer in there.  Can you send me the MAC address from it, please? 
[09/22/2008 10:56:06 AM] Clint Baker: There should be a test sheet on top of it. If not, plug it in and print one.
[09/22/2008 10:58:44 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[09/22/2008 10:59:18 AM] bjcullinan: so it is prompting for my username and password, but i am getting access denied, using nau-students\bjc76 as my login name

[09/22/2008 11:00:47 AM] bjcullinan: Got it.
[09/22/2008 11:07:58 AM] bjcullinan: I can't figure out how to print out the MAC, if i hold the print button it prints out a general information page about the series, but no setting information.
[09/22/2008 11:18:01 AM] Clint Baker: try holding the largest button down for a few seconds.
[09/22/2008 11:18:43 AM] Clint Baker: or look the model up on the web and get a manual.  Once I get that and you deliver the computer, I'll need you to go install that printer upstairs
[09/22/2008 11:18:55 AM] bjcullinan: omg, so 2 seconds prints info, 5+ seconds prints config
[09/22/2008 11:19:01 AM] Clint Baker: cool
[09/22/2008 11:19:03 AM] bjcullinan: i tried looking it up

[09/22/2008 11:19:43 AM] Clint Baker: what model printer is that?
[09/22/2008 11:19:56 AM] bjcullinan: LaserJet P2015dn
[09/22/2008 11:29:31 AM] Clint Baker: Ok.  Set the IP manually on that printer to 134.114.144.21, then take it up to room 324 and set it up where the old HP4 is now.  Make sure it is pingable.  If you need a key, you can get one from the BIO office on the second floor.
[09/22/2008 11:29:50 AM] Clint Baker: and let me know when that is up there and ready to go.
[09/22/2008 11:45:12 AM] Clint Baker: When you create tickets, please create them from the "customer" - i.e. the person who brought the issue to your attention.  I now have a ticket, that when closed, will notify me.  Doesn't really help anyone else out.
[09/22/2008 11:45:36 AM] Clint Baker: Also, get in the habit of setting the queue - don't just leave it in raw
[09/22/2008 11:48:28 AM] Clint Baker: Can you re-create that ticket for the person you talked to, please?
[09/22/2008 11:52:38 AM] bjcullinan: Recreate it?
[09/22/2008 11:52:56 AM] bjcullinan: a couple people have reported the problem
[09/22/2008 11:54:56 AM] Clint Baker: pick one.  :)

[09/22/2008 11:55:44 AM] Clint Baker: sorry, i'm going to delete the ticket you created for/by me
[09/22/2008 11:56:56 AM] bjcullinan: qait
[09/22/2008 11:56:57 AM] bjcullinan: wait
[09/22/2008 11:57:02 AM] bjcullinan: that tool me a while to type
[09/22/2008 11:57:27 AM] bjcullinan: *took
[09/22/2008 11:58:17 AM] Clint Baker: it was like 10 lines  :)
[09/22/2008 11:58:51 AM] bjcullinan: Ok, this is why i didn't create it right the first time.
[09/22/2008 11:59:03 AM] bjcullinan: Where do i put the person that notified me of the problem?
[09/22/2008 11:59:22 AM] bjcullinan: So there is a To: <queue name> and a From:
[09/22/2008 11:59:31 AM] bjcullinan: Sorry, backwards
[09/22/2008 11:59:47 AM] bjcullinan: there is a from Queue name, now if it is just being created it isn't From anywhere
[09/22/2008 12:00:32 PM] bjcullinan: Nvm E-mail ticket just doesn't make any sense
[09/22/2008 12:00:36 PM] bjcullinan: i will make it a phone
[09/22/2008 12:01:48 PM] Clint Baker: use phone ticket.  Ignore Type, "From" is the customer. "To" is the queue (Audio/Video in this case), Ignore "service" "SLA" and Owner is one of us that will take care of fixing it (me, for now).
[09/22/2008 12:02:11 PM] Clint Baker: know how this works.  You should be creating tickets far more often.
[09/22/2008 12:04:32 PM] bjcullinan: Yeah, i just forgot that i generally use the Phone Ticket side
[09/22/2008 12:04:46 PM] Clint Baker: ah
[09/22/2008 12:05:01 PM] Clint Baker: Is the advisor's computer set up?
[09/22/2008 12:05:18 PM] bjcullinan: So the IP cannot be set manually on this printer.  There is some software interface that has to be used to change the settings.
[09/22/2008 12:05:43 PM] bjcullinan: Yes, her computer is finished
[09/22/2008 12:08:14 PM] bjcullinan: The forums say the best way is just to assign it the IP in the router
[09/22/2008 12:08:23 PM] bjcullinan: or on the DHCP server i mean
[09/22/2008 12:08:35 PM] bjcullinan: So if you set the mac address won't that be done?
[09/22/2008 12:29:15 PM] Clint Baker: ok, that's fine, then.  The static IP I set for that printer probably won't take effect until the reload at midnight tonight.  Leave that printer there and set it up when you get in tomorrow.

[09/25/2008 10:42:17 AM] Clint Baker: yes  yes it does
[09/25/2008 10:42:25 AM] bjcullinan: people keep unplugging it, would it be possible to get it to not  come out of the wall?
[09/25/2008 10:42:42 AM] Clint Baker: No, it will have to be plugged in

[09/25/2008 10:53:54 AM] bjcullinan: yeah, that is what i thought
[09/25/2008 10:55:31 AM] bjcullinan: Some old lady locked it during the class.

[10/20/2008 11:29:45 AM] bjcullinan: I have a user that has run out of space on their shared drive in geology, could we look into where the space is being used and expand their quota, she says she only has some 500mb quota.
[10/20/2008 11:29:57 AM] bjcullinan: the username is ac78

[10/20/2008 11:34:19 AM] bjcullinan: it is in the geology lab, 105?
[10/20/2008 11:34:42 AM] Clint Baker: No, the server her shared drive lives on
[10/20/2008 11:35:00 AM] Clint Baker: Is she having trouble with files that live on kashyyyk, or one of ITS' servers?
[10/20/2008 11:35:14 AM] bjcullinan: I didn't have her check, so i am not sure.
[10/20/2008 11:35:27 AM] Clint Baker: ok
[10/20/2008 11:35:45 AM] bjcullinan: She mentioned using a website directory, but i suppose that doesn't narrow it down.
[10/20/2008 11:36:11 AM] bjcullinan: is there a callback feature on the phones?
[10/20/2008 11:36:40 AM] Clint Baker: ac78 has no home directory on our server.  The shared drives on our servers have no quotas set, so my guess is she is using her ITS space. Is she a student or faculty?
[10/20/2008 11:37:06 AM] bjcullinan: Student
[10/20/2008 11:37:14 AM] Clint Baker: you don't have contact information for her?

[11/04/2008 10:18:47 AM] Clint Baker: yeah, that sounds like it.  Could you call Bruce Bryant at 3-1319 and help him locate it?
[11/04/2008 10:18:47 AM] bjcullinan: kind of next to it, there is a short hall to a sign that says authorized personnel only or something to that effect.

[11/12/2008 12:40:12 PM] Clint Baker: we don't run listservs - ITS does.  And most of those are LDAP filters based on group criteria.  If these are students and are classified as seniors, they will be automatically added when their status with administration reflects that.
[11/12/2008 12:41:10 PM] Clint Baker: If this is a different list (something custom that is maintained by someone else), make a ticket.  Otherwise, if they are currently classified as seniors and aren't on the seniors list, they need to talk to the ACHD
[11/12/2008 12:41:27 PM] bjcullinan: ok i will call them back
[11/12/2008 12:43:31 PM] Clint Baker: Please get in the habit of making tickets for things rather than jotting down information and IMing it to someone.  One of the purposes of the ticket tracking system is for time accountability.  Our student worker budget is potentially partially based on how many hours get tracked in that database.
[11/12/2008 12:50:16 PM] bjcullinan: Sounds good, i just thought this was a more urgent issue, and could be resolved quickly.  Since we don't have certain privileges, like adding computers to the DNS, what kind of time frame can i relay to the person in need?  How long would it take for one of the manager to respond to something like that?  When we use IM the response is usually immediate, luckily most problems aren't very urgent.

And usually people don't need their computers build immediately in the middle of the day.  Urgent issues are things that would prevent an instructor from teaching a class, for example.

Your job is still simply to help the people who ask for it.  Just as a rule of thumb, if it isn't something you can get up and fix right away, make a ticket.  If it is something simple like answering a question or setting up someone's printer, you don't need to make a ticket.

[11/20/2008 12:43:20 PM] bjcullinan: They called on the phone, i forgot to ask them how they spelled their name.
[11/20/2008 12:43:31 PM] bjcullinan: They said the SunRay wasn't used for a long time.
[11/20/2008 12:44:26 PM] Clint Baker: mirriam powell is a department, not really a person.  Whenever you answer the phone, please make sure you get a name and a phone number to call them back on before you hang up.  there's no point in creating a ticket if we can't let the person know it is fixed.
[11/20/2008 12:45:48 PM] bjcullinan: i didn't realize it was the department.
[11/20/2008 12:48:10 PM] Clint Baker: I can see that.  Just don't rely on being able to look them up in the directory from a name alone.  Whenever you create a ticket, you should have at least a name and phone number.  if the problem has to do with hardware or something that is location specific, it needs the building name/number and room number as well.
[11/20/2008 12:48:54 PM] Clint Baker: all tickets should have that information in them.  Just ask yourself if you would have all the info you need to take care of a problem based on the info you provide.
[11/20/2008 12:48:54 PM] bjcullinan: Ok.  I'll try not to let it happen again.
[11/20/2008 12:49:17 PM] bjcullinan: Did we find a problem with it?
[11/20/2008 12:50:45 PM] Clint Baker: when we first started using sun rays, we loaned a bunch out to people but never kept track of who.  they moved them around, dumped them in corners, etc.  So I've disabled connections from all rays I don't know about.  This is apparently one of the 5 or so I'm missing.  I'll call around and find out who has it, then enable access on it.

[07/13/2009 01:45:07 PM] bjcullinan: i have a DNS server set up and i want to be able to access my website with bjcullinan.com (which works fine) but then i want to access my desktop with desktop.bjcullinan.com on the internal network
[07/13/2009 01:45:56 PM] bjcullinan: would i forward all traffic with iptables?  i don't think using bind forwarding will work because the desktop does not have a publicly accessible ip address, only an internal one
[07/13/2009 01:47:55 PM] Clint Baker: so you set up just a caching DNS server, then?
[07/13/2009 01:49:48 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2009 01:49:53 PM] Clint Baker: i.e. you have some hosting company set up to resolve your domain name to an IP, but you have an internal dns server set up just to get to the machines on your local net, right?
[07/13/2009 01:50:11 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[07/13/2009 01:50:38 PM] bjcullinan: i have subdomains that work just fine, it is just a matter of getting it to connect to a different computer internally
[07/13/2009 01:52:18 PM] Clint Baker: you'll probably want to use something like iptables to do port forwarding, then.  that's the simplest way.  so hitting port 80 will connect to whatever you have running a web server, requests to port whateverwindowsuses will connect to your windows box, etc.
[07/13/2009 01:53:01 PM] Clint Baker: the downside there is that you'd only be able to route traffic to one machine.  if you had 2 windows machines you wanted to connect to, you'd have to choose one or get the second machine to listen for rdp requests on another port.
[07/13/2009 01:54:45 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, but i was wondering if using the flag --source in iptables might fix that problem.  so for example i forward the RDP port to one server and depending on the domain iptables can forward to the specific computer
[07/13/2009 01:58:53 PM] Clint Baker: i think source just specifies the source port the request is coming from.  i don't see how you'd use that to route to a specific computer
[07/13/2009 02:01:28 PM] Clint Baker: the best option is to get your domain name to point to your own dns server.  then every machine can have it's own entry
[07/13/2009 02:03:52 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm, yeah the domain works fine i just am not sure how to get ip tables to foward all traffic based on sub domain
[07/13/2009 02:08:07 PM] Clint Baker: so specifically, what are you trying to do?  be able to type rdesktop machinea.subdomain.domain.tld and get it to connect to the right thing, right?
[07/13/2009 02:08:17 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2009 02:08:40 PM] bjcullinan: the -d option accepts a named address
[07/13/2009 02:08:45 PM] bjcullinan: so maybe that is what i what
[07/13/2009 02:08:48 PM] bjcullinan: *want
[07/13/2009 02:09:18 PM] bjcullinan: but i also want rdesktop machineb.bjcullinan.com to go to a different machine
[07/13/2009 02:14:55 PM] Clint Baker: and you want this to happen from your internal lan or from the outside?
[07/13/2009 02:18:14 PM] bjcullinan: outside the LAN
[07/13/2009 02:18:46 PM] Clint Baker: ok.  so if you do an nslookup on machinea.whatever and machineb.whatever, do you get the same or different IP addresses?
[07/13/2009 02:18:59 PM] Clint Baker: or do you only have whatever.com resolving?
[07/13/2009 02:22:30 PM] bjcullinan: same external IP address
[07/13/2009 02:22:44 PM] bjcullinan: the domain stuff it all working, i use other subdomains
[07/13/2009 02:22:50 PM] Clint Baker: just 209.250.30.30, right?
[07/13/2009 02:22:53 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2009 02:23:29 PM] bjcullinan: i just don't know how to get it to work with different computer on the internal network using the same port
[07/13/2009 02:24:54 PM] Clint Baker: so you have your nameservers set to point to that same external IP, so presumable you are running your dns server on that IP.  The thing is, unless you have public IP's for each machine on your LAN, there is no way to say that bob.bjcullinan.com is going to go someplace different than sue.bjcullinan.com
[07/13/2009 02:25:16 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2009 02:25:39 PM] bjcullinan: that's why i need iptables to forward the ports based on the name bob, or sue
[07/13/2009 02:26:29 PM] Clint Baker: port forwarding is your only option, as far as I know.  the source and destination options in iptables just refer to the source or destination IP addresses, but since the only ip that will hit your stuff is 209.250.30.30, that's the only place they will go.  I don't know of a way to embed a DNS request with something that iptables can read and route from.
[07/13/2009 02:27:05 PM] Clint Baker: If you could, then no one would pay for class a/b/c ip blocks
[07/13/2009 02:27:23 PM] Clint Baker: it would also negate the need for ipv6  :)
[07/13/2009 02:30:08 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i can't get even a single port in iptables to forward properly let alone 2 simultneously
[07/13/2009 02:30:38 PM] bjcullinan: prerouting should show up under forwards in the iptables --list right?
[07/13/2009 02:30:38 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[07/13/2009 02:45:20 PM] Clint Baker: don't know.  i don't have anything set up that way.  trying to find you an example
[07/13/2009 02:48:21 PM] Clint Baker: well, it still doesn't matter.  the only thing the forward is going to do is forward based on the port.  The IP is fixed.
