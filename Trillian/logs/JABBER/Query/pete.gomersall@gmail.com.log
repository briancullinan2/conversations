[07/07/2009 02:55:04 PM] bjcullinan: ah, that will help the downloading problem, however there is another problem
[07/07/2009 02:55:49 PM] bjcullinan: it requires the user to plug into power, and i could only find 1 adapter with the same voltages, i didn't look through every adapter that we have up there though
[07/07/2009 02:56:35 PM] bjcullinan: if we can't find more power adapters for them we would have to install the SP3 one computer at a time
[07/07/2009 02:57:00 PM] Pete Gomersall: The adapters are in the cabinet - there should be 26 and 6
[07/07/2009 02:58:31 PM] bjcullinan: yes, i suppose it may be possible to get enough length on some of them to set up multiple computer at a time, but all the adapters i see are zip tied in, so i guess we could remove a few
[07/07/2009 02:59:24 PM] Pete Gomersall: just unplug them from the cabinet. The issue with the cabinet is not to move it unless you unplug the cables from the back carefully

[07/08/2009 12:47:11 PM] bjcullinan: So i spent about 3 hours on 6 laptops yesterday and i am wondering if i am doing something wrong
[07/08/2009 12:48:09 PM] bjcullinan: It seems like there much be a fast way of doing this.  Maybe imaging would be faster?
[07/08/2009 12:52:29 PM] Pete Gomersall: You could do this - create an image and push to all. If we did this then it may be useful to start afresh from our current base image. However we do not have a place to connect 30 laptops with power and Ethernet - unless we just used 317 for staging. I do have the latitude already register in Ghost.
[07/08/2009 12:53:50 PM] bjcullinan: i thought about that, why don't we just get some switches together, i've got a 24 i could bring in
[07/08/2009 12:55:06 PM] bjcullinan: they don't have to be managed since they are already on the network
[07/08/2009 12:55:07 PM] Pete Gomersall: and all the power adapters?
[07/08/2009 12:56:05 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, that could be a problem, the batteries might last long enough, they don't have to be on power when imaging only for service pack upgrades
[07/08/2009 12:59:19 PM] Pete Gomersall: I think if we do this then just take the cart up to 317 and spread them out on the desks and use the power and Ethernet from there.
 There is an issue with the Latitude 110's not taking our old image; we would need to test with new. Also we would need to do the Vostro's and the new laptops separately
[07/08/2009 01:01:27 PM] bjcullinan: So we would have to remove all the power adapters from the cart?  Or do we have other ones that will work in 317?
[07/08/2009 01:02:29 PM] Pete Gomersall: or we could just use the Ethernet\batteries - a small image would only take 15/20 minutes
[07/08/2009 01:03:27 PM] bjcullinan: I guess i can wait and ask Ben what he thinks the faster solution will be, seems like this will take a lot of setting up.  I can get other stuff done while some of the updates are running at least.
