[02/29/2008 11:39:13 AM] Christian McHugh: I don't even know what that means 
[02/29/2008 11:41:33 AM] bjcullinan: a serializer takes information and converts it to something it can read in later
[02/29/2008 11:42:00 AM] bjcullinan: so if i have something that says Block: name is "example", value is 100
[02/29/2008 11:42:22 AM] bjcullinan: a serializer will convert that information to maybe block,"example",100
[02/29/2008 11:42:35 AM] bjcullinan: and it will know how to read that in later and make an object out of it
[02/29/2008 11:42:43 AM] Christian McHugh: gocha
[02/29/2008 11:44:15 AM] bjcullinan: so i am doing it in binary because it is really fast

[04/14/2008 09:53:38 AM] bjcullinan: and how do we rebuild that
[04/14/2008 09:53:52 AM] bjcullinan: because there is a guy that keeps getting errors when it is trying to be accessed

[04/14/2008 09:59:28 AM] Christian McHugh: yeah, looks like only nau.edu accounts can send to that list
[04/14/2008 09:59:47 AM] Christian McHugh: you could try webmail and see if that will let you
[04/14/2008 09:59:48 AM] bjcullinan: will you forward the e-mail to the list serve?

[04/14/2008 12:27:25 PM] bjcullinan: also i have heard of that problem before
[04/14/2008 12:27:29 PM] Christian McHugh: working much longer?
[04/14/2008 12:27:31 PM] bjcullinan: it is totally because dell sucks
[04/14/2008 12:27:38 PM] Christian McHugh: they sure do
[04/14/2008 12:27:42 PM] bjcullinan: it gets tired of working and shuts off completely in sleep mode
[04/14/2008 12:27:52 PM] bjcullinan: had that problem under linux too
[04/14/2008 12:28:10 PM] Christian McHugh: she is in the trailers next to peterson, in the parking lot, just south of the english building
[04/14/2008 12:28:12 PM] Christian McHugh: room 23a
[04/14/2008 12:28:15 PM] bjcullinan: you have to do some crazy hack in linux so that it can detect the signal to wake up
[04/14/2008 12:28:33 PM] bjcullinan: i will go take a look
[04/14/2008 12:28:35 PM] Christian McHugh: she said she should be between offices, so give her a call at 3-1718 and she'll make sure she's there

[04/21/2008 10:35:00 AM] bjcullinan: i just read an article about shutting down your mac with an e-mail
[04/21/2008 10:35:05 AM] Christian McHugh: woah                  
[04/21/2008 10:35:14 AM] Christian McHugh: sounds scary                  
[04/21/2008 10:35:17 AM] bjcullinan: i should make something for windows and linux that does that
[04/21/2008 10:35:32 AM] Christian McHugh: what's wrong with ssh and shutting down?
[04/21/2008 10:35:46 AM] bjcullinan: do it from your cell phone, that was the objective
[04/21/2008 10:35:55 AM] bjcullinan: and the iphone doesn't yet support ssh
[04/21/2008 10:35:56 AM] Christian McHugh: ah
[04/21/2008 10:36:24 AM] bjcullinan: but it might be coming because iphone went open source
[04/21/2008 10:36:47 AM] Christian McHugh: I know they released an sdk but it is open source now?
[04/21/2008 10:37:12 AM] bjcullinan: well i meant the sdk
[04/21/2008 10:37:28 AM] bjcullinan: it seems pretty comprehensive
[04/21/2008 10:38:17 AM] bjcullinan: anywho i am thinking it might be easier to do through jabber, using a script similar to that one you found
[04/21/2008 10:38:28 AM] bjcullinan: or possibly using a chat client to do it
[04/21/2008 10:38:39 AM] Christian McHugh: perhaps

[04/28/2008 09:33:38 AM] Christian McHugh: so you plan on comming in when you get pants?

[04/28/2008 11:03:12 AM] bjcullinan: this is a ridiculous occurrence, seems like i miss work once a semester, i realize i am expendable, but i do value this job
[04/28/2008 11:03:26 AM] Christian McHugh: :) no problem
[04/28/2008 11:04:17 AM] Christian McHugh: are you a css wizard?
[04/28/2008 11:04:34 AM] bjcullinan: somewhat
[04/28/2008 11:04:50 AM] Christian McHugh: on the cens website there is a stylesheet that defines {background:url(somepic.gif);}
[04/28/2008 11:04:50 AM] bjcullinan: dreamweaver makes it easy, but w3schools works too
[04/28/2008 11:04:59 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[04/28/2008 11:05:06 AM] Christian McHugh: but on some pages I want to override that with nothing
[04/28/2008 11:05:10 AM] Christian McHugh: I don't want it defined
[04/28/2008 11:05:17 AM] Christian McHugh: currently I've done that with {background:url(none);}
[04/28/2008 11:05:20 AM] Christian McHugh: which works great
[04/28/2008 11:05:29 AM] bjcullinan: that will give a missing file error
[04/28/2008 11:05:30 AM] Christian McHugh: except that the logs are then filled with 404 can'
[04/28/2008 11:05:40 AM] bjcullinan: you can actually just leave the none out and leave it blank
[04/28/2008 11:05:42 AM] Christian McHugh: can't find ./none errors
[04/28/2008 11:05:46 AM] bjcullinan: it should still work
[04/28/2008 11:05:49 AM] bjcullinan: yeah makes sense
[04/28/2008 11:05:52 AM] Christian McHugh: so just {background:url();}
[04/28/2008 11:05:53 AM] Christian McHugh: should do it?
[04/28/2008 11:06:09 AM] bjcullinan: i would leave off the url too so background:;
[04/28/2008 11:06:19 AM] Christian McHugh: cool, thanks
[04/28/2008 11:10:45 AM] bjcullinan: also maybe try leaving out url() and just putting none there
[04/28/2008 11:11:11 AM] bjcullinan: it should not be standard css, but it will stop the missing file in the logs
[04/28/2008 11:11:21 AM] Christian McHugh: cool
[04/28/2008 11:11:33 AM] bjcullinan: you can also use background-image if you still want to use a color for the background

[04/28/2008 02:02:21 PM] Christian McHugh: this gives us a paper trail to say, yes it is but the tech's are out helping people
[04/28/2008 02:02:58 PM] Christian McHugh: as of right now we don't know if you guys are arriving late or if you are out helping, the sign out sheet gives just that report
[04/28/2008 02:10:34 PM] bjcullinan: it seems like a better solution is that if we are needed during those times, they should leave us messages as evidence
[04/28/2008 02:11:16 PM] bjcullinan: i never understand that about outsiders look on IT departments, they want the tech guys to be there just to be there, not because they atually have a problem or are inconvenienced

[11/17/2008 11:27:20 AM] bjcullinan: yes, i can't vote
[11/17/2008 11:27:21 AM] bjcullinan: answering the phone was a pain, they log every single call, i didn't do it much, i did appointments and fixed computers.  i made me hate computers, faculty at least understands that they should screw stuff up, students don't get that.  and they did have a training session, and by training i mean team building exercise.

[11/17/2008 11:29:11 AM] bjcullinan: yeah, but airsoft could get caught in the AC units and make the fans stop.  we should just go to like buffalo wild wings or something

[06/27/2009 10:27:26 PM] bjcullinan: in which case it would show up as running on the connected terminal but ssh and website wouldn't work

[07/13/2009 01:02:29 PM] Christian McHugh: Shoot
[07/13/2009 01:02:51 PM] bjcullinan: in engineering we can long in to windows.cefns.nau.edu using the default port 3389 for terminal services, and we can also log in to multiple terminals like sftp.cefns.nau.edu and acm.cefns.nau.edu
[07/13/2009 01:03:03 PM] Christian McHugh: Or i'l be back tomorrow if you want to wait
[07/13/2009 01:03:12 PM] Christian McHugh: Yeah
[07/13/2009 01:03:13 PM] bjcullinan: how do you rewrite an entire subdomain to a different server?  is it using ip tables?
[07/13/2009 01:03:37 PM] Christian McHugh: What do you mean?
[07/13/2009 01:03:44 PM] bjcullinan: because i should only have to use one DNS server
[07/13/2009 01:03:57 PM] Christian McHugh: Like try to logon to wacky.stuff and have that be acm?
[07/13/2009 01:04:04 PM] Christian McHugh: Oh!
[07/13/2009 01:04:05 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2009 01:04:11 PM] Christian McHugh: It is dns forwarding
[07/13/2009 01:04:27 PM] bjcullinan: DNS forwarding?  so not using ip tables?
[07/13/2009 01:04:53 PM] Christian McHugh: On your server it is only authorative for its own stuff so you have a line that for all other queries ask ****
[07/13/2009 01:04:56 PM] Christian McHugh: Yeah
[07/13/2009 01:05:03 PM] bjcullinan: so there is a DNS configuration that says when this name is hit make everything go somewhere else
[07/13/2009 01:05:09 PM] Christian McHugh: It is handled by the dns server
[07/13/2009 01:05:29 PM] bjcullinan: ohhh
[07/13/2009 01:05:36 PM] Christian McHugh: If you are authorative for the name being hit, yeah
[07/13/2009 01:06:07 PM] bjcullinan: so like if i had a subdomain for bjcullinan.com instead of putting my public IP address i could put an internal ip addess and it will send all traffic to that computer?
[07/13/2009 01:06:48 PM] bjcullinan: you know it's like <subdomain>     NS     <ip>
[07/13/2009 01:07:09 PM] bjcullinan: so i could put <some server>     NS      <192.168.**>
[07/13/2009 01:08:21 PM] Christian McHugh: I have not figured how to mix internal addresses with an externally accessable dns server
[07/13/2009 01:12:29 PM] Christian McHugh: So I'm not really too sure
[07/13/2009 01:12:43 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm i'll figure it out
