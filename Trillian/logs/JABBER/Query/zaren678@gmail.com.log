[09/25/2007 10:42:32 AM] bjcullinan: for some reason sometimes the cards start sessions on different servers and don't always refer back to the one previously started

[10/09/2007 05:42:51 PM] John Anderson: yup
[10/09/2007 05:43:37 PM] bjcullinan: what OS?
[10/09/2007 05:44:06 PM] John Anderson: I did linux first... but then I accidently blew up that computer... so now its in windows on my wife'e computer
[10/09/2007 05:46:33 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[10/09/2007 05:47:43 PM] John Anderson: mythtv is awesome though, I just didn't want to have to reboot everytime I wanted to watch TV... but with VM's getting so good I could probably VM mythtv... 
[10/09/2007 05:49:51 PM] bjcullinan: that's what i was thinking about doing, but you can't transfer PCI hardware to a VM
[10/09/2007 05:50:09 PM] John Anderson: ummm.... are you sure about that?
[10/09/2007 05:50:22 PM] bjcullinan: vm = virtual machine right?
[10/09/2007 05:50:25 PM] John Anderson: yeah
[10/09/2007 05:50:27 PM] bjcullinan: vmware can't do it yet
[10/09/2007 05:50:46 PM] bjcullinan: what is the other popular one?
[10/09/2007 05:50:52 PM] John Anderson: wait... so you're telling me.... if I had a PCI sound card in my computer... I couldn't use it in VMware?
[10/09/2007 05:51:55 PM] John Anderson: parallels is supposed to be good
[10/09/2007 05:52:00 PM] John Anderson: but its not free
[10/09/2007 05:52:46 PM] bjcullinan: you can use the soundcard for output from the virtual machine, but the guest OS doesn't recognize that soundcard, it will only see the VMware one
[10/09/2007 05:52:56 PM] John Anderson: ahhh
[10/09/2007 05:53:00 PM] bjcullinan: maybe Xen is different
[10/09/2007 05:53:39 PM] bjcullinan: a better example, if i have a PCI video card, i can use my host operating system on it however i like, but i can't make a guest machine use that video card directly
[10/09/2007 05:53:44 PM] John Anderson: get a network capture device
[10/09/2007 05:54:27 PM] bjcullinan: that might work, or just get a USB TV Wonder card because you can transfer serial devices to the guest OS
[10/09/2007 05:54:53 PM] John Anderson: if you're going linux don't get an ATI device
[10/09/2007 05:55:22 PM] bjcullinan: i have a hauppage card too
[10/09/2007 05:55:39 PM] John Anderson: which one?
[10/09/2007 05:55:58 PM] bjcullinan: can't remember but my roommate dave bought it with a sageTV package
[10/09/2007 05:56:09 PM] John Anderson: single or dual tuner?
[10/09/2007 05:56:20 PM] John Anderson: I bet its the PVR150... good card
[10/09/2007 05:56:27 PM] John Anderson: probably the best supported card in linux
[10/09/2007 05:56:54 PM] bjcullinan: i think that is it
[10/09/2007 05:56:56 PM] bjcullinan: sounds familiar
[10/09/2007 05:58:04 PM] bjcullinan: and a TV wonder 650 which is supposed to be supported too
[10/09/2007 05:58:12 PM] bjcullinan: and an all in wonder
[10/09/2007 06:03:02 PM] John Anderson: I'm not sure that either of those are supported in linux
[10/09/2007 06:03:09 PM] John Anderson: I could be wrong but I'd double check if I were you
[10/09/2007 06:07:17 PM] bjcullinan: the pvr came with a sageTV subscriptions
[10/09/2007 06:08:10 PM] bjcullinan: you should help me with my box sometime, i want to put myth on it but i have no experience with it
[10/09/2007 06:08:35 PM] John Anderson: do you already have a linux box that you want to install it on... or are you starting from scratch
[10/09/2007 06:08:56 PM] bjcullinan: i have a box to install it on
[10/09/2007 06:09:07 PM] bjcullinan: and i use linux
[10/09/2007 06:09:20 PM] John Anderson: hehe, that you're probably better at it than I am
[10/09/2007 06:09:24 PM] bjcullinan: but not enough to spend hours debugging when someone might already have the answers
