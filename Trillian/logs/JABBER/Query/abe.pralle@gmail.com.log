[02/29/2008 01:06:27 AM] Abe Pralle: cool, thanks
[02/29/2008 01:07:07 AM] bjcullinan: just got my settings reader implemented with binary files, tomorrow i am going to serialize with richards xml stream
[02/29/2008 01:07:28 AM] bjcullinan: you need a Serializable object in plasma core
[02/29/2008 01:09:21 AM] Abe Pralle: I dunno... it'd be a real pain to write and serialized files are easily broken.
[02/29/2008 01:10:16 AM] bjcullinan: Yeah, that's true, i guess i will just stick with my proprietary stuff
[02/29/2008 01:11:07 AM] bjcullinan: this should make it uber fast though when recording

[03/02/2008 03:53:43 PM] bjcullinan: So it looks like I am having trouble reading back in signed Int64
[03/02/2008 03:53:53 PM] bjcullinan: Do i need to read in 65 bits?
[03/02/2008 03:54:07 PM] Abe Pralle: No
[03/02/2008 03:54:51 PM] Abe Pralle: I'll take a look later tonight if you don't spot a bug.
[03/02/2008 03:54:52 PM] bjcullinan: Should i send you a test program that can re-create the problem i am having, because i can't figure it out, i am sure it is just a type casting problem.
[03/02/2008 03:55:20 PM] Abe Pralle: Yeah, sure
[03/02/2008 03:55:41 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[03/02/2008 04:06:37 PM] bjcullinan: Sent you an e-mail with the info.

[03/02/2008 05:37:30 PM] bjcullinan: Nope still got the same problem with the reader.  Everything else works except it isn't reading the right numbers.
[03/02/2008 05:37:36 PM] bjcullinan: You take a look at my example?
[03/02/2008 05:37:46 PM] Abe Pralle: am now
[03/02/2008 05:39:21 PM] bjcullinan: The one type cast i sent you earlier didn't seem to fix it entirely.
[03/02/2008 05:40:32 PM] Abe Pralle: what's an example #?
[03/02/2008 05:40:35 PM] Abe Pralle: that fails?
[03/02/2008 05:40:51 PM] Abe Pralle: ah, got one
[03/02/2008 05:41:20 PM] bjcullinan: If you look at the trace most of them do, seems to be mostly negatives, but quadrant 2 works fine
[03/02/2008 05:41:27 PM] bjcullinan: An entire classes worth of beta testers, your engine is going to be perfect pretty soon.
[03/02/2008 05:46:59 PM] bjcullinan: So it doesn't seem to be to_Int64 or to_Real64 because converting them back and forth produces the same number perfectly.
[03/02/2008 05:47:16 PM] Abe Pralle: RE: beta: totally. :)
[03/02/2008 05:47:21 PM] Abe Pralle: Yeah, it's a problem in the BitReader somewhere
[03/02/2008 05:58:21 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i will just split it up manually for now
[03/02/2008 05:58:55 PM] Abe Pralle: Try these two methods:
[03/02/2008 05:58:58 PM] Abe Pralle:     method read_Int64.Int64:
      # Returns the next 64 bits as an Int64 assumed to be in 
      # high-low byte order.
      local Int64 a = Int64(read(32)).left_shifted(32)
      local Int64 b = (Int64(read(32)) & Int64(0xffffffff00000000))
      return a | b

    method read_Int64_low_high.Int64:
      # Returns the next 64 bits as an Int64 assumed to be in 
      # low-high byte order.
      local Int64 result = Int64(read_low_high(32)) & Int64(0xffffffff)
      return result | Int64(read_low_high(32)).left_shifted(32)

[03/02/2008 06:01:54 PM] Abe Pralle: If you're reading from a file those two fixes should be enough.  But if you're writing/reading a Char list or something, you'll need this fix too:
[03/02/2008 06:01:55 PM] Abe Pralle:     method fill_buffer( Int32 to_n_bits ):
      # Internal use.
      while (bit_count < to_n_bits and src.has_another)
        bit_buffer = bit_buffer.left_shifted(8) | (src.read & 255)
        bit_count += 8
      endWhile

[03/02/2008 06:02:21 PM] Abe Pralle: (all in standard.slag BitReader)
[03/02/2008 06:16:05 PM] bjcullinan: Ok so now it shows the right angle in every quadrant, but if you look at my example again, there are still angles that don't convert correctly.
[03/02/2008 06:16:13 PM] bjcullinan: * convert back and forth
[03/02/2008 06:16:58 PM] bjcullinan: -2.8687
[03/02/2008 06:17:20 PM] bjcullinan: 0.1810

[09/25/2008 02:31:21 PM] Abe Pralle: Thanks!  Eh, it's fine. If you really want to know: NAU made me migrate to the NAU server and dropped my forward.  I had to email them to set up the new forward - and did so, but it doesn't look like the forward's gone through yet 'cause all my school mail gets sent to my school box.  But when I email my NAU address from Gmail using my NAU "from" address, the email shows up in my Gmail box right away, which makes me think that Gmail's just putting it in my inbox without sending it through NAU - so I needed to test and make sure that something sent from "Gmail as NAU" would still get through.
