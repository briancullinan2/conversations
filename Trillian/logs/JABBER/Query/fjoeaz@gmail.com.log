[02/20/2008 12:51:25 PM] bjcullinan: why would you need a server like that?
[02/20/2008 12:51:39 PM] bjcullinan: with linux on it?
[02/20/2008 12:51:47 PM] bjcullinan: that is soooo graphics intensive
[02/20/2008 12:52:00 PM] bjcullinan: most distros don't even come with opengl support
[02/20/2008 12:53:00 PM] Joe Flieger: it suposed to support huge floating points with crazy flops
[02/20/2008 12:53:24 PM] Joe Flieger: its not for grafics
[02/20/2008 12:53:30 PM] Joe Flieger: its for proccessing
[02/20/2008 12:53:33 PM] Joe Flieger: data
[02/20/2008 12:53:54 PM] Joe Flieger: u use the video card like a specialized super computer
[02/20/2008 12:54:10 PM] bjcullinan: sounds dumb
[02/20/2008 12:55:28 PM] Joe Flieger: 4 gpu version can proccess 512 threads at once

[02/20/2008 12:56:16 PM] Joe Flieger: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Tesla)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVIDIA_Tesla
[02/20/2008 12:58:48 PM] Joe Flieger: As of 2007, the fastest PC processors perform over 30 GFLOPS.[9] GPUs in PCs are considerably more powerful in terms of pure FLOPS. For example, in the GeForce 8 Series the nVidia 8800 Ultra performs around 576 GFLOPS on 128 Processing elements. This equates to around 4.5 GFLOPS per element, compared with 2.75 per core for the Blue Gene/L. It should be noted that the 8800 series performs only Single precision calculations, and that while GPUs are highly efficient at calculations they are not as flexible as a general purpose CPU.
[02/20/2008 01:00:31 PM] Joe Flieger: more processing power and threads per gpu then blue has
[02/20/2008 01:08:10 PM] Joe Flieger: high-k metal transistor
[02/20/2008 01:08:18 PM] Joe Flieger: no more silicon
[02/20/2008 01:08:28 PM] Joe Flieger: Stacked Gate Transistor
[02/20/2008 01:08:35 PM] Joe Flieger: 3d transistors
[02/20/2008 01:08:54 PM] Joe Flieger: ne how
[02/20/2008 01:09:14 PM] Joe Flieger: i would of gone with new cool technoligies
[02/20/2008 01:09:37 PM] Joe Flieger: probably would of sparked more questions and intrest
[02/20/2008 01:10:18 PM] Joe Flieger: people would have things to ask as opposed to just coving things the have in there computer at home and they would allready know about

[04/09/2008 05:47:27 PM] Joe Flieger: Extra Credit (10 pts). Make your interpreter handle the ";" function in Prolog, i.e., after it finds one answer, you can hit ";" to re-start the proof process to find further answers. You must clearly indicate on your cover sheet that you have tackled this challenge and wish to have it evaluated. Note: this is a fairly meaty challenge; don't waste time on it until you have to core functionality completely perfected.
[04/09/2008 05:47:57 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i havent even looked at the assignment

[07/31/2008 01:31:12 AM] Joe Flieger: there probaly not coming out with a gps phone since it looks like all the plam os phones are going to be for casual users and not power users
[07/31/2008 01:31:26 AM] bjcullinan: i think the centro has gps
[07/31/2008 01:31:31 AM] Joe Flieger: nope
[07/31/2008 01:31:36 AM] bjcullinan: oh

[07/31/2008 01:32:09 AM] Joe Flieger: i just got a 700p for free cuz i water dunked my phone
[07/31/2008 01:32:12 AM] Joe Flieger: too
[07/31/2008 01:32:27 AM] Joe Flieger: well basicly free
[07/31/2008 01:32:38 AM] bjcullinan: oh
[07/31/2008 01:33:02 AM] Joe Flieger: but then the 800w came out and i was like hmm maybe i should lookinto this whole windows os
[07/31/2008 01:33:06 AM] Joe Flieger: my brother said he likes it
[07/31/2008 01:33:32 AM] Joe Flieger: and i didnt realize it used outlook for its pc storage which would be nice
[07/31/2008 01:34:12 AM] Joe Flieger: and windows software for mobil devices is much easier to find then palm
[07/31/2008 01:34:49 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/31/2008 01:34:50 AM] Joe Flieger: besides im a sprint customer
[07/31/2008 01:35:44 AM] Joe Flieger: anyhow the 800w is a lil bigger then the centro
[07/31/2008 01:35:57 AM] Joe Flieger: but alot smaller then the 700's
[07/31/2008 01:36:07 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/31/2008 01:36:46 AM] Joe Flieger: and it would only be 250 from sprint
[07/31/2008 01:39:12 AM] Joe Flieger: and no none of the 700's have gps
[07/31/2008 01:39:28 AM] Joe Flieger: 800w is first phone to have it

[09/15/2008 12:40:08 AM] Joe Flieger:  smoothly slowing down = constant speed
[09/15/2008 12:40:10 AM] bjcullinan: so the equation he gave us in class?

[09/15/2008 12:40:27 AM] Joe Flieger:  but thats the only thing tricky about that one
[09/15/2008 12:40:41 AM] Joe Flieger:  once u realize that smooth slow down = constant accel
[09/15/2008 12:40:51 AM] Joe Flieger:  it was really easy
[09/15/2008 12:41:09 AM] Joe Flieger:  i didnt go to class on wen or fri i dont think

[09/15/2008 01:00:40 AM] Joe Flieger:  out
[09/15/2008 01:00:46 AM] bjcullinan: what two equations?
[09/15/2008 01:00:59 AM] Joe Flieger:  so a = vf-vi/t
[09/15/2008 01:01:15 AM] Joe Flieger:  which is a = avg v / t
[09/15/2008 01:01:41 AM] Joe Flieger:  avg v = posf -posi/t
[09/15/2008 01:02:08 AM] Joe Flieger:  so wiat
[09/15/2008 01:02:10 AM] Joe Flieger:  shit

[09/22/2008 12:24:51 AM] bjcullinan: *yup
[09/22/2008 12:25:01 AM] bjcullinan: so #5 what kind of answer are they looking for?
[09/22/2008 12:25:09 AM] Joe Flieger: the right one? 
[09/22/2008 12:25:22 AM] Joe Flieger: A girl delivering newspapers covers her route by traveling 5.00 blocks west, 6.00 blocks north, and then 7.00 blocks east.  
[09/22/2008 12:25:23 AM] Joe Flieger: this? 
[09/22/2008 12:25:29 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/22/2008 12:25:32 AM] bjcullinan: same numbers too
[09/22/2008 12:25:41 AM] bjcullinan: wait nvm
[09/22/2008 12:25:43 AM] Joe Flieger: draw it out 
[09/22/2008 12:25:52 AM] bjcullinan: i mean on the left
[09/22/2008 12:25:54 AM] Joe Flieger:  then connet the end dots
[09/22/2008 12:26:00 AM] bjcullinan: how many blocks?
[09/22/2008 12:26:11 AM] Joe Flieger: what? 
[09/22/2008 12:26:20 AM] bjcullinan: displacement blocks?
[09/22/2008 12:26:24 AM] Joe Flieger: yes 
[09/22/2008 12:26:28 AM] bjcullinan: what is that?
[09/22/2008 12:26:32 AM] Joe Flieger: ahh 
[09/22/2008 12:26:34 AM] Joe Flieger: ok 
[09/22/2008 12:26:40 AM] bjcullinan: how many up + how many sideways?
[09/22/2008 12:26:41 AM] Joe Flieger: so like u make these 3 lines right? 
[09/22/2008 12:26:46 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/22/2008 12:26:50 AM] Joe Flieger: one west one north one east 
[09/22/2008 12:27:03 AM] Joe Flieger:  then u connect the begingin of west with the end of east
[09/22/2008 12:27:13 AM] Joe Flieger:  and thats the displacemnt
[09/22/2008 12:27:21 AM] Joe Flieger:  like whats the distance to phx?
[09/22/2008 12:27:27 AM] Joe Flieger: not taking roads 
[09/22/2008 12:27:40 AM] bjcullinan: i am still confused
[09/22/2008 12:27:44 AM] Joe Flieger:  thats your displacment if you take the roads or not
[09/22/2008 12:28:00 AM] Joe Flieger: not distance travled 
[09/22/2008 12:28:02 AM] bjcullinan: so the furthest west block to the furthest and most north block traveled?
[09/22/2008 12:28:14 AM] Joe Flieger: call me 
[09/22/2008 12:28:18 AM] bjcullinan: neg
[09/22/2008 12:28:24 AM] bjcullinan: you talk too much
[09/22/2008 12:28:31 AM] Joe Flieger: fag 
[09/22/2008 12:28:33 AM] Joe Flieger: ok 
[09/22/2008 12:28:36 AM] bjcullinan: # 6
[09/22/2008 12:28:38 AM] Joe Flieger: lets call you 
[09/22/2008 12:28:41 AM] Joe Flieger: pt a 
[09/22/2008 12:28:45 AM] Joe Flieger:  lets call nau pt b
[09/22/2008 12:29:04 AM] Joe Flieger:  and lets call iono kiefers pt c
[09/22/2008 12:29:22 AM] Joe Flieger:  so if you go from you place to kiefers to mine
[09/22/2008 12:29:30 AM] Joe Flieger: a - c - b 
[09/22/2008 12:29:40 AM] Joe Flieger: whats the distance from a - b 
[09/22/2008 12:29:50 AM] Joe Flieger: start and end displacment 
[09/22/2008 12:30:08 AM] Joe Flieger:  like if u whent to nau and back home
[09/22/2008 12:30:16 AM] Joe Flieger:  your displacment would be 0
[09/22/2008 12:30:46 AM] Joe Flieger:  making sence yet?
[09/22/2008 12:30:53 AM] bjcullinan: so it is the length between start point and end point?
[09/22/2008 12:31:08 AM] Joe Flieger:  distance ignoring all other bs in problem
[09/22/2008 12:31:16 AM] Joe Flieger: but ya 
[09/22/2008 12:31:43 AM] Joe Flieger:  i just played connet the dots
[09/22/2008 12:32:30 AM] Joe Flieger:  iono if we got the same one but if we did u can ask me if you got it right
[09/22/2008 12:32:41 AM] Joe Flieger:  5west 6nort 7east
[09/22/2008 12:33:08 AM] bjcullinan: i got it right
[09/22/2008 12:33:12 AM] bjcullinan: not on to 6
[09/22/2008 12:33:14 AM] Joe Flieger: ok 
[09/22/2008 12:33:16 AM] Joe Flieger: now 
[09/22/2008 12:33:23 AM] Joe Flieger: nasty bitch 
[09/22/2008 12:33:43 AM] Joe Flieger:  break each polar into rectangular
[09/22/2008 12:33:54 AM] Joe Flieger: then find the missing part 
[09/22/2008 12:34:03 AM] Joe Flieger:  then covert it backinto polar
[09/22/2008 12:36:19 AM] Joe Flieger:  do you undersand the wording?
[09/22/2008 12:36:28 AM] Joe Flieger: that got me at first 
[09/22/2008 12:37:00 AM] bjcullinan: no idea
[09/22/2008 12:37:07 AM] Joe Flieger: ok 
[09/22/2008 12:37:08 AM] Joe Flieger: so this 
[09/22/2008 12:37:15 AM] bjcullinan: on to adding vectors
[09/22/2008 12:37:15 AM] Joe Flieger: The first has a magnitude of 152 cm and makes an angle of 125° with the positive x axis 
[09/22/2008 12:37:29 AM] Joe Flieger:  thats from pt a to pt b
[09/22/2008 12:37:40 AM] Joe Flieger: The resultant displacement has a magnitude of 136 cm and is directed at an angle of 30.0° to the positive x axis 
[09/22/2008 12:37:52 AM] Joe Flieger:  thats from pt a to pt c
[09/22/2008 12:38:06 AM] Joe Flieger: you have to find pt b to pt c 
[09/22/2008 12:38:19 AM] Joe Flieger:  did that make sence?
[09/22/2008 12:38:25 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/22/2008 12:38:29 AM] Joe Flieger: a is 0,0 
[09/22/2008 12:38:46 AM] Joe Flieger: they gave you a and c and u got to do a + b = c 
[09/22/2008 12:38:57 AM] Joe Flieger: so b = c - a 
[09/22/2008 12:39:05 AM] bjcullinan: i see
[09/22/2008 12:39:27 AM] Joe Flieger: and your answer is in polar 
[09/22/2008 12:39:48 AM] Joe Flieger:  u have to convert to retangular to get b and then back to polar to answer it
[09/22/2008 12:40:00 AM] Joe Flieger: and it say  (counterclockwise from the positive x-axis)
[09/22/2008 12:40:14 AM] Joe Flieger: so my answer for the angel part was like 16 deg 
[09/22/2008 12:40:34 AM] Joe Flieger:  but thats either -16 or +344 from that orientation
[09/22/2008 12:42:41 AM] Joe Flieger:  Brian Cullinan is still in love.
[09/22/2008 12:42:44 AM] Joe Flieger: lolz

[09/22/2008 12:48:33 AM] Joe Flieger: lolz 
[09/22/2008 12:48:35 AM] bjcullinan: y?
[09/22/2008 12:48:40 AM] Joe Flieger: click his image of the chopper 
[09/22/2008 12:48:49 AM] Joe Flieger: u can see a real photo of him 
[09/22/2008 12:48:58 AM] Joe Flieger:  he invited me and im like and u are?
[09/22/2008 12:49:35 AM] Joe Flieger:  isnt he the one that got 2nd in the turny this weekend?
[09/22/2008 12:50:31 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/22/2008 12:50:40 AM] bjcullinan: ) Calculate |a vector - b vector|
[09/22/2008 12:50:48 AM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[09/22/2008 12:50:52 AM] bjcullinan: how?
[09/22/2008 12:50:58 AM] Joe Flieger: i forget 
[09/22/2008 12:51:21 AM] Joe Flieger: um 
[09/22/2008 12:51:33 AM] Joe Flieger:  i think its just suposed to be positive
[09/22/2008 12:52:13 AM] Joe Flieger:  but it something like 4i - 1j and -i -4j=
[09/22/2008 12:52:23 AM] Joe Flieger:  distrubute the -
[09/22/2008 12:52:34 AM] Joe Flieger: so i +4j 
[09/22/2008 12:52:39 AM] Joe Flieger: so 
[09/22/2008 12:52:51 AM] Joe Flieger: 5i +3j 
[09/22/2008 12:53:05 AM] Joe Flieger:  but then im not sure form there let me go look
[09/22/2008 12:54:39 AM] Joe Flieger: then 
[09/22/2008 12:54:44 AM] Joe Flieger:  pathagrians
[09/22/2008 12:55:00 AM] Joe Flieger: c = (a^2 + b^2)^0.5 
[09/22/2008 12:55:28 AM] Joe Flieger: the pipes mean find the hypontnus 
[09/22/2008 12:55:36 AM] bjcullinan: i am just trying to do the |a - b|
[09/22/2008 12:55:43 AM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[09/22/2008 12:55:45 AM] Joe Flieger: so 
[09/22/2008 12:55:52 AM] Joe Flieger: u have answer from b? 
[09/22/2008 12:55:56 AM] Joe Flieger: a - b? 
[09/22/2008 12:56:02 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/22/2008 12:56:12 AM] Joe Flieger: part b = a-b 
[09/22/2008 12:56:12 AM] Joe Flieger: and part d 
[09/22/2008 12:56:19 AM] Joe Flieger:  u just find the hypotnus of it
[09/22/2008 12:56:24 AM] Joe Flieger: so 
[09/22/2008 12:56:26 AM] Joe Flieger: a^2 
[09/22/2008 12:56:28 AM] Joe Flieger: b^2 
[09/22/2008 12:56:34 AM] Joe Flieger: add togeter 
[09/22/2008 12:56:38 AM] Joe Flieger: squareroot 
[09/22/2008 12:56:58 AM] Joe Flieger:  the pipes just mean was the magnatude of this
[09/22/2008 12:57:27 AM] bjcullinan: fuck # 6
[09/22/2008 12:57:41 AM] Joe Flieger: ? 
[09/22/2008 12:57:54 AM] Joe Flieger: its easy if u want me to step you through it 
[09/22/2008 12:57:56 AM] bjcullinan: i don't feel like thinking

[10/12/2008 06:01:39 PM] bjcullinan: how do you select the pivot in 7.1-1
[10/12/2008 06:01:40 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[10/12/2008 06:03:48 PM] Joe Flieger:  very carfuly
[10/12/2008 06:04:04 PM] bjcullinan: but seriously?
[10/12/2008 06:04:36 PM] Joe Flieger:  PARTITION
[10/12/2008 06:04:55 PM] Joe Flieger:  x ← A[r]
[10/12/2008 06:05:12 PM] Joe Flieger:  Figure 7.1 shows the operation of PARTITION on an 8-element array. PARTITION always 
 selects an element x = A[r] as a pivot element around which to partition the subarray A[p ? r].
[10/12/2008 06:05:36 PM] Joe Flieger:  x is the pivot
[10/12/2008 06:05:44 PM] Joe Flieger:  and it = r
[10/12/2008 06:05:53 PM] Joe Flieger:  and r is the last element in the array
[10/12/2008 06:06:18 PM] bjcullinan: so it's always the last element in the array/
[10/12/2008 06:06:19 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[10/12/2008 06:06:44 PM] Joe Flieger:  ya unless you change the way partion works like we talked about in class
[10/12/2008 06:07:03 PM] bjcullinan: do i have to change the way the partition works/
[10/12/2008 06:07:03 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[10/12/2008 06:07:08 PM] Joe Flieger:  no
[10/12/2008 06:07:27 PM] Joe Flieger:  Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A = ?13, 
 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 11, 2, 6, 21?.
[10/12/2008 06:07:29 PM] bjcullinan: everything will be in group 1 in 7.1-1 array
[10/12/2008 06:07:32 PM] Joe Flieger:  it say nothing but do it

[11/19/2008 06:16:07 PM] Joe Flieger: that hop is defenatly phx 
[11/19/2008 06:16:16 PM] Joe Flieger: RIZONA     PHOENIX     GLOBAL CROSSING 
[11/19/2008 06:16:25 PM] Joe Flieger: ARIZONA     PHOENIX     GLOBAL CROSSING 
[11/19/2008 06:16:52 PM] Joe Flieger: i can only guess its due to your isp not beeing local 
[11/19/2008 06:17:25 PM] Joe Flieger: and as u can see its that last hop form phx to you that added 3x ping to your server from flag 
[11/19/2008 06:17:50 PM] Joe Flieger: and its why the pings to your game hosting got so bad 
[11/19/2008 06:17:54 PM] Joe Flieger: im guessing 
[11/19/2008 06:18:41 PM] Joe Flieger: all of them 12's are even phy 
[11/19/2008 06:18:43 PM] Joe Flieger: phx 
[11/19/2008 06:19:05 PM] Joe Flieger: 5th hop through 12th hop is phx 
[11/19/2008 06:19:11 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[11/19/2008 06:19:46 PM] Joe Flieger: thats why i asked u if u know any local or nau ips i could ping 
[11/19/2008 06:20:46 PM] Joe Flieger: most flag websites are in phx or somewheres else due to badwith limits of flag and cooling reasons 
[11/19/2008 06:21:24 PM] Joe Flieger: not even sure why my ip comes up as 10.100.0.1 
[11/19/2008 06:21:45 PM] Joe Flieger: cuz nothing on my network is of that ip or anything close to it 
[11/19/2008 06:22:05 PM] Joe Flieger: i know 10. is reserved for local but i dont have any local like that kinda funny 
[11/19/2008 06:22:43 PM] Joe Flieger: any how just thought u might want to know that 
[11/19/2008 06:22:56 PM] Joe Flieger: or atleast u might think it was intresting

[11/20/2008 10:42:57 AM] bjcullinan: so it being routed to phoenix does matter
[11/20/2008 10:43:07 AM] bjcullinan: but it explains why loading my website is slow
[11/20/2008 10:46:39 AM] Joe Flieger: ip or dns either way its still through phx 
[11/20/2008 10:47:05 AM] bjcullinan: why would IP go through phoenix?
[11/20/2008 10:47:40 AM] Joe Flieger: im guessing cuz ur nub isp is routing all connections to them first and then saying ... hes up in flag

[01/21/2009 06:24:38 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[01/21/2009 06:25:24 PM] Joe Flieger:  i dont i just figured if you really want to know the year you could look at it in the id3 tag
[01/21/2009 06:25:58 PM] bjcullinan: should i put the artist name in the song title, or just have it start with the <track> - <title>?
[01/21/2009 06:32:50 PM] bjcullinan: ???
[01/21/2009 06:34:33 PM] Joe Flieger:  im on the phone borth called
[01/21/2009 06:40:26 PM] Joe Flieger:  i dont know what your asking
[01/21/2009 06:41:06 PM] bjcullinan: should i rename all my songs to 01 - Song name instead of leaving them as Artist - 01 - song name
[01/21/2009 06:41:07 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[01/21/2009 06:41:55 PM] Joe Flieger:  i dont cuz there in folders artist\album\file
[01/21/2009 06:42:04 PM] Joe Flieger: so 
[01/21/2009 06:42:06 PM] Joe Flieger: i just do 
[01/21/2009 06:42:18 PM] Joe Flieger: ## - Title 
[01/21/2009 06:42:34 PM] Joe Flieger: simple short and all the info you might need 
[01/21/2009 06:42:57 PM] Joe Flieger:  and if your that intrested in it then look at the id3 tag for more info
[01/21/2009 06:43:01 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm so i should rename everything
[01/21/2009 06:43:13 PM] Joe Flieger:  personaly i didnt like your convention
[01/21/2009 06:43:18 PM] Joe Flieger: in media players 
[01/21/2009 06:43:25 PM] Joe Flieger: it never uses file name if its taged 
[01/21/2009 06:43:37 PM] bjcullinan: you mean having the artist name?
[01/21/2009 06:44:27 PM] Joe Flieger: and so why have it in the file name of the file if the only time your going to see it is when your browsing the folders and if you browsing folders then you know where u are and u know the artist and album it is in 
[01/21/2009 06:45:17 PM] bjcullinan: can i match file paths with tag and rename?
[01/21/2009 06:45:47 PM] Joe Flieger: i cant think of a case other then having all your files in one folder to have artist info in file name 
[01/21/2009 06:46:00 PM] Joe Flieger: match? 
[01/21/2009 06:46:58 PM] bjcullinan: yeah like i want to match it with a regular expression to remove all the artists
[01/21/2009 06:51:23 PM] Joe Flieger: so i would do a crop before - 
[01/21/2009 06:51:36 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[01/21/2009 06:51:55 PM] Joe Flieger: that would chop off all of you atrsts 
[01/21/2009 06:52:03 PM] Joe Flieger: then do a 
[01/21/2009 06:52:21 PM] Joe Flieger: replace -  with nothing 
[01/21/2009 06:52:41 PM] Joe Flieger:  and i think u can selcet only that which you chaged
[01/21/2009 06:53:30 PM] bjcullinan: not sure how to do this
[01/21/2009 06:55:10 PM] bjcullinan: halp?
[01/21/2009 06:55:17 PM] Joe Flieger:  there all atrist - ## - title?
[01/21/2009 06:55:18 PM] bjcullinan: i could match it with regex
[01/21/2009 06:55:23 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 06:56:50 PM] bjcullinan: the regex will work
[01/21/2009 06:57:09 PM] Joe Flieger:  ok i wouldnt use it just cuz i couldnt figure it out
[01/21/2009 06:57:17 PM] Joe Flieger: but u can do it without it 
[01/21/2009 06:57:24 PM] Joe Flieger: i just did 
[01/21/2009 06:57:26 PM] bjcullinan: i figured it out just fine
[01/21/2009 06:58:57 PM] bjcullinan: that means i am going to have to redo my entire windows media player library
[01/21/2009 06:58:58 PM] Joe Flieger:  cant seem to find the only do it once thing though
[01/21/2009 06:59:18 PM] Joe Flieger:  oh nm u wouldn need it lolz
[01/21/2009 06:59:55 PM] Joe Flieger: ya 
[01/21/2009 07:00:13 PM] Joe Flieger:  but the artist is usless info anyhow
[01/21/2009 07:00:19 PM] Joe Flieger: least in the file name 
[01/21/2009 07:00:27 PM] Joe Flieger: and the other nice thing is 
[01/21/2009 07:00:39 PM] Joe Flieger: you can easily tell when its tagged and when its not 
[01/21/2009 07:00:50 PM] Joe Flieger:  if its tagged theres an artist
[01/21/2009 07:00:51 PM] bjcullinan: i should modify this script so it only matches it once
[01/21/2009 07:01:16 PM] Joe Flieger:  thats why i just did crop before -
[01/21/2009 07:01:29 PM] Joe Flieger:  and then whent back and did remove first 2 chars
[01/21/2009 07:01:38 PM] Joe Flieger:  but ur talking about 309483098 files
[01/21/2009 07:01:51 PM] Joe Flieger: so u might want it to do it in one pass 
[01/21/2009 07:02:21 PM] Joe Flieger:  and i use xx fromat cuz then its the same as the file format
[01/21/2009 07:03:10 PM] bjcullinan: i am going to go through a letter at a time
[01/21/2009 07:03:13 PM] Joe Flieger:  even though it might not be how ya want it i like it cuz its is the same in the tag as the file and you dont have to worie abou stupid shit like omg theres 0's
[01/21/2009 07:04:32 PM] Joe Flieger:  you ever tried winamp?
[01/21/2009 07:08:34 PM] bjcullinan: i like windows media player library the best
[01/21/2009 07:08:57 PM] Joe Flieger:  have u tried winamp?
[01/21/2009 07:09:50 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 07:10:09 PM] Joe Flieger:  check your gmail?
[01/21/2009 07:10:16 PM] bjcullinan: no
[01/21/2009 07:10:25 PM] Joe Flieger: now 
[01/21/2009 07:10:27 PM] Joe Flieger: bish 
[01/21/2009 07:32:04 PM] bjcullinan: i am having some trouble with bulk rename and unicode stuff
[01/21/2009 07:32:25 PM] Joe Flieger: um ok 
[01/21/2009 07:32:54 PM] bjcullinan: does tag and rename support unicode?
[01/21/2009 07:33:47 PM] Joe Flieger: you said it did while i was in your office ? 
[01/21/2009 07:34:05 PM] bjcullinan: in the tag, i mean removing it from the filename
[01/21/2009 07:37:34 PM] Joe Flieger: im not sure what the problem is 
[01/21/2009 07:38:14 PM] bjcullinan: the filename has unicode in it and i can't match that with regex
[01/21/2009 07:39:10 PM] Joe Flieger: you mean like Dj Tiësto 
[01/21/2009 07:39:22 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 07:43:15 PM] bjcullinan: i can't figure out how to make it work with 1 pass
[01/21/2009 07:43:55 PM] Joe Flieger: oh i see 
[01/21/2009 07:44:55 PM] Joe Flieger: u need a ^ 
[01/21/2009 07:44:57 PM] Joe Flieger: so like this 
[01/21/2009 07:45:04 PM] Joe Flieger: [^-] 
[01/21/2009 07:45:07 PM] Joe Flieger: for ur first one 
[01/21/2009 07:45:13 PM] Joe Flieger: that will match all but that 
[01/21/2009 07:45:24 PM] bjcullinan: but the regex is safer
[01/21/2009 07:45:25 PM] Joe Flieger: then u hit that and u got ur break point 
[01/21/2009 07:45:28 PM] Joe Flieger: i know 
[01/21/2009 07:45:33 PM] Joe Flieger: i am talking about regen 
[01/21/2009 07:48:01 PM] Joe Flieger: ^([^-]*) 
[01/21/2009 07:48:12 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i will just go fix the ones it doesn't do
[01/21/2009 07:48:24 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i coded the expression twice already
[01/21/2009 07:48:41 PM] Joe Flieger: if you did that it would only stop on the -'s 
[01/21/2009 07:49:32 PM] Joe Flieger: instead of saying all chars are ok 
[01/21/2009 07:49:43 PM] Joe Flieger: u could just say whatever comesbefore 
[01/21/2009 07:50:06 PM] Joe Flieger: you know you can just rename all ur files with tag&rename based on the id3 tags? 
[01/21/2009 07:53:40 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 07:53:45 PM] bjcullinan: but that takes longer
[01/21/2009 07:53:50 PM] bjcullinan: because it has to read the id3 tags
[01/21/2009 07:53:57 PM] Joe Flieger: ya but it might work better 
[01/21/2009 07:54:00 PM] Joe Flieger:  fuk less up
[01/21/2009 07:54:51 PM] Joe Flieger: wow i just want to drink some wine and pass out to some tv

[07/03/2009 12:36:54 AM] bjcullinan: why does all the tracks in tag & rename show up in pink?
[07/03/2009 12:41:28 AM] Joe Flieger: pink means it has no tags info at all so its going take a while to tag because it has to go back and create the whole header 
[07/03/2009 12:42:09 AM] bjcullinan: no, tag info with pink
[07/03/2009 12:42:14 AM] bjcullinan: there are tags
[07/03/2009 12:42:20 AM] bjcullinan: i think it is the version
[07/03/2009 12:45:30 AM] Joe Flieger: soon as i tag pink files they change to green/white 
[07/03/2009 12:46:15 AM] bjcullinan: yeah but if it is only v1 and doesn't need to be changed, it will stay red
[07/03/2009 12:46:43 AM] Joe Flieger: doesnt it auto v2 
[07/03/2009 12:46:45 AM] bjcullinan: and why doesn't the search results show up when it is done?
[07/03/2009 12:46:51 AM] bjcullinan: its supposed to
[07/03/2009 12:48:26 AM] Joe Flieger: search results of what? 
[07/03/2009 12:48:37 AM] bjcullinan: the search in explorer
[07/03/2009 12:49:18 AM] Joe Flieger: so when u tag files there not longer search able in explorer? 
[07/03/2009 12:49:31 AM] bjcullinan: no, nvm
[07/03/2009 12:49:48 AM] bjcullinan: do you think windows search will handle 30,000 files?
[07/03/2009 12:49:59 AM] Joe Flieger: handle? 
[07/03/2009 12:50:12 AM] bjcullinan: ok, the search in explorer doesn't show how many files it has found
[07/03/2009 12:50:19 AM] Joe Flieger: it will take a while to search but i dont see why there would be a upper limit to it 
[07/03/2009 12:53:30 AM] Joe Flieger: wow on vista search is hard limited to 5000
