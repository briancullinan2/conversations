[05/28/2008 02:05:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: "i do call you a bitch to sean sometimes though
but thats sean so he understands

[05/28/2008 04:23:21 PM] bjcullinan: oh it clears the save everytime you search
[05/28/2008 04:23:26 PM] bjcullinan: still working on that

[05/30/2008 01:05:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: I owe you
[05/30/2008 01:05:43 PM] bjcullinan: owe me?
[05/30/2008 01:05:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: owe you
[05/30/2008 01:05:52 PM] bjcullinan: how so?
[05/30/2008 01:06:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: for fucking with your game club, slagcore, abe opportunity
[05/30/2008 01:06:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: especially if you coulda gotten money working for abe
[05/30/2008 01:06:51 PM] bjcullinan: potentially
[05/30/2008 01:06:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz i doubt it's gonna happen
[05/30/2008 01:07:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: therefore, i owe you.
[05/30/2008 01:07:23 PM] bjcullinan: but there is no way to change it
[05/30/2008 01:07:26 PM] bjcullinan: so w/e
[05/30/2008 01:07:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: I will be right back
[05/30/2008 01:08:16 PM] bjcullinan: you don't owe me anything
[05/30/2008 01:08:22 PM] bjcullinan: everyone in the group owes me
[05/30/2008 01:08:32 PM] bjcullinan: more respect and consideration then what they gave
[05/30/2008 01:08:42 PM] bjcullinan: Leah said it was steve's "consolation prize"
[05/30/2008 01:09:52 PM] bjcullinan: they owe me because they are the assholes that let something personal interfere with other peoples lives and the professional environment
[05/30/2008 01:10:00 PM] bjcullinan: steve owe's me
[05/30/2008 01:10:31 PM] bjcullinan: for telling everyone, and making people choose sides when the fight was between him and I
[05/30/2008 01:10:38 PM] bjcullinan: so w/e
[05/30/2008 01:18:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm back
[05/30/2008 01:18:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry to bring that shit up again.
[05/30/2008 01:31:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: babe!
[05/30/2008 01:31:39 PM] bjcullinan: whats up?
[05/30/2008 01:33:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are amazing in my eyes, and i apologize for saying things last night that could have made you think otherwise. I'd like us to be okay with sharing things on our minds with eachother even if it's not what the other wants to hear.
[05/30/2008 01:33:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am glad we have been able to be so open and honest with eachother, and it really makes me confident that we can make it.
[05/30/2008 01:34:41 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[05/30/2008 01:35:59 PM] bjcullinan: and i don't want to discourage you from telling me stuff just because i got upset, but i said a lot of stuff that i wanted to, and i don't think there was any other right time to say it
[05/30/2008 01:36:32 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[05/30/2008 01:36:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: From what i heard in your voice, it sounded like i hurt you. [2008/05/30 13:36:05]
[05/30/2008 01:37:41 PM] bjcullinan: i am just sad when you are sad, and about the well rounded thing, we just don't know each other's history enough to make that kind of judgment 
[05/30/2008 01:37:48 PM] bjcullinan: and you didn't, you were just speculating
[05/30/2008 01:38:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: speculating! yes.
[05/30/2008 01:38:11 PM] bjcullinan: i did a lot of band in highschool
[05/30/2008 01:38:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: band!
[05/30/2008 01:38:24 PM] bjcullinan: i was pretty in to music until i got up here
[05/30/2008 01:38:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: college changes things
[05/30/2008 01:38:50 PM] bjcullinan: college kind of ruined it for me, because marching band that i spent at least 20 hours a week on, was only 1 credit
[05/30/2008 01:39:09 PM] bjcullinan: i sacrificed all of my satrudays at football games for 1 credit
[05/30/2008 01:39:19 PM] bjcullinan: it just wasn't worth it to me anymore
[05/30/2008 01:39:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: I took a singing class for a day in college, but i just felt it wasnt work just one credit. eh. kind of regret never doing it though, I liked singing. Did i mention i was in choir! i dont think i did
[05/30/2008 01:39:43 PM] bjcullinan: but in highschool there was one semester that i was in 2 hours of band
[05/30/2008 01:40:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: one semester
[05/30/2008 01:40:08 PM] bjcullinan: choir is awesome
[05/30/2008 01:40:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: and the otherS?
[05/30/2008 01:40:17 PM] bjcullinan: i did just 1 hour of band
[05/30/2008 01:40:23 PM] bjcullinan: every semester in highschool
[05/30/2008 01:40:40 PM] bjcullinan: except for senior year i did 2, and learned how to play concert tuba
[05/30/2008 01:40:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: marching band right?
[05/30/2008 01:40:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: or concert band
[05/30/2008 01:40:58 PM] bjcullinan: we had marching band in the fall, and concert band in the spring
[05/30/2008 01:41:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: you mean 1 and 2 hrs a day
[05/30/2008 01:41:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[05/30/2008 01:41:15 PM] bjcullinan: and senior year during concert band i took 2 band classes
[05/30/2008 01:41:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh cool
[05/30/2008 01:41:28 PM] bjcullinan: because they split them up into the "good" band and the "bad" band
[05/30/2008 01:41:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[05/30/2008 01:41:34 PM] bjcullinan: and i did tuba in the bad band
[05/30/2008 01:41:42 PM] bjcullinan: i played trumpet all throughout highschool
[05/30/2008 01:41:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: cute!
[05/30/2008 01:41:54 PM] bjcullinan: and i got pretty good
[05/30/2008 01:42:03 PM] bjcullinan: but up here i didn't have as much fun
[05/30/2008 01:42:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: understandable
[05/30/2008 01:42:53 PM] bjcullinan: and i think that was in part due to having a band sorority and band fraternity, i think it really divides the band into more distinct social groups, and drama constantly pours out of them
[05/30/2008 01:43:23 PM] bjcullinan: i didn't want to be apart of that, but it made participating in the band more difficult
[05/30/2008 01:44:15 PM] bjcullinan: i used to play basketball, and run track in middle school
[05/30/2008 01:44:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, there was definitely drama in my apt from sorority stuff, and most of us weren't even in a sorority, we just had some sorority friends, and meghan was in pi phi.
[05/30/2008 01:44:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw track in middle school
[05/30/2008 01:44:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: me too!
[05/30/2008 01:44:54 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[05/30/2008 01:45:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: what'd you run?
[05/30/2008 01:46:57 PM] bjcullinan: prints
[05/30/2008 01:47:00 PM] bjcullinan: sprints
[05/30/2008 01:47:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha hot.

[05/30/2008 01:47:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was one mile, two mile, 4x800
[05/30/2008 01:47:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: tried long jump a couple times, but i didn't really like it
[05/30/2008 01:47:43 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[05/30/2008 01:53:34 PM] bjcullinan: man this templating system is hot
[05/30/2008 01:54:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: can't wait to see =)

[05/30/2008 02:02:10 PM] bjcullinan: thanks babe
[05/30/2008 02:02:12 PM] bjcullinan: you too!
[05/30/2008 02:02:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: good things take time, but really great things happen in a blink of an eye
[05/30/2008 02:03:45 PM] bjcullinan: but that really means there are over 6 and a half thousand other people out there like me
[05/30/2008 02:04:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: nuh uh!
[05/30/2008 02:04:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: chances of meeting someone like you is a million to one.
[05/30/2008 02:04:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorta quoting miley, but that's how i feel
[05/30/2008 02:04:58 PM] bjcullinan: hmm
[05/30/2008 02:06:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: Life was so scattered when I met you. Before I could even fully process what was going on, I was falling in love, and it happened so fast.
[05/30/2008 02:11:48 PM] bjcullinan: i see
[05/30/2008 02:16:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's not a bad thign
[05/30/2008 02:17:15 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[05/30/2008 02:17:20 PM] bjcullinan: i guess not

[06/02/2008 05:12:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: It would be nice to have a laptop for Florida
[06/02/2008 05:13:07 PM] bjcullinan: yeeah
[06/02/2008 05:13:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe i can find a nice one at Costco or circuit city or best buy?
[06/02/2008 05:15:11 PM] bjcullinan: best buy is probably your best bet
[06/02/2008 05:16:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: Steve thinks i should get a custom Dell.
[06/02/2008 05:16:40 PM] bjcullinan: i disagree, but whatever you think would be best for you
[06/02/2008 05:17:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz of the customer service and the fact that he thinks ACER isnt good.
[06/02/2008 05:17:58 PM] bjcullinan: what experience does he have with acer?
[06/02/2008 05:18:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: well none i guess
[06/02/2008 05:18:24 PM] bjcullinan: dells customer service is a pain in the ass for the typical consumer
[06/02/2008 05:18:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: or maybe it was the warranty
[06/02/2008 05:19:06 PM] bjcullinan: you can buy extra years of warrenty from the retailer
[06/02/2008 05:19:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: in my opinion, I thought it was weird that i could only get the ACER I wanted at retail stores I have never heard of and on online stores that seemed shady
[06/02/2008 05:19:16 PM] bjcullinan: and acer should have a 2 year warrent
[06/02/2008 05:19:19 PM] bjcullinan: *warrenty
[06/02/2008 05:19:22 PM] bjcullinan: at least
[06/02/2008 05:20:07 PM] bjcullinan: ah, it says parts and labor 1 year warrenty
[06/02/2008 05:20:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm sorry, this is weird and strange and difficult to talk about, because I used to always just do whatever Steve thought was best
[06/02/2008 05:20:57 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[06/02/2008 05:21:20 PM] bjcullinan: well i have had many laptops in my time
[06/02/2008 05:21:44 PM] bjcullinan: and i've worked for resnet, constantly fixing people's computers
[06/02/2008 05:22:09 PM] bjcullinan: and i know that dell comes with the worst preinstalled software, and has quickly depreciating hardware
[06/02/2008 05:23:01 PM] bjcullinan: and their customer service are novice (for normal consumers), and their general hardware is bulky
[06/02/2008 05:23:09 PM] bjcullinan: so now you have my opinion
[06/02/2008 05:24:45 PM] bjcullinan: I had an acer and loved it, ryan has had 2 acers and loved them, i had a few thinkpads now owned by lenova, and they lasted forever and most business give out thinkpads, the sony is great and have always been reliable but my sony is just too big
[06/02/2008 05:25:17 PM] bjcullinan: so there are 3 brands with a more credible opinion
[06/02/2008 05:25:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[06/02/2008 05:29:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: thank you
[06/02/2008 05:40:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: Are you more Daft or more Punk?
[06/02/2008 05:40:17 PM] bjcullinan: neither
[06/02/2008 05:41:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw
[06/02/2008 05:44:46 PM] bjcullinan: why aw?
[06/02/2008 05:44:59 PM] bjcullinan: i am not mentally irregular, and i am definitely not punk
[06/02/2008 05:45:09 PM] bjcullinan: i can't stand hot topic
[06/02/2008 05:45:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay.
[06/02/2008 05:45:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wasn't being literal
[06/02/2008 05:48:11 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[06/02/2008 05:48:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: I shopped at hot topic when i was a kid in high school.
[06/02/2008 05:51:46 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[06/02/2008 05:51:49 PM] bjcullinan: most people did
[06/02/2008 05:51:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[06/02/2008 05:53:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I feel like there is something I'm feeling that I am not telling you about, but I don't know what it is.
[06/02/2008 05:55:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: Like there is something different about us that I can't put my finger on, but it's not a very good thing. 
[06/02/2008 05:55:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am just going to go home now, I'll talk to you later.
[06/02/2008 05:56:51 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[06/02/2008 05:56:53 PM] bjcullinan: ttyl
[06/02/2008 05:56:57 PM] bjcullinan: i love you!
[06/02/2008 05:57:03 PM] bjcullinan: drive safe

[06/04/2008 08:14:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: My baby love is sleeping peacefully
[06/04/2008 08:52:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: On you server, I am trying to search for stuff in the genre Soundtrack, but i dont know how to make it just give me everything with that genre, so i put soundtrack in the Contains... maybe you can tell me if there is a better way, unless all your soundtracks have the work soundtrack in it, then my problem is solved
[06/04/2008 08:54:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: Looks like someone needs more soundtracks! =)
[06/04/2008 08:56:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: Crystal has over a hundred, you can ask her for some
[06/04/2008 08:57:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: if you care, cuz i know if you had them on your server i would listen to them from your server whenever convenient
[06/04/2008 09:00:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: it not ordering by genre =(
[06/04/2008 09:02:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: I put hot chocolate in my coffee to make it bareable
[06/04/2008 09:05:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: I need to figure out how to really reset it, because now it keeps everything i've searched for and saved earlier today
[06/04/2008 09:05:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: you said you wanted ideas =)
[06/04/2008 09:05:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay back to work
[06/04/2008 09:15:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: yay! you have Pirates!

[06/04/2008 10:19:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm ten times happier now
[06/04/2008 10:19:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: i know huh, geeze
[06/04/2008 10:23:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: I am now only nine times as happy, cuz you aren't saying anything
[06/04/2008 10:24:33 AM] bjcullinan: ten times happier?
[06/04/2008 10:24:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: ten times happier.
[06/04/2008 10:24:58 AM] bjcullinan: so you change it to Audio, Contained soundtrack, an rder by Genre
[06/04/2008 10:25:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: i pressed refresh and now there is a bunch of stuff on top that I am not supposed to be seeing
[06/04/2008 10:26:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: did you forget to close something?
[06/04/2008 10:27:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: Why are you up so early?
[06/04/2008 10:27:49 AM] bjcullinan: i am working on it
[06/04/2008 10:28:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: I assumed such things
[06/04/2008 10:28:24 AM] bjcullinan: weird
[06/04/2008 10:28:28 AM] bjcullinan: genre is blank
[06/04/2008 10:29:07 AM] bjcullinan: if you ever see errors like missing fields
[06/04/2008 10:29:09 AM] bjcullinan: you should tell me
[06/04/2008 10:29:13 AM] bjcullinan: so i can go fix the files
[06/04/2008 10:29:39 AM] bjcullinan: i am going out to lunch with colin
[06/04/2008 10:30:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: So it's not really an error, it's just that you havent set that file to have a genre for instance?
[06/04/2008 10:30:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: lunch with colin! cool.
[06/04/2008 10:30:32 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[06/04/2008 10:31:03 AM] bjcullinan: usually i go through windows media plays unknown section and fix them
[06/04/2008 10:31:09 AM] bjcullinan: so i will do that later today
[06/04/2008 10:31:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[06/04/2008 10:31:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: you told me to "change it to Audio, Contained soundtrack, an rder by Genre "
[06/04/2008 10:31:53 AM] bjcullinan: and i always encourage people to put music on my server, if you could fix some on a flash drive or dvd, or i can give you an ftp address to upload to
[06/04/2008 10:32:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: but wouldnt that only bring up files with file paths containing the word "soundtrack"?
[06/04/2008 10:32:00 AM] bjcullinan: then you cant access it from work
[06/04/2008 10:32:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: like stardust for instance doesnt contain soundtrack
[06/04/2008 10:32:31 AM] bjcullinan: no it brings up any field containing the word soundtrack
[06/04/2008 10:32:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh, well then maybe it just doesnt have a genre
[06/04/2008 10:33:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: show me how to upload when I'm home, and you're home
[06/04/2008 10:33:16 AM] bjcullinan: ok
[06/04/2008 10:34:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: thanks
[06/04/2008 10:35:03 AM] bjcullinan: fuck i am missing tracks too
[06/04/2008 10:35:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: your Sunshine soundtrack doesnt seem right
[06/04/2008 10:35:36 AM] bjcullinan: why?
[06/04/2008 10:35:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: like if you compare to what Amazon has, you only have 7 tracks, but thats something you can deal with later if you care
[06/04/2008 10:36:28 AM] bjcullinan: i think there are multiple versions of the cd
[06/04/2008 10:36:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: i have like 20
[06/04/2008 10:36:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think one is a fake.
[06/04/2008 10:36:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: or maybe there are multiples
[06/04/2008 10:36:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: ill listen to it, see whats up
[06/04/2008 10:37:11 AM] bjcullinan: who is it by?

[06/04/2008 10:53:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: Okay
[06/04/2008 10:53:50 AM] bjcullinan: but the sunshine album is really helpful
[06/04/2008 10:53:54 AM] bjcullinan: thanks for letting me know
[06/04/2008 10:54:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: You are welcome
[06/04/2008 10:54:20 AM] bjcullinan: i just assumed it was like the bladerunner album
[06/04/2008 10:54:25 AM] bjcullinan: with the voices from the movie
[06/04/2008 10:54:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: I know it was floating around out there because I almost downloaded, but then I read the comments as I usually do
[06/04/2008 10:54:34 AM] bjcullinan: or the oceans 11 album
[06/04/2008 10:54:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, well the sound is terrible too
[06/04/2008 10:55:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: I have to go potty, but maybe you will be home for my daily lunch phone call?
[06/04/2008 10:55:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: like 12:40
[06/04/2008 10:57:09 AM] bjcullinan: i should be done by then

[06/18/2008 07:31:04 AM] bjcullinan: i am glad that you brought it up this morning
[06/18/2008 07:31:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: for a moment there i didn't know if it was okay 
[06/18/2008 07:32:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: because it makes me feel like a broken record
[06/18/2008 07:32:08 AM] bjcullinan: because i had the opportunity to tell you that i am completely committed to us, and i will always stick by you, and honor whatever decisions you make in life.
[06/18/2008 07:32:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: and i feel dumb for not knowing where my warranty is to get free new lenses for my glasses instead of getting contacts
[06/18/2008 07:32:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: well that is very nice of you to say
[06/18/2008 07:35:15 AM] bjcullinan: and i kind of have 2 ways of admiring a woman
[06/18/2008 07:35:33 AM] bjcullinan: saying she is pretty or attractive, is different from saying she is hot
[06/18/2008 07:35:42 AM] bjcullinan: and some women try to just look hot
[06/18/2008 07:37:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: i see, perhaps we will catch on to what my boundaries are with time, but I wouldnt say I am a jealous girlfriend
[06/18/2008 07:37:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: well i could be a healthy jealous
[06/18/2008 07:37:46 AM] bjcullinan: so i have to reassure you
[06/18/2008 07:38:56 AM] bjcullinan: no one is more attractive to me, then you are. when i am not around you, i am completely blind to other women, usually outside of a relationship i would have the radar on
[06/18/2008 07:39:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: a healthy reassure
[06/18/2008 07:39:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha radar
[06/18/2008 07:39:16 AM] bjcullinan: :-D
[06/18/2008 07:39:34 AM] bjcullinan: but since i have you, the radar is turned off all the time
[06/18/2008 07:41:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think my radar turned on sometime in the second to last semester of school and stayed on
[06/18/2008 07:41:43 AM] bjcullinan: radar for women?
[06/18/2008 07:41:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[06/18/2008 07:41:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[06/18/2008 07:41:52 AM] bjcullinan: hot
[06/18/2008 07:41:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[06/18/2008 07:41:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[06/18/2008 07:41:56 AM] bjcullinan: lol
[06/18/2008 07:41:59 AM] bjcullinan: hahahaha
[06/18/2008 07:42:05 AM] bjcullinan: radar for men?
[06/18/2008 07:42:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think ill stay with slightly scratched lenses
[06/18/2008 07:42:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry for having two conversations at once
[06/18/2008 07:42:34 AM] bjcullinan: oh
[06/18/2008 07:42:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: radar for males yes
[06/18/2008 07:42:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: and it got worse and worse
[06/18/2008 07:42:50 AM] bjcullinan: so your radar doesn't go off when you are in a relationship?
[06/18/2008 07:43:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: I mean it stayed on until you. It was on because i wasnt happy with steve or something
[06/18/2008 07:43:37 AM] bjcullinan: i see
[06/18/2008 07:43:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: now its off :-)
[06/18/2008 07:43:49 AM] bjcullinan: yeah that happened to me with my last girlfriend
[06/18/2008 07:44:30 AM] bjcullinan: but you have to realize you will still discover things about those other people that won't be perfect, even though they look perfect from the outside
[06/18/2008 07:45:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: It's true
[06/18/2008 07:45:52 AM] bjcullinan: if you knew about this skin irritation i have been having, although temporary, it probably would have been pretty discouraging if you found out from the start
[06/18/2008 07:47:00 AM] bjcullinan: i keep sneaking up on diane
[06/18/2008 07:47:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i say it's true, but i havent seen that as the case with you, yeah you have physical and personality flaws but it never changes the way i feel about you
[06/18/2008 07:47:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[06/18/2008 07:48:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: the skin irritation doesn't bother me, and i doubt it would have if you had told me even before us
[06/18/2008 07:48:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: i should concentrate on work, but you can IM me after the grocery store and maybe i could take a break
[06/18/2008 07:49:10 AM] bjcullinan: it bothers me, some days it feels like it is going away and other days it is bad, it is so annoying
[06/18/2008 07:49:17 AM] bjcullinan: ok ttyl
[06/18/2008 07:49:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: it really looks like you are running out of the jelly stuff, but you just need to keep putting on lotion right after showering no matter how annoying it is, i know i dont like to put on lotion
[06/18/2008 07:50:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: ttyl

[06/22/2008 03:15:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[06/22/2008 03:15:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think black could make me look too white
[06/22/2008 03:15:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: red might be too daring, but i might get the white dirty
[06/22/2008 03:16:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: or i could not get it
[06/22/2008 03:17:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[06/22/2008 03:17:21 PM] bjcullinan: black won't make you look too white!
[06/22/2008 03:17:52 PM] bjcullinan: and if it makes you look lighter, that is sexy too
[06/22/2008 03:18:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you keep records of your cars checkups and fixes?
[06/22/2008 03:18:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm

[06/22/2008 03:19:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have a folder, so i guess i might as well just add them to it
[06/22/2008 03:19:03 PM] bjcullinan: you should go out of a limb and get the red
[06/22/2008 03:19:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: I like when The Office makes me laugh out loud, cuz even though its a funny show, a laugh out loud is kind of rare when I am alone

[06/23/2008 10:47:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i like the white one on the black chick cuz it has the most coverage

[06/23/2008 03:48:08 PM] bjcullinan: that sucks
[06/23/2008 03:49:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i've lost some integrity particularly out of spite that they dont have enough stuff for me to do so instead of fuck around here i go home, and also because Lauren is kind of laxadasical about charging time and money and she sorta rubbed it off on me
[06/23/2008 03:53:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill probably come in at 7 and leave at 5 on wednesday so i can stay till like 645

[06/23/2008 04:25:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: I guess i should set it to something simple so other people can use it too
[06/23/2008 04:26:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: but when you put it on your computer it installs it as a Kingston DTSecure Privacy USB device and you need to restart the comp the first time so it recognizes it

[07/08/2008 09:38:58 AM] bjcullinan: i got stuck next to annoying kids on the plane to seattle
[07/08/2008 09:39:18 AM] bjcullinan: and this one kid looks like he was about 3 years old, he was pretty big
[07/08/2008 09:39:23 AM] bjcullinan: he wouldn't stop screaming
[07/08/2008 09:39:36 AM] bjcullinan: he just wanted to go back and forth between parents and get attention
[07/08/2008 09:40:03 AM] bjcullinan: and his mom was doing this stupid floaty dance all across the aisle rocking him to sleep or calm down
[07/08/2008 09:40:27 AM] bjcullinan: and i couldn't help but think about what was going through the child's head psychologically
[07/08/2008 09:40:51 AM] bjcullinan: i mean if you always do a floaty dance to get them to calm down, then anything less then that will never work
[07/08/2008 09:41:23 AM] bjcullinan: because they will be used to the floaty dance, but if you just rock them gently sitting or standing then they will be used to that instead
[07/08/2008 09:42:00 AM] bjcullinan: i just think the mother looked pretty stupid, she kind of reminded me of that outcast chearleader that smoked, because she has horrible skin and she was blonde
[07/08/2008 09:44:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha your funny
[07/08/2008 09:44:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah you always gotta watch out for that sort of thing, like babies getting used to stuff
[07/08/2008 09:45:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: My sister is used to needing a bottle of milk before she will sleep, and she is supposed to be off it by now.
[07/08/2008 09:46:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: My sister's baby is used to carrying around her blanket all the time, and cries if she doesn't have it.
[07/08/2008 09:46:22 AM] bjcullinan: yeah stuff like that, i think it takes a lot of research and knowledge raising a child
[07/08/2008 09:46:36 AM] bjcullinan: and some people just read the baby books which totally don't have enough information
[07/08/2008 09:46:55 AM] bjcullinan: i think if i were a parent i would read studies on that sort of stuff
[07/08/2008 09:47:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: My mom was joking about it, so my sister had a blanket and stuffed animal in her hand, and my mom grabbed the blanket and threw it across the room and then grabbed the stuffed lion named Kokiko and threw it, and my sister just laughed
[07/08/2008 09:47:19 AM] bjcullinan: but i guess everyone wants to have the perfect child that never misbehaves
[07/08/2008 09:47:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: who has time for studies when the baby is crying!
[07/08/2008 09:47:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: but yeah i get what you mean
[07/08/2008 09:47:56 AM] bjcullinan: but on the other hand our generation is the most wired then ever before and information is easily accessed.
[07/08/2008 09:48:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's true
[07/08/2008 09:48:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: I feel useless here, but I feel useless over at Rita Rd in my office, so might as well get the change of scenary
[07/08/2008 09:49:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: we were lucky to be born at the time we were.
[07/08/2008 09:50:15 AM] bjcullinan: yeah totally
[07/08/2008 09:50:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: but any time after this would be cool cuz they are coming out with more and more cool tech
[07/08/2008 09:51:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: Did you get any chocolate? I am saving it in my fridge.
[07/08/2008 09:53:17 AM] bjcullinan: you should eat it!
[07/08/2008 09:53:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay!
[07/08/2008 09:53:49 AM] bjcullinan: we should get chocolate covered bunanas and strawberries when i come to visit you
[07/08/2008 09:55:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha i'll have to figure out where we can get some
[07/08/2008 09:55:38 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/08/2008 09:55:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[07/08/2008 09:56:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: ever notice how i match you sometimes, body language wise?
[07/08/2008 09:59:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: i love taking showers with you, and now we know what we physically can and can't do.
[07/08/2008 10:03:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: Chocolate covered bananas! Santa Barbary Ice Creamery and The Cereal Boxx are two places i found. Both sound cool
[07/08/2008 10:08:28 AM] bjcullinan: physically can and can't do?
[07/08/2008 10:08:54 AM] bjcullinan: you know even though we spend a lot of time in different positions and some of them don't get me off, i still really enjoy them
[07/08/2008 10:09:01 AM] bjcullinan: just being close to you like that
[07/08/2008 10:09:18 AM] bjcullinan: being close to you is what really gets me off
[07/08/2008 10:17:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: Did you notice me get off any faster when you were talking to me, i really like it!
[07/08/2008 10:18:24 AM] bjcullinan: yeah, use your imagination! i am telling you it works
[07/08/2008 10:18:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: thanks brian

[07/08/2008 04:38:10 PM] bjcullinan: and it still itches in some places

[07/11/2008 02:12:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: When we are together I want to take as much of you in as I possibly can. You know what i mean? I want to kiss you so hard and hold you so tight, because I know I won't have it for a long while after I leave again. It may come off that I am very physical and sexual but it's more than that.
[07/11/2008 02:13:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: You are perfect for me
[07/11/2008 03:19:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: I hope you didnt have any aspirations to see Get Smart with me, cuz a friend at work wants to see that movie and i think it's a good idea to hang out and actually have a friend.

[07/11/2008 08:37:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: brought lunch for some reason, knowing it would be provided at the meeting

[07/11/2008 08:38:33 PM] bjcullinan: that's good
[07/11/2008 08:40:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: my friend Che asked if i wanted to go to the movies so I got all psyched about it, but then he told me he meant saturday so i had already lost all my motivation to stay at work, so i left early anyway
[07/11/2008 08:40:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: Yesterday I got a job where I was given change request notices and i was told to put all the basic information into a spreadsheet
[07/11/2008 08:40:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: So that is what i plan to do tomorrow, because the Phx thing is no longer happening
[07/11/2008 08:40:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just found out.
[07/11/2008 08:40:52 PM] bjcullinan: the phx thing?
[07/11/2008 08:40:57 PM] bjcullinan: i am a little lost
[07/11/2008 08:41:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: which sucks because I never really got to say goodbye to anyone from my group of friends from college
[07/11/2008 08:41:06 PM] bjcullinan: how did you end up going out with sean again?
[07/11/2008 08:41:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: not talking to you must be throwing me off
[07/11/2008 08:41:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: yesterday sean told me that karan and kristen wanted to celebrate their birthdays with us and other friends
[07/11/2008 08:41:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: and they are all in phx

[07/11/2008 08:42:32 PM] bjcullinan: it is not happening
[07/11/2008 08:42:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: that was supposed to happen tomorrow, then spending the night there at KELLY's and then driving home sunday
[07/11/2008 08:42:38 PM] bjcullinan: i get it now
[07/11/2008 08:42:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: but people backed down or whatever
[07/11/2008 08:43:13 PM] bjcullinan: i see
[07/11/2008 08:43:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: and it would have been a bad idea for me to go anyway since i still have so much to do before you get here

[07/11/2008 08:43:23 PM] bjcullinan: yeah

[07/11/2008 08:44:27 PM] bjcullinan: what time is the movie?
[07/11/2008 08:44:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: They also have me putting together a document that summarizes the important parameters that the tomahawk missile spits out after a test, since there';s like thousands, i need to ask different people which are the most useful

[07/11/2008 08:56:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i like to think about it

[07/11/2008 08:58:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[07/11/2008 08:58:34 PM] bjcullinan: i have talked to jessica a little
[07/11/2008 08:58:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: (Link: http://www.facebook.com/wall.php?id=21561857060#/event.php?eid=21561857060)http://www.facebook.com/wall.php?id=21561857060#/event.php?eid=21561857060
[07/11/2008 08:58:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh really?
[07/11/2008 08:58:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: about?!
[07/11/2008 08:58:52 PM] bjcullinan: but i was thinking if we were really serious about a 3 way we should have someone else in mind
[07/11/2008 08:58:59 PM] bjcullinan: and i really like to think about it too
[07/11/2008 08:59:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you mean, like a back up? or someone else entirely?
[07/11/2008 08:59:58 PM] bjcullinan: it already passed
[07/11/2008 09:00:08 PM] bjcullinan: a back up like with someone else
[07/11/2008 09:00:17 PM] bjcullinan: because she was injured
[07/11/2008 09:00:23 PM] bjcullinan: and is in physical therapy
[07/11/2008 09:00:31 PM] bjcullinan: and hasn't gotten her leave yet
[07/11/2008 09:01:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh i thoguht it was july
[07/11/2008 09:01:32 PM] bjcullinan: says june
[07/11/2008 09:01:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: i realize that now
[07/11/2008 09:01:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry
[07/11/2008 09:02:21 PM] bjcullinan: or another idea...?
[07/11/2008 09:02:27 PM] bjcullinan: or am i the only creative one?
[07/11/2008 09:02:32 PM] bjcullinan: i know that isn't true
[07/11/2008 09:02:37 PM] bjcullinan: think of something
[07/11/2008 09:02:39 PM] bjcullinan: !
[07/11/2008 09:02:48 PM] bjcullinan: lets be adventurous
[07/11/2008 09:02:52 PM] bjcullinan: and ridiculous
[07/11/2008 09:02:58 PM] bjcullinan: and maybe a little immature
[07/11/2008 09:03:01 PM] bjcullinan: while we still can
[07/11/2008 09:03:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[07/11/2008 09:03:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just feel that we are so restrained with our long distance situation
[07/11/2008 09:04:40 PM] bjcullinan: it limits the frequency of having too much fun sexually, not the quality or quantity of fun we can have
[07/11/2008 09:05:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: true
[07/11/2008 09:05:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant talk now
[07/11/2008 09:05:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: have to get ready
[07/11/2008 09:05:16 PM] bjcullinan: ok sounds good
[07/11/2008 09:05:18 PM] bjcullinan: i will talk
[07/11/2008 09:05:51 PM] bjcullinan: the more i think about you, the more comfortable i become with the idea of inviting someone else into the bedroom
[07/11/2008 09:06:29 PM] bjcullinan: i can't be sure of this, but i think that having someone else admire your body will make me even more attracted and in love with you
[07/11/2008 09:07:00 PM] bjcullinan: so i have been thinking about how the experience might plan out a little bit
[07/11/2008 09:07:31 PM] bjcullinan: and it really turns me on thinking of another woman kissing you or going down on you, and you doing the same to them

[07/13/2008 11:41:07 AM] bjcullinan: i liked that one morning you came to wake me up
[07/13/2008 11:41:13 AM] bjcullinan: when i was on the air mattress
[07/13/2008 11:41:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh yeah!
[07/13/2008 11:41:20 AM] bjcullinan: and you put your hands in my boxers

[07/13/2008 11:41:56 AM] bjcullinan: and i love waking up next to you naked, but i guess i never really touched you in the morning
[07/13/2008 11:42:04 AM] bjcullinan: from being unsure if you'd like it
[07/13/2008 11:42:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: ya i did say something about that and my last boyfriend
[07/13/2008 11:42:51 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2008 11:43:13 AM] bjcullinan: but you also made it sound like it was all the time, and all night long
[07/13/2008 11:43:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe, i just didnt like him.
[07/13/2008 11:44:12 AM] bjcullinan: but i guess that's why i don't try to cuddle up close to you when you are asleep
[07/13/2008 11:44:17 AM] bjcullinan: i wouldn't want to wake you
[07/13/2008 11:44:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe, i just didnt like him

[07/13/2008 12:34:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I love that game
[07/13/2008 12:34:36 PM] bjcullinan: you would tell me if i do something wrong right?
[07/13/2008 12:34:43 PM] bjcullinan: like being to sexual
[07/13/2008 12:34:56 PM] bjcullinan: or wanting to do something that you don't
[07/13/2008 12:35:24 PM] bjcullinan: you don't have to keep things from me just to keep me blissfully ignorant
[07/13/2008 12:36:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: where is this coming from
[07/13/2008 12:36:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: you should yell at me for being a loser
[07/13/2008 12:36:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean.. lazy
[07/13/2008 12:36:39 PM] bjcullinan: stop being lazy!
[07/13/2008 12:36:44 PM] bjcullinan: i do it sometimes too
[07/13/2008 12:36:49 PM] bjcullinan: but when i come to visit
[07/13/2008 12:36:55 PM] bjcullinan: i'm not going to put up with it
[07/13/2008 12:37:01 PM] bjcullinan: we are going running in the morning
[07/13/2008 12:37:10 PM] bjcullinan: and we are going to find a gym
[07/13/2008 12:37:13 PM] bjcullinan: :-P
[07/13/2008 12:37:19 PM] bjcullinan: together!
[07/13/2008 12:37:23 PM] bjcullinan: like it should be
[07/13/2008 12:37:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh geeze
[07/13/2008 12:37:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha okay
[07/13/2008 12:37:42 PM] bjcullinan: so back to what i was saying
[07/13/2008 12:37:46 PM] bjcullinan: i was talking to ryan
[07/13/2008 12:37:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: and
[07/13/2008 12:37:53 PM] bjcullinan: you ever talk to someone dating and ex?
[07/13/2008 12:38:01 PM] bjcullinan: you learn all the stuff that they never told you
[07/13/2008 12:38:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[07/13/2008 12:38:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: not sure what you mean.. wanna call me?
[07/13/2008 12:38:19 PM] bjcullinan: [07/13/2008 12:28:59 PM] Ryan Woodall: that's what you think... she never wanted to get physical, it was to make you happy
[07/13/2008 12:38:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: ooooh
[07/13/2008 12:38:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh so thats where it's coming from
[07/13/2008 12:38:53 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2008 12:39:18 PM] bjcullinan: i guess there are always things you don't tell your partner just to keep them happy
[07/13/2008 12:39:27 PM] bjcullinan: but i am just saying it doesn't have to be that way
[07/13/2008 12:39:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah?
[07/13/2008 12:40:00 PM] bjcullinan: but i don't think that is entirely true, because we did a lot of stuff sexually, i think it just ended on a bad note so that is what she remembers
[07/13/2008 12:40:31 PM] bjcullinan: nvm
[07/13/2008 12:40:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: I believe I would tell you if something is chronically wrong
[07/13/2008 12:40:44 PM] bjcullinan: you would tell me if there was something right?
[07/13/2008 12:40:47 PM] bjcullinan: like the hair thing
[07/13/2008 12:40:51 PM] bjcullinan: that was a good start!
[07/13/2008 12:41:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: ya!
[07/13/2008 12:41:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i would tell you
[07/13/2008 12:41:19 PM] bjcullinan: it took a lot of prying
[07/13/2008 12:41:29 PM] bjcullinan: maybe you could make it a little easier for me?
[07/13/2008 12:41:36 PM] bjcullinan: to get it out of you
[07/13/2008 12:41:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: next time it will be easier
[07/13/2008 12:42:05 PM] bjcullinan: sounds good
[07/13/2008 12:42:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: it was like the more you pried the more i wanted to keep it in
[07/13/2008 12:42:12 PM] bjcullinan: wasn't there something else you had to tell me?
[07/13/2008 12:42:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz it wasnt even that big of a deal and it made me feel more foolish
[07/13/2008 12:42:30 PM] bjcullinan: why would you want to keep it in?
[07/13/2008 12:42:35 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[07/13/2008 12:42:38 PM] bjcullinan: i see
[07/13/2008 12:42:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[07/13/2008 12:42:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: Um something else... 
[07/13/2008 12:43:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think i know what you are talking about, but i dont know what it could be
[07/13/2008 12:43:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: like, i dont remember what the something else was
[07/13/2008 12:43:18 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2008 12:43:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i feel like i told you, whatever it was.
[07/13/2008 12:43:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[07/13/2008 12:43:38 PM] bjcullinan: well i am sure we will figure it out
[07/13/2008 12:43:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: um.. i did tell you two things, i remember now
[07/13/2008 12:43:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you saying there was a third thing
[07/13/2008 12:44:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: the first thing was that story i said about sean kissing gia and saying he can tell she shaved her upper lip...
[07/13/2008 12:44:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmmmmmmmmm
[07/13/2008 12:44:42 PM] bjcullinan: yeah maybe i am just thinking of another night
[07/13/2008 12:44:46 PM] bjcullinan: i am sure you told me
[07/13/2008 12:45:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant think of anything
[07/13/2008 12:45:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: but im only thinking along the lines of the hair thing
[07/13/2008 12:45:20 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2008 12:45:26 PM] bjcullinan: i think it was something after that
[07/13/2008 12:45:32 PM] bjcullinan: during the nights that we didn't talk
[07/13/2008 12:45:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: like just a couple nights ago?
[07/13/2008 12:47:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: well the point is.. i think our sex life is very well balanced, and there is nothing else that bothers me in the relationship
[07/13/2008 12:47:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are such a gentleman to me
[07/13/2008 12:47:31 PM] bjcullinan: i try
[07/13/2008 12:48:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know what its like to do things i dont want to do just to make a guy happy
[07/13/2008 12:48:07 PM] bjcullinan: you should ask for a job at ratheon
[07/13/2008 12:48:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats what i did in highschool
[07/13/2008 12:48:18 PM] bjcullinan: so that i can get an internship in the same department
[07/13/2008 12:48:25 PM] bjcullinan: and you can be above me in the work force
[07/13/2008 12:48:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[07/13/2008 12:48:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: the only summer you can get an intership is the summer you are going out of the country, which i almost forgot about
[07/13/2008 12:49:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: have you considered grad school
[07/13/2008 12:49:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: do CS kids do grad school often?
[07/13/2008 12:50:12 PM] bjcullinan: if i had an internship i would stay an extra semester and take fun stuff
[07/13/2008 12:50:24 PM] bjcullinan: so it would be fall 2010 instead of spring
[07/13/2008 12:51:05 PM] bjcullinan: then i could pay off loans and pay for tuition that year and still have money left over to get an apartment while i find a more permanent job
[07/13/2008 12:51:21 PM] bjcullinan: i want to get an MBA in business
[07/13/2008 12:51:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: sheesh
[07/13/2008 12:51:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: ooh an MBA sounds cool!
[07/13/2008 12:51:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: you have loans?
[07/13/2008 12:51:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought you didnt have loans
[07/13/2008 12:52:00 PM] bjcullinan: there is always the chance that i can make up the missed work
[07/13/2008 12:52:13 PM] bjcullinan: by working later in the summer
[07/13/2008 12:52:21 PM] bjcullinan: like until the end of august
[07/13/2008 12:52:28 PM] bjcullinan: and starting right after school gets out
[07/13/2008 12:52:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: I um
[07/13/2008 12:52:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont think so
[07/13/2008 12:52:42 PM] bjcullinan: then working really hard and taking 2 weeks off in the middle
[07/13/2008 12:53:06 PM] bjcullinan: you don't think they would like that idea?
[07/13/2008 12:53:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: I just dont know if they'd go for that, but it's worth a shot!
[07/13/2008 12:53:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: I've never done it and i havent heard of anyone else doing it
[07/13/2008 12:53:22 PM] bjcullinan: well you get pto all the time!
[07/13/2008 12:53:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i start as soon as i can and stop at the latest day i can
[07/13/2008 12:53:40 PM] bjcullinan: mine would just be consolidated
[07/13/2008 12:53:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: I get 10 hours of pto for every month i work in
[07/13/2008 12:54:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just dont get how you can work til the end of august if you have school
[07/13/2008 12:54:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i have 40 hours
[07/13/2008 12:54:35 PM] bjcullinan: yeah so can't i consolidate all my pto and use it at once?
[07/13/2008 12:54:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: but  new people get 8 hours per month
[07/13/2008 12:54:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes you can
[07/13/2008 12:54:53 PM] bjcullinan: but that doesn't cover 2 weeks
[07/13/2008 12:55:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i only get one week
[07/13/2008 12:55:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: so.. you have loans?
[07/13/2008 12:55:59 PM] bjcullinan: well i might be able to get an internship with Mike, Erika's dad, it would be paid and he might be a little more lenient on the hours so i could make up time
[07/13/2008 12:56:11 PM] bjcullinan: i do not have loans
[07/13/2008 12:56:27 PM] bjcullinan: so far i have zero loans
[07/13/2008 12:56:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh.. you confused me by saying pay off loans
[07/13/2008 12:56:50 PM] bjcullinan: and i am trying to keep it that way, i made it so far already! i would hate to have to start getting loans now
[07/13/2008 12:56:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: youneed a fucking credit card.
[07/13/2008 12:57:06 PM] bjcullinan: i means if i got a loan, i could pay it off with an internship job
[07/13/2008 12:57:11 PM] bjcullinan: neg
[07/13/2008 12:57:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: OMG
[07/13/2008 12:57:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: you not haveing loans AND having a credit card would make your credit so good!!!@$!#%!
[07/13/2008 12:57:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: you need to build that over time, do you not know anything about the importance of credit?????
[07/13/2008 12:58:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: theres a problem there brian, and i try to speak up about that
[07/13/2008 12:58:32 PM] bjcullinan: ok i will go to the bank and get one
[07/13/2008 12:58:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dont have to go to a bank
[07/13/2008 12:58:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont believe you.
[07/13/2008 12:59:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: just go to citicards.com
[07/13/2008 12:59:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought we could pick one together!
[07/13/2008 01:00:08 PM] bjcullinan: i want one from chase
[07/13/2008 01:00:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[07/13/2008 01:00:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: theres a chase right by my house.
[07/13/2008 01:00:58 PM] bjcullinan: what is apr?
[07/13/2008 01:01:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont knwo what is apr?
[07/13/2008 01:01:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: april? lol,
[07/13/2008 01:02:05 PM] bjcullinan: interest rate
[07/13/2008 01:02:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: annual percentage rate
[07/13/2008 01:02:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: not to be confused with annual percentage yield
[07/13/2008 01:04:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i still dont think you have to go into the bank, just do it online
[07/13/2008 01:04:38 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/13/2008 01:05:28 PM] bjcullinan: so is it better to have low APR or high APR?
[07/13/2008 01:05:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[07/13/2008 01:06:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: Brian.
[07/13/2008 01:06:08 PM] bjcullinan: because it says 0% APR first 12 billing cycles, and then it jumps to 19%
[07/13/2008 01:07:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: you want a low one, but for the first credit card, you really shouldn't care about the APR, because it's going to be high anyway cuz a first timeer has no credit, so its a risk for the bank. The thing to do is to pay off what you buy with the card before you get your bill
[07/13/2008 01:08:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: so then it doesnt matter what the APR is
[07/13/2008 01:08:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz you never are affected by it.
[07/13/2008 01:08:33 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[07/13/2008 01:10:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: but, you have to pay it off
[07/13/2008 01:11:07 PM] bjcullinan: what is so great about citi?
[07/13/2008 01:12:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: I have them, and so they are the first i think about
[07/13/2008 01:13:09 PM] bjcullinan: well i already have an account with chase
[07/13/2008 01:13:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: I once didnt pay my bill on time, and they didnt tell the credit bureaus which is fucking excellent, they just charged me money
[07/13/2008 01:13:18 PM] bjcullinan: and i might be getting another savings account with chase
[07/13/2008 01:13:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: then go far chase, just go for a company you like.
[07/13/2008 01:13:47 PM] bjcullinan: i should have invested in chase
[07/13/2008 01:13:55 PM] bjcullinan: when they bought bank one
[07/13/2008 01:14:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: that would have been a good idea,
[07/13/2008 01:15:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i should have invested in google
[07/13/2008 01:15:27 PM] bjcullinan: but my aunt works in the credit card department for BOA
[07/13/2008 01:16:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: ooh you should talk to her?
[07/13/2008 01:17:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: im watching Arrested Development and they are playing the song with "It's the final countdown"
[07/13/2008 01:17:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: totally reminds me of you
[07/13/2008 01:19:12 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[07/13/2008 01:19:15 PM] bjcullinan: i love that song
[07/13/2008 01:19:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i love it too
[07/13/2008 01:20:26 PM] bjcullinan: i love you@
[07/13/2008 01:20:28 PM] bjcullinan: !
[07/13/2008 01:20:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: I love you!
[07/13/2008 01:20:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont mean to hassle you about the credit card thing
[07/13/2008 01:20:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i think it's important
[07/13/2008 01:22:01 PM] bjcullinan: you are right
[07/13/2008 01:22:04 PM] bjcullinan: it is important
[07/13/2008 01:22:27 PM] bjcullinan: i will take care of it
[07/13/2008 01:22:36 PM] bjcullinan: it just hasn't been a priority
[07/13/2008 01:22:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, but it only takes a few minutes
[07/13/2008 01:23:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like (Link: http://www.bankrate.com/)http://www.bankrate.com/
[07/13/2008 01:26:46 PM] bjcullinan: my parents reactions are funny
[07/13/2008 01:27:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: what do you mean?
[07/13/2008 01:27:47 PM] bjcullinan: Brian: "Dad, I think i should get a credit card"
 Dad: "What's that going to do for you?"
 Brian: "Build credit"
 Dad: "Yawn"
[07/13/2008 01:28:17 PM] bjcullinan: i am going to be eating very tasty pizza in 10 minutes
[07/13/2008 01:29:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[07/13/2008 01:35:41 PM] bjcullinan: did you really want me to call or can i wait and call you after lunch?
[07/13/2008 01:36:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: you can wait or not call at all
[07/13/2008 01:36:25 PM] bjcullinan: well fine
[07/13/2008 01:36:30 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i just won't call at all
[07/13/2008 01:36:32 PM] bjcullinan: j/k
[07/13/2008 01:36:43 PM] bjcullinan: my dad and his girlfriend are like that
[07/13/2008 01:36:45 PM] bjcullinan: all the time
[07/13/2008 01:37:02 PM] bjcullinan: they fish for the right answer and when they don't get it they fight about it
[07/13/2008 01:37:06 PM] bjcullinan: it is real silly
[07/13/2008 01:37:37 PM] bjcullinan: like most recently she's all like "I am going out"
[07/13/2008 01:37:47 PM] bjcullinan: and she wanted my dad to say no stay and talk to me
[07/13/2008 01:37:59 PM] bjcullinan: but he was like "go for it"
[07/13/2008 01:38:05 PM] bjcullinan: and they "broke up"
[07/13/2008 01:38:10 PM] bjcullinan: it was silly
[07/13/2008 01:38:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha sounds like my mom
[07/13/2008 01:39:58 PM] bjcullinan: i think i acted like that when you got emotional when i suggested coming over last night
[07/13/2008 01:40:06 PM] bjcullinan: but i felt bad and was real sorry
[07/13/2008 01:40:27 PM] bjcullinan: i didn't even mean it to sound bad, but it did
[07/13/2008 01:41:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: ya that was.. kind of odd and not like you
[07/13/2008 01:45:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i was acting like that
[07/13/2008 01:45:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: so it's on me too
[07/13/2008 01:46:12 PM] bjcullinan: yeah

[07/14/2008 07:05:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: Sorry about last night
[07/14/2008 07:56:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: I have a meeting til 10.
[07/14/2008 09:10:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: Im out of the meeting
[07/14/2008 09:20:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont and didnt mean to be annoying, but "this text thing after talking is getting kind of old"? I know I'm not supposed to get disappointed so easily, but there must have been some better time before last night to tell me and some better way to tell me it.
[07/14/2008 09:20:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: I thought a text or two after talking was kinda nice and funny, but i guess not.
[07/14/2008 10:44:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm going in another meeting at 11, but please reply to me sometime after you get back from the dentist, or just wait til i get back to my desk
[07/14/2008 10:44:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: ew
[07/14/2008 10:51:39 AM] bjcullinan: hey
[07/14/2008 10:51:52 AM] bjcullinan: i realize i may have been a little cold with my response to your txts
[07/14/2008 10:52:07 AM] bjcullinan: i am sorry if i upset you i didn't mean it to come off as so harsh
[07/14/2008 10:52:27 AM] bjcullinan: i just think it is kind of silly to say goodnight and then keep talking
[07/14/2008 10:52:48 AM] bjcullinan: especially when i am going to bed
[07/14/2008 10:53:05 AM] bjcullinan: it means that i am actually getting ready for bed or already in bed ready to sleep
[07/14/2008 10:53:13 AM] bjcullinan: and not ready to keep txting
[07/14/2008 10:54:15 AM] bjcullinan: but i thought of a solution for us
[07/14/2008 10:54:31 AM] bjcullinan: if you still have stuff on your mind maybe just create the txt and then send it to me in the morning
[07/14/2008 10:54:48 AM] bjcullinan: or IM it to me if your computer is still on, then i will have something to wake up to
[07/14/2008 11:01:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: Confused because there are people in the room where i thought the meeting was, and i cant find AJ so maybe he is actually in there and the staffing meeting starts whenever the current one ends. I dont need to be there though
[07/14/2008 11:01:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: Thank you for telling that there was a problem
[07/14/2008 11:02:46 AM] bjcullinan: i didn't want it to become a problem
[07/14/2008 11:03:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: yes, good idea
[07/14/2008 11:04:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'm sorry!
[07/14/2008 11:05:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: i only got upset cuz i hate letting you down
[07/14/2008 11:05:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: doing something wrong
[07/14/2008 11:05:28 AM] bjcullinan: it's ok babe that's why we talk about these things
[07/14/2008 11:05:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: not being perfect
[07/14/2008 11:05:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: for you

[07/14/2008 11:06:22 AM] bjcullinan: you are still perfect
[07/14/2008 11:06:39 AM] bjcullinan: consider it the first thing that i don't like

[07/14/2008 11:10:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: like... thanksgiving, or next summer, or... sorta just imagining what it might be like if you i dont know.. proposed marriage
[07/14/2008 11:10:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: And even thursday i daydream about

[07/15/2008 10:43:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: She said she went to Nogales which she almost never does so i dont know who she is with
[07/15/2008 10:43:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'd like to call her friend who went to Phx with her to ask, because i feel like my mom would have told her

[07/15/2008 02:37:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: and just general feelings ive been feeling lately that are more in the back of my mind than everyday feelings, and greater than everyday feelings
[07/15/2008 02:38:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to talk about how the united states is doing.
[07/15/2008 02:39:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: my everyday feelings are like, wow im hungry, or, gee i'm tired, or, i wonder what brian is thinking right now
[07/15/2008 02:39:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: wow. i'm hungry

[07/15/2008 02:47:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: the weirdness is a reaction
[07/15/2008 02:47:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: now an overall feeling

[07/15/2008 02:48:11 PM] bjcullinan: so you dont want to talk about these feelings you've been having lately?
[07/15/2008 02:48:21 PM] bjcullinan: or do you want to wait until we see each other?
[07/15/2008 02:48:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: wait
[07/15/2008 02:49:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: guess i was just trying to explain why ive had nothing to say the past couple nights
[07/15/2008 02:50:56 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[07/15/2008 02:51:05 PM] bjcullinan: because you'd rather talk about it in person?
[07/15/2008 02:51:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: how do you feel right now?
[07/15/2008 02:51:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess so, love

[07/21/2008 08:34:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: I feel depressed today
[07/21/2008 08:34:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's depressing
[07/21/2008 08:44:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've been thinking for a while that maybe the pills I am taking currently arent doing as good a job as they could be. I mean I'm not going manic or full blown depressed, but i still feel sad more than i should be. It's hard to admit that the pills are right though, since fixing it can be tough and I dont have enough insurance to expirement. But on my drive this morning I realized maybe we could just up my dose. I wasn't planning on seeing my doc again since i have refills, but i think i am going to now.
[07/21/2008 08:44:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: It might also be that im just overly sad that I am without you again
[07/21/2008 08:46:24 AM] *** Disconnected from server.
[07/21/2008 08:51:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: just, IM me when you get the chance.
[07/21/2008 09:09:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: it is difficult for me to open up when I feel like it's not the right time to do it, or there are distractions, it's difficult when I think what I have to say might make me look stupid. It's hard when what i have to say is probably not what you want to hear. It's hard when the other person doesnt care.
[07/21/2008 09:12:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's easy when the other person DOES care, and is open in return. And i feel like we are in a safe environment or situation. And when I have an overall sense that the other person is easy to talk to. It's also easier the more i do it.
[07/21/2008 09:48:22 AM] bjcullinan: i always care to hear what you have to say. and i agree what you said about it being the right time.
[07/21/2008 09:51:59 AM] bjcullinan: i am sorry to hear you are having problems with your medication
[07/21/2008 09:52:51 AM] bjcullinan: i always thought that is was normal for people to feel a little down, do you think it could just be a down day? or has it been happening too frequently?
[07/21/2008 09:54:33 AM] bjcullinan: i don't think you are ever stupid, and sometimes i need to hear stuff, even though i don't want to
[07/21/2008 09:55:04 AM] bjcullinan: but sometimes it is best to wait to say things until we are alone and comfortable with each other
[07/21/2008 09:57:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: Hiiee!
[07/21/2008 10:03:40 AM] bjcullinan: you read what i wrote?
[07/21/2008 10:03:46 AM] bjcullinan: because i read what you wrote
[07/21/2008 10:03:48 AM] bjcullinan: and responded
[07/21/2008 10:04:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: I read what you wrote hun
[07/21/2008 10:04:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: Im not sure ill be able to see someone before i lose insurance for the medication thing, but i can handle it. it might just be the regular blues
[07/21/2008 10:05:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: and today makes sense, because you are gone and I am sad about that
[07/21/2008 10:06:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: and your response to my answer is nice
[07/21/2008 10:07:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: i cant remember the 2nd question but thats all rigth
[07/21/2008 10:09:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i do keep thinking about the circle K question
[07/21/2008 10:09:25 AM] bjcullinan: circle k question?
[07/21/2008 10:09:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: because I have an idea of what you
[07/21/2008 10:09:29 AM] bjcullinan: which one was that?
[07/21/2008 10:09:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think you asked it at or around circle k, what would i wanna do if i got knocked up
[07/21/2008 10:11:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: so i have an idea of what you'd want me to say, but i don't know if I can say that
[07/21/2008 10:16:11 AM] bjcullinan: have you still not started your period?
[07/21/2008 10:16:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: today would be a normal day to start, I went back this morning and looked at my last three start days
[07/21/2008 10:16:46 AM] bjcullinan: and mom says that if i have a credit card that i don't use it still shows other creditors that i have 1500 dollars of debt

[07/21/2008 11:10:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'll have to organize my email in folders before hand, which i can figure out how to do, but I'd like you to show me how to archive, because it hasnt seemed to work for me, and I dont even know if Im going the IMAP vs POP thing right.
[07/21/2008 11:10:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: but otherwise, we can talk about it later
[07/21/2008 11:10:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: omg my first payment is 11,970 due by august 8th!

[07/21/2008 12:02:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i mentioned staying at your place two extra days past Defcon to do computer stuff and make love. But i just thought of a way to be there FIVE extra days at the same cost to me (Work wise). So I know its a lot of me, but it would be Thursday night July 31st to Sunday late-afternoon August 10th, so when you get back you can tell me what you think

[07/21/2008 12:04:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: it also makes more work sense for both of us, taking a full week off rather than 3 days here and 2 days there. but this is only better if you wanted me to stay two days in the first place

[07/22/2008 05:55:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: even after closing out VLC
[07/22/2008 05:56:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: my sis is going to go watch hancock at 755 so i have to be at her place at like 720
[07/22/2008 05:56:14 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that is because it is playing on vlc

[07/22/2008 05:57:02 PM] bjcullinan: yeah

[07/22/2008 05:57:17 PM] bjcullinan: you can't pause
[07/22/2008 05:57:22 PM] bjcullinan: because it is playing on the server

[07/22/2008 05:57:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: then i closed out
[07/22/2008 05:57:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: then i opened and they were on a couch and one guy was cutting into a muffin

[07/22/2008 05:59:47 PM] bjcullinan: this is why i didn't want to do this
[07/22/2008 05:59:56 PM] bjcullinan: we should watch it together or not watch it at all
[07/22/2008 06:00:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: :'(
[07/22/2008 06:00:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can
[07/22/2008 06:00:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can go rent it.
[07/22/2008 06:00:46 PM] bjcullinan: no
[07/22/2008 06:00:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok.
[07/22/2008 06:01:00 PM] bjcullinan: you could try
[07/22/2008 06:01:07 PM] bjcullinan: but it is pretty unlikely that they will have it
[07/22/2008 06:01:26 PM] bjcullinan: or you could watch it with me
[07/22/2008 06:01:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm this is what i planned to do for two hours at my sisters.
[07/22/2008 06:02:06 PM] bjcullinan: then fuckin go to your sisters

[07/22/2008 06:03:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: mood swings
[07/22/2008 06:04:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was merely saying that i have to think of something else to do instead of watching the movie at my sisters.
[07/22/2008 06:04:54 PM] bjcullinan: you can watch it at your sisters
[07/22/2008 06:05:02 PM] bjcullinan: you are just making this overly complicated
[07/22/2008 06:05:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: no im not
[07/22/2008 06:05:22 PM] bjcullinan: and i don't want the movie to be spoiled for you because you keep trying to watch it without telling me what you are doing
[07/22/2008 06:05:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: you make me feel bad
[07/22/2008 06:06:39 PM] bjcullinan: don't feel bad

[07/23/2008 07:49:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm afraid I will be feeling crummy every day til i see you again
[07/23/2008 07:49:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: not good.
[07/23/2008 07:49:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: that's why i asked if I am everything you hoped for
[07/23/2008 07:50:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz it seemed like at the beginning you thought i was one of those people who strives to be better, and someone who works towards goals, and has motivation
[07/23/2008 07:50:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: someone who has it together
[07/23/2008 07:50:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: and i really havent shown you that in a long time
[07/23/2008 07:51:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: or i have and I just have too low of a self esteem to see it.
[07/23/2008 07:53:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: I think it'd feel better this summer if i came up with a good filing system, and threw a lot of stuff out that I have in boxes, and found my address list, and sent some thank yous, and organized my documents and email.
[07/23/2008 07:53:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: but for now i feel crummy and wasteful
[07/23/2008 08:00:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: you seemed to feel weird about talking about marriage, and i never knew that until recently. Like you wanted to go in the jewelery store and when I said I like to look at rings you practically ran away, and you were like oh no when i first pulled out that book, and then you dont want any questions with the word marriage or marry in it.
[07/23/2008 08:00:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: and its fine with me, i just didnt know.
[07/23/2008 08:01:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: thank god its wednesday and not tuesday
[07/23/2008 08:05:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: I hate to think my happiness depends upon being around you. Maybe im just stuck in a rut, and having boring work to do at work makes it harder, so that when i get home i dont do anything cuz im just sick of looking at a computer, and thinking of sorting out my life mess bothers me.

[07/23/2008 10:58:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: but you texted me 50  minutes ago, so I think I should give you more time. Then you can IM me when you get up and tell me what kept you up so late!

[07/23/2008 03:15:08 PM] bjcullinan: to be honest you were starting to smell
[07/23/2008 03:15:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: fuck brian
[07/23/2008 03:15:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: you could have said something
[07/23/2008 03:15:37 PM] bjcullinan: but i think it was just because of a long day, and not showering very well earlier
[07/23/2008 03:16:06 PM] bjcullinan: so maybe that is why i wasn't as enthusiastic as i normally am
[07/23/2008 03:16:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm suprised me not smelling very much lasted so long with you
[07/23/2008 03:16:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[07/23/2008 03:16:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[07/23/2008 03:16:23 PM] bjcullinan: but usually it doesn't smell at all
[07/23/2008 03:16:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill try and take care of it better next time
[07/23/2008 03:16:31 PM] bjcullinan: so don't be discouraged

[07/24/2008 12:18:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: ctrl+enter takes you out of editing mode and into just the box selected mode
[07/24/2008 12:18:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've tried so many things with alts and shifts and ctrls and tabs and enters

[07/24/2008 12:33:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought it would be seen as spam by the system
[07/24/2008 12:36:05 PM] bjcullinan: do you think people can only get so smart?
[07/24/2008 12:36:28 PM] bjcullinan: i mean what happens to all the stuff people already figured out, like past technologies?
[07/24/2008 12:37:17 PM] bjcullinan: i mean can we really move forward with technology without understanding how we got there?
[07/24/2008 12:37:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[07/24/2008 12:38:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: when you say people as a society, i think our smartness is almost limitless, for lack of a better word
[07/24/2008 12:39:15 PM] bjcullinan: what if they deny my because i don't have a secure job!?
[07/24/2008 12:39:37 PM] bjcullinan: i don't make enough money a year to pay off a credit card!
[07/24/2008 12:39:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think the more we move forward, the less we have to take time to understand the past stuff
[07/24/2008 12:40:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: they wont deny you
[07/24/2008 12:40:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: and all you have to give them on chases fill out thing is your annual income
[07/24/2008 12:40:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: which you could guess from last year or half of this year times two
[07/24/2008 12:40:42 PM] bjcullinan: and rent
[07/24/2008 12:40:59 PM] bjcullinan: so what ever i lie aboue my annual income it has to be more then rent
[07/24/2008 12:41:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: so your paying your dad rent?
[07/24/2008 12:41:07 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/24/2008 12:41:12 PM] bjcullinan: my parents
[07/24/2008 12:41:24 PM] bjcullinan: paying my mom rent
[07/24/2008 12:41:29 PM] bjcullinan: but my dad pays for it
[07/24/2008 12:41:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: well how would you pay rent if annual income is less?
[07/24/2008 12:41:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[07/24/2008 12:41:53 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i should just put 10,000
[07/24/2008 12:41:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: dad pays mom through you?
[07/24/2008 12:41:57 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[07/24/2008 12:42:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you mean, you could put in rent, but then add that amount to your annual income
[07/24/2008 12:42:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think thats a good ide
[07/24/2008 12:42:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: a
[07/24/2008 12:43:17 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha Student: Medical/Law or Student: Other
[07/24/2008 12:43:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: its like your job money plus income from your dad that you immediately pay rent with
[07/24/2008 12:43:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[07/24/2008 12:43:25 PM] bjcullinan: they are majorist
[07/24/2008 12:43:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: arent we all
[07/24/2008 12:43:54 PM] bjcullinan: what if i get fired
[07/24/2008 12:44:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dont have to tell them
[07/24/2008 12:44:26 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i should put self employed
[07/24/2008 12:44:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: you never really tell them anything besides this time so they can decide how much credit to give you and apr and stuff
[07/24/2008 12:44:55 PM] bjcullinan: do i have to be honest about being a student?
[07/24/2008 12:45:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not sure how far you can stretch the truth
[07/24/2008 12:45:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: if i were asked my occupation and the list says student blah blah engineering, i would pick engineering
[07/24/2008 12:46:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: but if occupation is separate from "are you a student" then i would put both student and engineering
[07/24/2008 12:49:00 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i should put own
[07/24/2008 12:49:03 PM] bjcullinan: instead of rent
[07/24/2008 12:49:19 PM] bjcullinan: and i only pay 650 dollars worth of the mortgage each month
[07/24/2008 12:49:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was wondering what you were going to put there
[07/24/2008 12:49:25 PM] bjcullinan: what do you think?
[07/24/2008 12:49:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm do it!
[07/24/2008 12:49:49 PM] bjcullinan: because it isn't really a formal rent situation
[07/24/2008 12:50:08 PM] bjcullinan: nah i'll put rent
[07/24/2008 12:50:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just think any amount you have to pay in rent or mortgage or whatever should be added to both rent amount and income amount
[07/24/2008 12:52:24 PM] bjcullinan: i finished applying
[07/24/2008 12:52:40 PM] bjcullinan: this is all your fault
[07/24/2008 12:52:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats great!
[07/24/2008 12:52:50 PM] bjcullinan: if i get bad credit i am blaming you
[07/24/2008 12:53:01 PM] bjcullinan: or if i go into debt
[07/24/2008 12:53:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: you wont get bad credit! you have no debt
[07/24/2008 12:53:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: you'll have debt when you use the card, but you will pay that off
[07/24/2008 12:53:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: right?!
[07/24/2008 12:54:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: what you do with the credit card aint my fault huneh
[07/24/2008 12:54:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe.. you should forget you have it if it's gonna be a problem
[07/24/2008 12:54:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think its funny that i have 12 dollars in S&P
[07/24/2008 12:58:43 PM] bjcullinan: S&P?
[07/24/2008 12:58:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh S&P 500
[07/24/2008 12:59:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: one of those big funds
[07/24/2008 12:59:20 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[07/24/2008 12:59:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: index fund i think is what its called
[07/24/2008 12:59:29 PM] bjcullinan: only 12 dollars?
[07/24/2008 12:59:33 PM] bjcullinan: bfd
[07/24/2008 12:59:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know, thats why i think it's silly
[07/24/2008 01:00:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: well, i have it put some percentage of my paycheck into different investments, and i put a little percent in S&P, and I dont get paid much, so so far its 12 bucks
[07/24/2008 01:00:41 PM] bjcullinan: lame
[07/24/2008 01:01:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: but the reason it came up is because i changed all my deductions to 0% so i can have as much money as i can for school
[07/24/2008 01:01:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think its lame
[07/24/2008 01:08:51 PM] bjcullinan: i gots a new icon on the desktop for my portal window

[07/24/2008 03:05:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe im just thinking of your mass tag editing for songs, which i think also renames the file.

[07/25/2008 08:15:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: hi kiddo, did you go back to bed?
[07/25/2008 08:16:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'll assume yes
[07/25/2008 08:21:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: Thank you for your help this morning
[07/25/2008 08:24:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: I could figure these things out by myself, but

[07/25/2008 09:02:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: my mom's missing again
[07/25/2008 09:03:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: she went to a kids party yesterday and she asked if I would baby sit from 10pm to 6:30 am, and i said okay, but she never came home. It would make sense if her boyfriend(?) lived in town, but he doesnt. Now she's not answering the phone, but i'll just wait for her call.
[07/25/2008 09:45:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: things are looking iffy with the Monday Tuesday thing
[07/25/2008 09:46:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: I've been checking everyday on Newzbin to see if they have BSG season 2 OST, but it hasnt come up yet. Do you mind getting it as a torrent?
[07/25/2008 10:14:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: I figured it out!!
[07/25/2008 10:54:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: it must be this ripe banana in my favorite ear
[07/25/2008 10:54:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: which is the left ear by the way
[07/25/2008 10:55:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: after many minutes of figuring out how to take two extra days off, i figured it out and felt dumb for not thinking of it in the first place!
[07/25/2008 10:55:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: so I will be coming thursday night and taking all of the next week off

[07/25/2008 11:56:31 AM] bjcullinan: you mean a lot to be babe, i just am not good at dealing with drama
[07/25/2008 11:57:00 AM] bjcullinan: i did want to help but i don't know what to do, it is hard for me to make conversation in that type of situation
[07/25/2008 11:57:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: i just dont see how its hard to have a normal conversation without the drama
[07/25/2008 11:57:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay

[07/25/2008 11:59:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: yesterday i was talking to someone and i had a tampon in my jacket pocket
[07/25/2008 11:59:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: and it fell out when i was playing with my pockets
[07/25/2008 11:59:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: luckily it was a lady i was talking to
[07/25/2008 11:59:37 AM] bjcullinan: that's embarrassing
[07/25/2008 11:59:53 AM] bjcullinan: but it happens
[07/25/2008 12:00:06 PM] bjcullinan: like that time the condom fell out when i was getting cash
[07/25/2008 12:00:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i had the tampon because i took it out of the dispenser, but then realized once in the stall that i didnt need it, but i felt weird about putting it back
[07/25/2008 12:00:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol yeah
[07/25/2008 12:00:17 PM] bjcullinan: i have since put it in a different place in my wallet

[07/25/2008 12:00:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant remember, were you just with me?
[07/25/2008 12:00:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats smart of you to move it
[07/25/2008 12:00:44 PM] bjcullinan: yeah it was with you
[07/25/2008 12:00:50 PM] bjcullinan: maybe in ohio?

[07/25/2008 12:02:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought of charlie the unicorn 2 and how my sister dances to the song
[07/25/2008 12:03:48 PM] bjcullinan: haha, see you didn't even need my help

[07/25/2008 12:06:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: well

[07/25/2008 12:09:51 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[07/25/2008 12:09:57 PM] bjcullinan: because of the lack of space?
[07/25/2008 12:10:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: no because my dad;s thinking his schedule wont allow for him to come with
[07/25/2008 12:10:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: but he said he would give me $300 to help with expense

[07/26/2008 02:36:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i need your help, have girl dilemma
[07/26/2008 02:41:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel terrible that i am putting that pressure on you
[07/26/2008 02:42:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i shouldnt be calling him when i feel let down by you
[07/26/2008 02:43:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i shouldnt react in such a way that i feel that you are letting me down, cuz when i look back i just was being a fool, and you were doing your best
[07/26/2008 02:43:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant expect you to be around for every little thing i want
[07/26/2008 02:44:20 PM] bjcullinan: i want to be there for you when you are having trouble
[07/26/2008 02:44:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i certainly shouldnt look to steve out of spite when im just so wrapped up in the moment and not thinking clearly
[07/26/2008 02:45:06 PM] bjcullinan: i think there is a bigger problem here
[07/26/2008 02:45:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry, and I will try to control my feelings, you are amazing to me, and i just need to remember that even when i cant have what i want
[07/26/2008 02:45:24 PM] bjcullinan: you seem to turn away from me instead of wanting to work things out
[07/26/2008 02:45:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do?
[07/26/2008 02:45:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: seem
[07/26/2008 02:46:01 PM] bjcullinan: like that night i smoked
[07/26/2008 02:46:03 PM] bjcullinan: you ran away
[07/26/2008 02:46:12 PM] bjcullinan: and when you get upset you talk to steve
[07/26/2008 02:46:57 PM] bjcullinan: i hope with time those tendencies will change, and you will want to talk to me, even when you are upset with me or just upset in general
[07/26/2008 02:46:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: im  not good enough
[07/26/2008 02:47:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant show that im upset tho
[07/26/2008 02:47:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i have to run away, what else can i do?
[07/26/2008 02:47:54 PM] bjcullinan: you don't have to be afraid of showing that your upset, not to me
[07/26/2008 02:47:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: a bigger problem.
[07/26/2008 02:48:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess im so afraid of making you think bad of me and putting me a step closer to losing you
[07/26/2008 02:48:56 PM] bjcullinan: that won't happen
[07/26/2008 02:49:04 PM] bjcullinan: i want to be there for you when you are upset
[07/26/2008 02:49:11 PM] bjcullinan: but you have to let me in
[07/26/2008 02:49:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to let you be there
[07/26/2008 02:49:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: bur it's hard for me to let you in, i know i need to fix it
[07/26/2008 02:50:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not dressed
[07/26/2008 02:51:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not gonna talk to steve like that anymore.
[07/26/2008 02:51:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: ever since you said i should get so disappointed so easily, i kind of feel worse when i mess up
[07/26/2008 02:52:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i was disappointed that you couldnt talk to me on the phone when i needed you there while i was at work
[07/26/2008 02:53:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: um.. so....... i guess i should get dressed then cuz you arent talking
[07/26/2008 02:58:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i dont like when we are talking online and then you stop talking and dont tell me why
[07/26/2008 03:00:05 PM] bjcullinan: sorry
[07/26/2008 03:00:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: I can't do everything myself, i mean i shouldnt be the one to change everything. that was the trouble in my last relationship, everything that was bad was always my fault and he never changed the behavior that made me upset. sure everyone knows i shouldnt get so upset but cut me some slack here and there and help me out!
[07/26/2008 03:00:07 PM] bjcullinan: i was here
[07/26/2008 03:00:17 PM] bjcullinan: i was just marking some spots on the wall
[07/26/2008 03:00:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh lol
[07/26/2008 03:00:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just think simple things can make  a big difference
[07/26/2008 03:00:48 PM] bjcullinan: you shouldn't have to change everything
[07/26/2008 03:00:59 PM] bjcullinan: i will try to be there for you more when you are upset
[07/26/2008 03:01:17 PM] bjcullinan: but you can't go running off every time it happens
[07/26/2008 03:01:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i mean there are things you can do
[07/26/2008 03:02:17 PM] bjcullinan: i just told you i'd try to be there for you more
[07/26/2008 03:02:18 PM] bjcullinan: or better
[07/26/2008 03:02:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: preventative things. 
[07/26/2008 03:02:27 PM] bjcullinan: like when you called me at work
[07/26/2008 03:02:38 PM] bjcullinan: like what?
[07/26/2008 03:02:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay i believe you
[07/26/2008 03:03:03 PM] bjcullinan: i don't think it can be prevented, we will sometimes be upset, it is completely natural
[07/26/2008 03:03:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm think more about how what you say will make me feel?
[07/26/2008 03:03:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: it can be sometimes prevented, but of course not all of it
[07/26/2008 03:03:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: there will be upsetting times
[07/26/2008 03:04:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like it when you type or text "oh" cuz then i cant read you
[07/26/2008 03:04:16 PM] bjcullinan: but they aren't my fault
[07/26/2008 03:04:29 PM] bjcullinan: what was i supposed to do when you were at work
[07/26/2008 03:04:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: some are a little your fault
[07/26/2008 03:04:50 PM] bjcullinan: example?
[07/26/2008 03:04:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: a lot of it is my fault for being so easily upset
[07/26/2008 03:05:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: shit example. um 
[07/26/2008 03:05:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm terrible at examples.. i......
[07/26/2008 03:06:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you tell me that you are marking holes then i wont be upset that you arent talking to me
[07/26/2008 03:06:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: theres an example
[07/26/2008 03:07:05 PM] bjcullinan: i don't like that
[07/26/2008 03:07:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like that you dont like that
[07/26/2008 03:07:48 PM] bjcullinan: i used to have to tell the people that i worked with every time i stepped away from the computer, even if we weren't talking
[07/26/2008 03:07:55 PM] bjcullinan: i couldn't stand it
[07/26/2008 03:08:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dont have to do it everytime, it would just help if you did it sometimes
[07/26/2008 03:08:32 PM] bjcullinan: you said "i'm not dressed" so i assumed your were going to take care of that
[07/26/2008 03:08:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont make me feel bad
[07/26/2008 03:09:11 PM] bjcullinan: this conversation is starting to bother me
[07/26/2008 03:09:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: when you know you could do something about it
[07/26/2008 03:09:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: im trying to make our relationship better and you seem to be saying you arent willing to change 
[07/26/2008 03:10:13 PM] bjcullinan: i didn't tell you that i was stepping away from the computer because i didn't even think about it, it wasn't that big of deal, i check back at my IMs every couple of minutes and i would have responded, but you were bothered by that
[07/26/2008 03:10:47 PM] bjcullinan: i am not saying that i am not willing to change, i am saying i will work on it, but the things we are talking about changing aren't the real problem
[07/26/2008 03:10:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel lonely!
[07/26/2008 03:11:16 PM] bjcullinan: i am sorry
[07/26/2008 03:11:22 PM] bjcullinan: you know i wish i could be there for you
[07/26/2008 03:11:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just want to feel like i'm with you more
[07/26/2008 03:11:55 PM] bjcullinan: i understand
[07/26/2008 03:12:55 PM] bjcullinan: it is going to be hard being apart
[07/26/2008 03:13:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want to be one of those girlfriends that wants to know exactly what my bf is doing all the time, but i dont like to not know. i dont want to have to ask
[07/26/2008 03:13:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[07/26/2008 03:13:37 PM] bjcullinan: you don't want to have to ask, but i don't always want to have to tell
[07/26/2008 03:14:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i think it will help me learn to get better about how i react when i feel im not sure what you are doing
[07/26/2008 03:14:22 PM] bjcullinan: when you said "and i dont like when we are talking online and then you stop talking and dont tell me why"
[07/26/2008 03:14:49 PM] bjcullinan: i think that was not something that should bother you
[07/26/2008 03:15:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: can you tell me what you are going when you want to tell me
[07/26/2008 03:15:26 PM] bjcullinan: because when i returned to my computer after being away for only a few minutes, we had to talk about that, instead i could have just told you that i was marking holes to drill
[07/26/2008 03:15:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: i agree and i think that there are a lot of things that shouldnt bother me, but i thinkj you could help out with that
[07/26/2008 03:16:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont get what you are syaingm?
[07/26/2008 03:16:37 PM] bjcullinan: now i feel shut off, and don't want to talk because i feel restricted
[07/26/2008 03:17:18 PM] bjcullinan: is it really that different if i tell you what i was just doing afterward? it doesn't have to be before i go an do it
[07/26/2008 03:17:37 PM] bjcullinan: i can understand you wanting a warning, but i was really only going to be away from my computer for a minute
[07/26/2008 03:17:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: no thats fine too babe!
[07/26/2008 03:17:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: tell me what you are doing afterword is good too
[07/26/2008 03:17:51 PM] bjcullinan: i feel like we are not making any progress
[07/26/2008 03:18:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to make progress, but i never really learned how to do that
[07/26/2008 03:18:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: "brb?"
[07/26/2008 03:18:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: "brb"?
[07/26/2008 03:19:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do that for you because i try to do things to you that i want back from you
[07/26/2008 03:19:39 PM] bjcullinan: i just feel like now it is an obligation, and our conversation can just come naturally anymore
[07/26/2008 03:19:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: and there's something else
[07/26/2008 03:20:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont think of it as an obligation
[07/26/2008 03:20:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want it to be natural too
[07/26/2008 03:20:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: make it natural.. i dont knwo
[07/26/2008 03:20:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think this is working
[07/26/2008 03:20:44 PM] bjcullinan: yes, this is getting kind of ridiculous
[07/26/2008 03:20:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol ahh im frustrated
[07/26/2008 03:21:00 PM] bjcullinan: i am going to go drill stuff now
[07/26/2008 03:21:04 PM] bjcullinan: i'll talk to you later

[07/26/2008 03:21:26 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to be like that couple that argues about stupid stuff
[07/26/2008 03:21:33 PM] bjcullinan: and that is what this is quickly turning into
[07/26/2008 03:21:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[07/26/2008 03:22:03 PM] bjcullinan: i think instead of consiously talking about all the changes that we "have to make for each other" in order to get along is silly
[07/26/2008 03:22:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i see, okay ttyle
[07/26/2008 03:22:12 PM] bjcullinan: *consciously 
[07/26/2008 03:22:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: instead/
[07/26/2008 03:22:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[07/26/2008 03:22:29 PM] bjcullinan: we need to learn to grow together
[07/26/2008 03:22:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes, we do
[07/26/2008 03:23:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i miss you
[07/26/2008 03:23:16 PM] bjcullinan: and that includes dealing with some of the things that go wrong and not letting it bother us
[07/26/2008 03:23:23 PM] bjcullinan: like the not saying brb
[07/26/2008 03:23:52 PM] bjcullinan: there are things that you do that i could complain about but i don't because i don't let it bother me
[07/26/2008 03:24:13 PM] bjcullinan: so i hope you can do the same for me
[07/26/2008 03:24:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: and should include understanding how to ugh i dont knwo
[07/26/2008 03:24:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: iiiii hooopeiouwe so too
[07/26/2008 03:25:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: go drill
[07/26/2008 03:37:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: you make it seem so simple... there are things i do that you could complain about but you dont because you don't let it bother you. So it's so easy for you to tell me we need to grow together, it's so easy for you to say that i shouldnt be bothered. and it's easy for you to think i can just not let it bother me. 
[07/26/2008 03:37:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: sure i dont want to be a couple that argues over stupid stuff either, but this isn't over.
[07/26/2008 03:39:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: you do a good job informing me.
[07/26/2008 03:39:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: bye
[07/26/2008 03:39:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh my cousin is going to be here for a bit

Session Start (bjcullinan@gmail.com:Crystal Diaz): Sat Jul 26 16:28:25 2008
[07/26/2008 04:28:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: There are times that I forget to think about how much you love me, and I get a little caught up in thinking of only myself and my feelings for you, which leads me to feel like i'm chasing you and things are one sided when they really really arent. I know you are crazy in love with me, but i think if you remind me just one more time every other day, than I will learn to remember that. Your simple sweet sayings really did it for me as I was falling for you at the beginning. You are always so sincere with everything you say and I love you for it.

I feel that my insecurity of thinking that i need more updating or whatever to feel like you like and care about me is bad/inconsiderate/selfish and stems from me forgetting how you feel about me. But i truely believe that every week that passes by, I grow more and more confident in our relationship. I've never had more solid of a connection with someone and I wish to always be grateful for what we have. I'm doing better at reminding myself, because ultimately i shouldnt have to have you remind me. But, you know, every girl loves a little sweet talk no matter how far along the relationship is. 

You should know that as easily as i let things bother me, I get over them really quickly. After thinking about what you said a little more (the " there are things you do that i could complain about...", which, not to mention, really has me curious yes unsure if i should ask you to extrapolate), i really do feel that your love for me is driving me to not only WANT to be a good girlfriend, but actually is driving me to BE a good girlfriend. And by good girlfriend i dont simply mean making you a sandwhich whenever you want, that's so easy (and I enjoy doing those things for you, whether or not you ask, btw), i mean, being good at being in a relationship, a good relationshiper, if you will. But overall it's gonna take time. Thanks for reading my novel i just wrote to you. Please support me and bear with me. I adore you and you can take that to the bank!
[07/26/2008 04:30:35 PM] bjcullinan: i love you
[07/26/2008 04:30:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: this is the "there's something else" i IMed earlier, as well as the "state of the relationship" thing I wanted to talk to you about when we were in the hotel but never got around to.
[07/26/2008 04:30:51 PM] bjcullinan: i just think we were making it worse by putting to much thought into it
[07/26/2008 04:30:58 PM] bjcullinan: let's keep things simple
[07/26/2008 04:31:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah i suppose
[07/26/2008 04:31:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: keep it simple stupid?
[07/26/2008 04:31:49 PM] bjcullinan: if something truly bothers you then we can work on it, but lets not try to plan ahead or assume that something is going to bother you and try to prevent it, because then it will just feel like a big weight over us
[07/26/2008 04:32:07 PM] bjcullinan: what is the something else?
[07/26/2008 04:32:12 PM] bjcullinan: and state of the relationship?
[07/26/2008 04:32:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: the thre paragraphs i sent
[07/26/2008 04:33:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like i might need more explanation about the big weight and stuff, but may i shouldnt put to much thought into it.
[07/26/2008 04:33:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i feel better now.
[07/26/2008 04:35:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: looking back, i like the amount you currently tell me about what you are doing, you tell me when you are going to see a movie, you tell me who you are going to dinner with, thank you!
[07/26/2008 04:36:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: man, being my boyfriend must be hard.
[07/26/2008 04:36:29 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[07/26/2008 04:36:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: Well i am going to get back to downloading shit for my cousin while she's at the movies, and should think about food
[07/26/2008 04:36:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i
[07/26/2008 04:36:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: will still be here
[07/26/2008 04:39:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: me asking you to say sweet things reminds me of the time we said sweet things at 10:24 pm. hah, we're cute. I like that, and that is what im talking about.
[07/26/2008 04:41:54 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[07/26/2008 05:04:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: there is talk of either me going out to dinner with sean or watching the fight with my sister at her house
[07/26/2008 05:54:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: this new sports bar just opened at the foothills mall, i'm going to go meet sean and his parents there. I'll talk to you later and i love you

[07/27/2008 03:20:11 AM] Crystal Diaz:  Dinner and a Movie

This one explores the psychology of power exchange. One of you agrees to be the submissive for the evening; the other is the dominant, the maestro, the one whose word is law. You go out for an evening on the town--a formal dinner, perhaps, and maybe a movie afterward. The dominant should establish a few rules beforehand; for example, the submissive is not allowed to speak to or have any contact with anyone except the dominant. So, for example, when you're ordering your meals in the restaurant, the submissive cannot tell the waiter what to bring; he or she must tell the dominant, who will then tell the waiter. (Or, you can turn this around; the dominant speaks to nobody except through the submissive.) Rules like this are fun to play with, because while the people around you may notice something is going on, the won't know exactly what. As the evening progresses, the dominant can find all kinds of delightfully subtle ways to tease the submissive.

Perhaps the dominant will tell the submissive to go to the restroom and remove his or her her underwear, the better to tease him or her in a darkened theater. The dominant can order the submissive not to come back out of the restroom until he or she has masturbated to high arousal.

Or perhaps the submissive will have to wear a sex toy or anal plug of some sort under his or her clothes. Maybe during dinner the dominant can whisper to the submissive what will happen when they get back home.

The key to enjoying this kind of scenario is to keep it quiet; it's great fun if nobody else has the slightest idea what's going on. (To an aroused submissive, it will seem like it's obvious and that everybody knows what's happening--and that's part of the fun!)
[07/27/2008 03:20:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: MINE!
[07/27/2008 03:20:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont expect you to read all that

[07/27/2008 04:22:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[07/27/2008 09:51:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: hey lover
[07/27/2008 09:51:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: I feel like it's going to be quite a while til you are awake as well
[07/27/2008 09:51:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: and to that, I say damn
[07/27/2008 09:52:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz you're the most beautiful thing on the planet
[07/27/2008 09:57:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: I wouldn't dare wake up my sleeping price after only 5 hours since we last spoke
[07/27/2008 10:06:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: I like milk with my waffles, but for some reason I always forget to drink most of it until there are only a few bites left
[07/27/2008 10:20:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's Number 3 on  Veronica Mars!
[07/27/2008 11:06:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: Brian, during our very first conversation (mmm good times) online, you asked if I had seen Gattaca, and I said something along the lines of no. In fact, I have seen Gattaca, probably freshman year, so that may be taken off the list.
[07/27/2008 11:09:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: I don't read our message history often, but I like that it keeps me in touch with the feelings I had for you from the night I met you. It wasnt a sudden "oh my gosh i like him!", but a gradual and wonderful attraction. April 18th will always be in my head as the day we really met
[07/27/2008 12:19:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: and by "price" i mean "prince"
[07/27/2008 12:49:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: It's almost time to call my baby!!

[07/27/2008 12:56:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: what, do you find waking up to 12 messages from me today unusual?
[07/27/2008 12:56:14 PM] bjcullinan: no
[07/27/2008 12:56:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: hah okay

[07/27/2008 01:33:00 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[07/27/2008 01:33:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: you sound pretty busy
[07/27/2008 01:33:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want it all in folders and if i want notes, i dont want to put in the whole notebook when the class only takes up a third of the notebook, i'm trying to conserve, i think eventually i will just toss all the notes out
[07/27/2008 01:52:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: shit man
[07/27/2008 01:53:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don;t know where my wriststrong is

[07/27/2008 02:20:36 PM] bjcullinan: done
[07/27/2008 02:40:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i was just curious about the things i do that you *could* complain about but dont, I mean if it's stuff that i cant change like the way my teeth are, or how i sometimes reask a question or say a comment more than once, but otherwise, I might care
[07/27/2008 02:42:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: hoiwever, i could also just forget abou
[07/27/2008 02:44:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: about it
[07/27/2008 02:44:32 PM] bjcullinan: well the reasking things
[07/27/2008 02:44:37 PM] bjcullinan: but i would never complain about it
[07/27/2008 02:44:42 PM] bjcullinan: because i just let it go
[07/27/2008 02:45:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: shit i knew it
[07/27/2008 02:45:11 PM] bjcullinan: but you say that is something you can't change
[07/27/2008 02:45:18 PM] bjcullinan: because "it's just the way you are"
[07/27/2008 02:45:33 PM] bjcullinan: maybe just the way i am is to walk away from the computer for a minute without letting anyone know
[07/27/2008 02:45:42 PM] bjcullinan: you just have to let that kind of stuff go
[07/27/2008 02:46:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay honey
[07/27/2008 02:46:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: shucks
[07/27/2008 02:47:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe, i should ask questions anymore?
[07/27/2008 02:47:34 PM] bjcullinan: maybe you should?
[07/27/2008 02:47:38 PM] bjcullinan: it's not a bad thing
[07/27/2008 02:47:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: shouldnt

[07/27/2008 02:47:57 PM] bjcullinan: i am not criticizing you for being the way you are
[07/27/2008 02:48:03 PM] bjcullinan: i really don't mind it
[07/27/2008 02:49:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i certainly never liked it about myself, i thought i asked you to tell me when i did it
[07/27/2008 02:49:37 PM] bjcullinan: well i barely notice so it doesn't bother me
[07/27/2008 02:49:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: you just dont want to tell me the other stuff huh
[07/27/2008 02:50:30 PM] bjcullinan: i might think of something else
[07/27/2008 02:50:34 PM] bjcullinan: when it comes up
[07/27/2008 02:50:40 PM] bjcullinan: g2g watch beastmaster
[07/27/2008 02:50:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry
[07/27/2008 02:50:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[07/27/2008 02:51:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i really should have seaid that about you walking away from the computer and not saying anything. you dont do it much and i really shouldnt mind it

[07/27/2008 07:37:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: nothing is classified of course, but there might be some raytheon proprietary stuff on there
[07/27/2008 07:39:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: im trying to think
[07/27/2008 07:41:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i could take stuff off but better safe than sorry? i dont know. if i asked anyone i think they'd say no, but for other reasons like they look down upon using a work computer like a personal computer. I just dont want to feel left out, so.,... no one has to know ?
[07/27/2008 07:42:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i left the baby bottles/nipples to soak, so i gotta go finish that poopiness
[07/27/2008 07:43:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: bugs suck.

[07/28/2008 07:37:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: I kept thinking of things that made me teary eyed, and I missed my exit, but that's ok
[07/28/2008 07:39:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: and I found out that I didnt need my glasses warranty papers, i could just call the place i got them at, but the warranty only lasts a year and it's been just over a year. If only i had called them when i thought to call them. well that;s my fucking life.
[07/28/2008 08:51:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: With a clear head, I was able to come up with a compromise with Roy

[07/28/2008 02:08:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, not sure what he's talking about

[07/28/2008 02:16:32 PM] bjcullinan: oh hai!
[07/28/2008 02:17:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's all.
[07/28/2008 02:52:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: I know you are away, but I've been bothered by wondering if you feel differently or restricted because of what i talked about when you were drilling holes. Don't listen to what i said, be the way you have been. I'm repeating this, becase I dont think I got a response.you dont have to change anything or feel like you have to do something. it's probably just me now recognizing when you do it that makes me think you are doing it only cuz i told you to. geeze im complicated.
[07/28/2008 02:57:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think seeing you will cure this emotional distance i currently feel from you. like it's all in my head, or you've just been more busy with your server than i'm used to, making you harder to feel close to, harder to read, harder  to feel in sync with like it used to be.
[07/28/2008 02:57:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: you're a good person
[07/28/2008 03:47:10 PM] bjcullinan: i think we are ok
[07/28/2008 03:47:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm so glad to hear you say that
[07/28/2008 03:47:37 PM] bjcullinan: ou don't have to worry about me telling you when i am gone because you told me to, i haven't really thought about it
[07/28/2008 03:47:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's good
[07/28/2008 03:48:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dunno what i was thinking when i said that
[07/28/2008 03:48:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel so much better now that you said you think we are okay, i guess that's just what i needed to hear from you

[07/30/2008 02:22:36 PM] bjcullinan: nuts go in cookies too
[07/30/2008 02:22:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol, nuts are good, but they get confusing in a brownie!

[07/31/2008 01:17:46 PM] bjcullinan: how was your doctors appointment
[07/31/2008 01:18:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do want to spend time packing, i just have all this work to do and things to do and only like one weeked to do it
[07/31/2008 01:20:01 PM] bjcullinan: you don't work at home?
[07/31/2008 01:20:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: the appointment i think turned out well, i started crying because of all these worries, but I got a higher dosage and I sent out for my pills this morning
[07/31/2008 01:20:36 PM] bjcullinan: i am sorry i was to tired to talk
[07/31/2008 01:20:54 PM] bjcullinan: i really intended on being all rested and getting up whenever you called
[07/31/2008 01:20:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: ive been planning on doing work at home tomorrow or sometime this weekend to make up for my planned day of not working tuesday
[07/31/2008 01:21:06 PM] bjcullinan: i went to bed at like 1, and couldn't fall asleep
[07/31/2008 01:21:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: no babe i totally understant
[07/31/2008 01:21:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw, well
[07/31/2008 01:21:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, you're okay now!
[07/31/2008 01:22:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel insensitive in a "why would you even consider that" sort of way regarding my txt
[07/31/2008 01:23:27 PM] bjcullinan: since all your clothes are already on hangers, do you ever just take them and put them in your car? i mean they don't really have to all be put in little drawers and then carried in a big dresser thing
[07/31/2008 01:23:46 PM] bjcullinan: regarding your txt?
[07/31/2008 01:23:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean if its not gonna be you, it's gonna be my dad, and my dad tried to talk me out of going alone this morning, and now im worried about the unpacking my car part, but it helps to think that a lot of other new students will be in the same boat as me
[07/31/2008 01:24:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha, we did that with my shisrts, but all my Pjs and undies and bras and pants went inthe drawers but im thinking of leaving a lot of that stuff anyways
[07/31/2008 01:24:50 PM] bjcullinan: hmm
[07/31/2008 01:25:02 PM] bjcullinan: i think it probably would damage our relationship
[07/31/2008 01:25:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just need to do everything fast
[07/31/2008 01:25:15 PM] bjcullinan: a lot
[07/31/2008 01:25:21 PM] bjcullinan: because i don't trust him
[07/31/2008 01:29:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, i think it's probably wrong for multiple reasons
[07/31/2008 01:30:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt want to say this cuz of the guilt trip factor, but fuck it, my psychiatrist said that he thinks if my boyfriend isnt willing to go with me then he doesnt think the relationship could last long distance, i dont believe that at all, i dont see the connection, and my dad keeps saying things. fuck this is ridiculous.
[07/31/2008 01:33:38 PM] bjcullinan: obviously this is something that means a lot to you, but i'd rather not get into it until we can talk about it in person
[07/31/2008 01:33:47 PM] bjcullinan: there is still time crystal, it will be ok
[07/31/2008 01:34:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like with anything related to grad school, i've never been more indecisive in my life.
[07/31/2008 01:35:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: those things are nice to hear, i'm glad you still care when im such a broken record or however the saying goes
[07/31/2008 01:38:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: Well i should go to a different room and do some hardcore work i've been putting off before i collapse with guilt
[07/31/2008 01:38:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: reporting work related injuries is tedious
[07/31/2008 01:39:53 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[07/31/2008 01:40:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: so have a relaxing day, and i will talk to you later

[08/01/2008 01:01:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: So i'm going to go out and do a bunch of things, including getting money
[08/01/2008 01:01:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: do i owe you anything for vegas?
[08/01/2008 01:01:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you already buy a plane ticket?
[08/01/2008 01:02:40 PM] bjcullinan: i have not gotten a plane ticket
[08/01/2008 01:03:02 PM] bjcullinan: and i was just going to have other people pay for my meals and drink in vegas since i bought the hotel room
[08/01/2008 01:04:56 PM] bjcullinan: you know Bluray encryption was hacked before the disc even became widely available?
[08/01/2008 01:04:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay, then maybe ill take 300 just in case, and then pay you for the ticket some other time?
[08/01/2008 01:05:24 PM] bjcullinan: i still don't know where to fly out from?
[08/01/2008 01:06:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i think you should compare rates, any of those places is fine with me, you did get my email right?
[08/01/2008 01:06:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'll look right now
[08/01/2008 01:06:46 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[08/01/2008 01:06:59 PM] bjcullinan: maybe we could drop me off at the airport on the way?
[08/01/2008 01:07:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i would rather not
[08/01/2008 01:10:22 PM] bjcullinan: wouldn't it be weird to stay the night with you when you roommates are there?
[08/01/2008 01:11:46 PM] bjcullinan: so where should i fly out from?
[08/01/2008 01:11:49 PM] bjcullinan: and what day?

[08/01/2008 01:13:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: if we are too tired, we could fly you out saturday morning
[08/01/2008 01:13:41 PM] bjcullinan: i just think it would be weird to stay in the same room with you the first night you get there
[08/01/2008 01:14:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont understand the weirdness in that
[08/01/2008 01:14:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: but ultimately you can fly out whenever you want
[08/01/2008 01:15:19 PM] bjcullinan: because it is only one room
[08/01/2008 01:15:26 PM] bjcullinan: and there are other people around
[08/01/2008 01:15:52 PM] bjcullinan: what airport would you prefer to drive me to the next day?

[08/01/2008 11:24:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: that seems like a lot to me
[08/01/2008 11:30:26 PM] bjcullinan: that isn't a good thing when your uterus bleeds is it?
[08/01/2008 11:30:48 PM] bjcullinan: wow

[08/01/2008 11:31:10 PM] bjcullinan: is coming over
[08/01/2008 11:31:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: too much bleeding occurs when the walls of the uterus gets to thickly lined
[08/01/2008 11:31:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh no
[08/01/2008 11:31:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: lining of the uterus happens every month to accomodate a bundle of joy

[08/03/2008 04:50:34 PM] bjcullinan: i always thought it would be really cool to go back in time and be the smartest person alive
[08/03/2008 04:51:27 PM] bjcullinan: but then you would actually have to know a whole bunch of like really core things, like where to mine aluminum, or how a refrigerator works, or the actual elements in drugs and where to find them
[08/03/2008 04:58:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol "just like we do"
[08/03/2008 04:59:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you went back in time and didnt know enough useful core things people would probably just think you are nuts

[08/12/2008 01:56:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think it musta been weird for your friends to see me dance with other guys, like "uh okay she's a floosy drunk"
[08/12/2008 01:57:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel bad about it, i didnt know i was doing that
[08/12/2008 01:57:06 PM] bjcullinan: na
[08/12/2008 01:57:09 PM] bjcullinan: no one noticed
[08/12/2008 01:57:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[08/12/2008 01:57:15 PM] bjcullinan: those guys were dogs
[08/12/2008 01:57:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have a feeling it only happened when they came up to me
[08/12/2008 01:57:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i cant say for sure
[08/12/2008 01:57:42 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[08/12/2008 01:57:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: dancing with you is nice
[08/12/2008 02:07:57 PM] bjcullinan: yeah same to you
[08/12/2008 02:07:59 PM] bjcullinan: it is fixed
[08/12/2008 02:08:08 PM] bjcullinan: but i added in this thing that i just removed for a reason
[08/12/2008 02:08:15 PM] bjcullinan: and i can't remember why i added it in
[08/12/2008 02:08:19 PM] bjcullinan: but now it should work
[08/12/2008 02:08:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay, let me know when you make the event, or you can wait til tonight when i get home. I got in at 630 so i can leave anytime after 330
[08/12/2008 02:09:45 PM] bjcullinan: i made it already
[08/12/2008 02:11:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: asking questions i've already asked may have potential annoyance, and repeating comments jokes or stories is probably less potentially bothersome, but i hope you dont mind me repeating stuff like how much i love your eyes or that dancing with you is nice even though ive told you a bunch of times
[08/12/2008 02:12:59 PM] bjcullinan: of course i don't mind, it is ok
[08/12/2008 02:13:14 PM] bjcullinan: just don't ask the same questions when i first wake up in the morning
[08/12/2008 02:13:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol

[08/12/2008 03:27:27 PM] bjcullinan: do you remember if we get off presidents day? or is that the day we get shafted on?
[08/12/2008 03:27:51 PM] bjcullinan: if we get it off we will meet my dad and sister at the ski place an hour away from ithica in feb.
[08/12/2008 03:27:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha no, i dont remember. but hey, getting shafted during the school year means we have longer summer/winter breaks
[08/12/2008 03:28:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: well for these kinds of questions, consult events.nau.edu
[08/12/2008 03:28:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: and filter by the admissions or whatever calendar
[08/12/2008 03:28:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: in fact, i will do that now for cornell
[08/12/2008 03:28:50 PM] bjcullinan: i'd rather take a week off the summer somewhere and break up the year a little more
[08/12/2008 03:29:04 PM] bjcullinan: it is like spring break is our only days off in the spring semester
[08/12/2008 03:29:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: longer summers and winters are nice for internships
[08/12/2008 03:29:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah true
[08/12/2008 03:29:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe two mondays
[08/12/2008 03:29:36 PM] bjcullinan: i am looking at it in 2009 i just don't think the events have been added yet
[08/12/2008 03:30:19 PM] bjcullinan: maybe not
[08/12/2008 03:30:27 PM] bjcullinan: i will have to try to get fridays off

[08/12/2008 03:45:08 PM] bjcullinan: not for spring semester

[08/12/2008 03:45:32 PM] bjcullinan: oh ya
[08/12/2008 03:46:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: it doesnt look like i have it off, but we have a 3 day or something break each semester not including thanksgiving or spring break so  maybe thats why
[08/12/2008 03:47:30 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[08/12/2008 03:47:36 PM] bjcullinan: well maybe you can miss a class?

[08/14/2008 12:06:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: if it was brian the unicorn, sure i'd love to be reminded of you when my sister says it, but what i meant is that whenever i'd say your name to like my  mom, the problem would be that she would be reminded of brian the unicorn and be like "brian brian". wow what a boring story

[08/24/2008 02:10:59 PM] bjcullinan: not the software from the CD
[08/24/2008 02:11:05 PM] bjcullinan: just download it off the palm site
[08/24/2008 02:11:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: but im taking a break from that.. ill try the palm thing again.. just have to go to the InstallShield website, it's kinda not working though
[08/24/2008 02:11:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[08/24/2008 02:12:38 PM] bjcullinan: there shouldn't be anything wrong with install shield
[08/24/2008 02:12:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: is the software from the cd different?
[08/24/2008 02:12:54 PM] bjcullinan: if there is, then you don't want the verizon stuff anyways
[08/24/2008 02:13:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha yeah for sure
[08/24/2008 02:13:08 PM] bjcullinan: you should need the stuff on the CD

[08/24/2008 02:15:00 PM] bjcullinan: it will ask you what software to sync with, either palm desktop or outlook
[08/24/2008 02:15:05 PM] bjcullinan: and select outlook

[08/24/2008 02:18:13 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that's what mine was doing
[08/24/2008 02:18:21 PM] bjcullinan: you should leave it off to dry for a while
[08/24/2008 02:18:25 PM] bjcullinan: at least a day
[08/24/2008 02:18:48 PM] bjcullinan: but that will give us an excuse to talk online a lot

[08/24/2008 08:16:31 PM] bjcullinan: did anyone else see?
[08/24/2008 08:18:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i had the phone flat, not to me, so its possible someone saw but didnt understand what it was
[08/24/2008 08:18:19 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[08/24/2008 08:18:21 PM] bjcullinan: wow
[08/24/2008 08:18:55 PM] Crystal Diaz:  then the phone turned off, and later i turned it back on and it was there again! im still not used to having the phone turn on to what i was doing last
[08/24/2008 08:20:23 PM] bjcullinan: just press ok
[08/24/2008 08:20:27 PM] bjcullinan: or close it
[08/24/2008 08:20:38 PM] bjcullinan: or go back to the programs screen every time
[08/24/2008 08:20:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i usually just forget to close it oh go back to the main screen
[08/24/2008 08:21:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to get that always on hack on my phone cuz i want it to stay on and i always remember to turn it off when im done
[08/24/2008 08:23:45 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[08/24/2008 08:24:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna get a meal plan
[08/24/2008 08:24:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: so we had a cool time at the creek, there was a scary point where adam was being hassled by some older guy telling him to jump into the water from a high spot
[08/24/2008 08:24:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: and we kept telling him not to, but he did it anyway and his legs survived! thank god
[08/24/2008 08:25:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: we were scared
[08/24/2008 08:25:06 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[08/24/2008 08:25:16 PM] bjcullinan: i wonder if the older guy actually knew that it would be ok
[08/24/2008 08:25:22 PM] bjcullinan: be careful
[08/24/2008 08:25:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: the older guy did it several times before hand
[08/24/2008 08:25:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: but then the ranger came and told us to stop
[08/24/2008 08:26:52 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[08/24/2008 08:27:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: after downloading the program from the website, I got the same error
[08/24/2008 08:27:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: im going to try googling it again
[08/24/2008 08:27:39 PM] bjcullinan: what error?
[08/24/2008 08:28:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: 1607:Unable to install InstallShield Scripting Runtime
[08/24/2008 08:28:29 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm
[08/24/2008 08:28:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: but the installshield website keeps taking too long
[08/24/2008 08:28:36 PM] bjcullinan: well must be a weird error
[08/24/2008 08:28:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: network timeout
[08/24/2008 08:29:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: well its in the support section of palm, so its probably not unusual

[08/25/2008 04:13:02 PM] bjcullinan: ugh finally
[08/25/2008 04:13:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha you knew!
[08/25/2008 04:13:08 PM] bjcullinan: i have been dying to talk to you all day!
[08/25/2008 04:13:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: aww you are sweet. i thought about you so much
[08/25/2008 04:13:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna find the website that tells me my usage
[08/25/2008 04:13:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: hold on
[08/25/2008 04:23:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: going over bandwidth actually isnt that expensive
[08/25/2008 04:24:14 PM] bjcullinan: yeah but you still shouldn't torrent
[08/25/2008 04:24:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont understand how it works though. I get 10 GB (going over is $1.54/GB
[08/25/2008 04:24:40 PM] bjcullinan: and isn't it 1.25 per meg?
[08/25/2008 04:24:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: then how will i wath tv!
[08/25/2008 04:24:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[08/25/2008 04:24:57 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[08/25/2008 04:25:04 PM] bjcullinan: just don't seed
[08/25/2008 04:25:11 PM] bjcullinan: close it when you are done
[08/25/2008 04:25:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: what i mean is, i dont understand how much a tv show download might cost MB wise. If a tv show is a third of a gig, does that mean ill be using a third of a gig of my 10 gigs?
[08/25/2008 04:29:15 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[08/25/2008 04:30:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg
[08/25/2008 04:30:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[08/25/2008 04:31:14 PM] bjcullinan: you went like 24 gigs over
[08/25/2008 04:31:25 PM] bjcullinan: that is a lot of money
[08/25/2008 04:31:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: this sucks, i barely got these warning emails today! even though they were sent saturday and sunday
[08/25/2008 04:31:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: dammmmn
[08/25/2008 04:31:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's 77.36
[08/25/2008 04:32:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: they sad something about giving me a one time forgiveness, so ill call them tomorrow
[08/25/2008 04:32:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats a lot of forgiveness though
[08/25/2008 04:32:23 PM] bjcullinan: yes you should
[08/25/2008 04:32:25 PM] bjcullinan: lol
[08/25/2008 04:32:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: should i be talking to you?
[08/25/2008 04:32:28 PM] bjcullinan: all weekend!
[08/25/2008 04:32:49 PM] bjcullinan: well it uses a little bit, but compared to how much you have been using with torrents it is barely anything
[08/25/2008 04:33:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i also automatically do protein folding or whatever, so i cant do that anymore
[08/25/2008 04:33:30 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, you are done
[08/25/2008 04:33:41 PM] bjcullinan: but i am sure they will let it go one time
[08/25/2008 04:34:01 PM] bjcullinan: protien folding is important though, they should make an exception for that
[08/25/2008 04:34:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha, unsure
[08/25/2008 04:34:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: not sure how much resources it takes up, but if its running all day... idk
[08/25/2008 04:34:44 PM] bjcullinan: you need to turn it off
[08/25/2008 04:36:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: so if youve been dying to talk to me all day, talk to me! tell me about your day
[08/25/2008 04:37:08 PM] bjcullinan: i am in class
[08/25/2008 04:37:10 PM] bjcullinan: :-P
[08/25/2008 04:37:15 PM] bjcullinan: i have been dying though
[08/25/2008 04:37:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol ha ok
[08/25/2008 04:37:24 PM] bjcullinan: school is so boring
[08/25/2008 04:37:32 PM] bjcullinan: i have been messing around on my phone a lot
[08/25/2008 04:37:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: have you seen steve at all?
[08/25/2008 04:37:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sure your teachers appreciate that
[08/25/2008 04:38:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: the orientation was a little boring but still very informative
[08/25/2008 04:38:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have to do a lot of thinking, but i will go into detail when you are out of class
[08/25/2008 04:39:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt really get to talk to anyone, only introduced myself to two girls, but I think I'll make friends once class starts
[08/25/2008 04:41:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm getting comfortable with the internationalness, and i
[08/25/2008 04:41:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'd say that it's 75% international
[08/25/2008 04:42:12 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[08/25/2008 04:42:19 PM] bjcullinan: steve is in this class
[08/25/2008 04:42:26 PM] bjcullinan: he still looks pissed off
[08/25/2008 04:42:35 PM] bjcullinan: he won't even make eye contact with me
[08/25/2008 04:42:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'd imagine not
[08/25/2008 04:45:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: if he left me for someone else, i'd have a really hard time. maybe not the same way as him, but in a way that I wouldnt even know how to deal with not having someone to build my life with. The thought of going to some city and working after school without a significant other is extremely scary to me.
[08/25/2008 04:46:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: however it does elimate the two-body problem, which is nice
[08/25/2008 04:54:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: im organizing shit
[08/25/2008 05:07:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg at orientation someone kept farting!

[08/31/2008 07:17:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: well if i did it through outlook, they keep talking about an Exchange account
[08/31/2008 07:17:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you talking about gmail?
[08/31/2008 07:18:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: like "
[08/31/2008 07:18:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: add a friends calendar" while in gmail
[08/31/2008 07:18:27 PM] bjcullinan: well i have a remote one set up through gmail
[08/31/2008 07:18:35 PM] bjcullinan: so there isn't a share for that calendar
[08/31/2008 07:19:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha i sent a request anyway, sorry

[08/31/2008 08:04:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: so?
[08/31/2008 08:05:04 PM] bjcullinan: i am going to see if the modem link works on my laptop now, there are some updates
[08/31/2008 08:05:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[08/31/2008 08:05:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: just remember how much i love you!

[09/01/2008 05:01:31 PM] bjcullinan: online
[09/01/2008 05:01:34 PM] bjcullinan: whats up?
[09/01/2008 05:01:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: what are you doing?
[09/01/2008 05:01:55 PM] bjcullinan: bout to start on physics homework
[09/01/2008 05:02:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you at school?
[09/01/2008 05:02:20 PM] bjcullinan: using my phone modem
[09/01/2008 05:02:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh cool
[09/01/2008 05:02:51 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/01/2008 05:03:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: Why didn't you text me all day? :-(
[09/01/2008 05:06:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'll just wait until you aren't busy to talk to you
[09/01/2008 05:06:19 PM] bjcullinan: no!
[09/01/2008 05:06:24 PM] bjcullinan: baby i want to talk to you!
[09/01/2008 05:06:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: then?
[09/01/2008 05:06:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to talk to you too!
[09/01/2008 05:06:49 PM] bjcullinan: well i got up and went to eat with dave, then we can back and watched a movie
[09/01/2008 05:07:04 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i didn't use my phone much because it has been plugged into my computer
[09/01/2008 05:07:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm sorry for calling so early
[09/01/2008 05:07:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh, i guess that will do it
[09/01/2008 05:07:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i called early because I forgot you didnt have school, since I had school
[09/01/2008 05:07:49 PM] bjcullinan: i was kind of early for me, i was up until like 2
[09/01/2008 05:08:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh my, doing what/
[09/01/2008 05:11:05 PM] bjcullinan: just hanging out with friends
[09/01/2008 05:11:07 PM] bjcullinan: watching house
[09/01/2008 05:11:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh nice
[09/01/2008 05:11:36 PM] bjcullinan: it was fun
[09/01/2008 05:11:39 PM] bjcullinan: house is awesome
[09/01/2008 05:12:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: glad you think so
[09/01/2008 05:12:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb
[09/01/2008 05:14:04 PM] bjcullinan: how was your day?
[09/01/2008 05:15:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: back
[09/01/2008 05:15:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: my day was boring
[09/01/2008 05:15:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: i woke up at 9 or something and sat around til 12
[09/01/2008 05:17:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: went to a dumb stats class at 1:30, but that guy who is in my three T Th classes is also in stats, strange huh! I sat around for a long while til my Optimization lab at 4:30 started
[09/01/2008 05:17:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: the second siting around involved eating and checking to see if the library had the course packet for game theory, but they didnt!
[09/01/2008 05:18:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i went to the book store and got a clicker and my optmization book
[09/01/2008 05:18:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wondered a bit what my bf was up to
[09/01/2008 05:19:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i thought of him every once in a while
[09/01/2008 05:20:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: my lab was kinda cool. We use a software called AMPL that solves linear programming problems for us. So the class is pretty much a repeat of my class at NAU but in addition it involves software. And our textbook is for AMPL, which i think is weird and different
[09/01/2008 05:21:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: so.......... i guess ill just talk you later then
[09/01/2008 05:21:41 PM] bjcullinan: sounds like a pretty good day
[09/01/2008 05:21:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: nope... boring. not bad
[09/01/2008 05:21:56 PM] bjcullinan: other then the sitting around
[09/01/2008 05:22:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: not enough homework yet to keep me busy
[09/01/2008 05:22:07 PM] bjcullinan: i thought about you a lot too
[09/01/2008 05:22:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats sweet!
[09/01/2008 05:22:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought of how good you'd taste
[09/01/2008 05:23:31 PM] bjcullinan: hahah
[09/01/2008 05:25:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: if i dont get stats waived its probably cuz the course focuses on engineering problems. But all the topics I've done already. Maybe I should be saying how nice my schedule will be when it's waived, and then the universe will change to be that way =)
[09/01/2008 05:25:57 PM] bjcullinan: hahah yeah
[09/01/2008 05:26:08 PM] bjcullinan: why do you keep saying "talk to you later"?
[09/01/2008 05:26:15 PM] bjcullinan: do you have something else to do?
[09/01/2008 05:26:25 PM] bjcullinan: am i not paying enough attention
[09/01/2008 05:26:26 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[09/01/2008 05:29:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are not paying enough attention, but i understand why, so i was just gonna postpone talking to you til later. I can talk a little here and there instead
[09/01/2008 05:29:01 PM] bjcullinan: i solved 1 of 6 physics problems!
[09/01/2008 05:29:02 PM] bjcullinan: woo!
[09/01/2008 05:29:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: AWESOME
[09/01/2008 05:29:24 PM] bjcullinan: i am paying attention!
[09/01/2008 05:29:30 PM] bjcullinan: i just had to read and catch up
[09/01/2008 05:29:42 PM] bjcullinan: why can't things be like they used to?
[09/01/2008 05:29:48 PM] bjcullinan: where we could just talk?
[09/01/2008 05:29:52 PM] bjcullinan: and it was nice?
[09/01/2008 05:30:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: i ask myself that too
[09/01/2008 05:30:22 PM] bjcullinan: do you think the fire in our relationship has died out?
[09/01/2008 05:30:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: i, dont know. I think cuz it was different before we were going out somehow, and we were both doing projects late night, and we were getting to know eachother
[09/01/2008 05:30:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i hate to think it did
[09/01/2008 05:31:17 PM] bjcullinan: do you think we will be able to make it through being apart for so long?
[09/01/2008 05:31:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's kind of like if you have something to do and i dont have something to do and just wanna chat, thats when its a problem. But I actually am working on something now,
[09/01/2008 05:32:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: I absolutely do think we will be able to make it
[09/01/2008 05:32:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you have any doubts?
[09/01/2008 05:33:20 PM] bjcullinan: no
[09/01/2008 05:33:44 PM] bjcullinan: i mean, sometimes i think how sad it would be to lose you, but it just makes me want to be with you even more
[09/01/2008 05:33:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: I just found out that Bank of America charges a monthly fee for using automatic account transactions with Microsoft money.
[09/01/2008 05:35:02 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[09/01/2008 05:35:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: You can think about how good it would be to still have me
[09/01/2008 05:35:11 PM] bjcullinan: unless you have over 10 thousand in the account
[09/01/2008 05:35:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: lame. oh well, ill just do transactions by hand
[09/01/2008 05:36:57 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/01/2008 05:39:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: wait, do you think the fire in our relationship has died out?
[09/01/2008 05:42:23 PM] bjcullinan: no!
[09/01/2008 05:42:28 PM] bjcullinan: i just worry
[09/01/2008 05:43:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: can you explain these worries? or are you just talking about how it would be sad to lose me?
[09/01/2008 05:45:03 PM] bjcullinan: yeah it would be sad to lose you
[09/01/2008 05:45:23 PM] bjcullinan: and next time steve sends you one of his little heart to heart emails i am going to fight him
[09/01/2008 05:47:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: And what lead you to this decision?
[09/01/2008 05:48:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont really ever directly think of losing you and how sad it would be, but i know it would be sad. i think about how i might lose you
[09/01/2008 05:49:13 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/01/2008 05:49:20 PM] bjcullinan: i mean
[09/01/2008 05:49:25 PM] bjcullinan: i understand
[09/01/2008 05:49:46 PM] bjcullinan: and i made that decision last time he sent you an e-mail
[09/01/2008 05:51:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you're cute
[09/01/2008 05:52:32 PM] bjcullinan: almost done! 2 more problems
[09/01/2008 05:52:39 PM] bjcullinan: then i can start on more interesting homework
[09/01/2008 05:52:42 PM] bjcullinan: palmer is so funny
[09/01/2008 05:53:05 PM] bjcullinan: he's like "aparently i can't make you come to class monday, so the homework will be due friday"
[09/01/2008 05:53:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[09/01/2008 05:53:26 PM] bjcullinan: and i said "wait, what? you actually tried to make us come to class monday?" and everyone laughed
[09/01/2008 05:53:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you're getting these physics problems done fast
[09/01/2008 05:53:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol you're funny!
[09/01/2008 05:58:26 PM] bjcullinan: all done
[09/01/2008 05:58:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmmmmmmmm what did we used to talk about when things where what they used to be?
[09/01/2008 05:59:06 PM] bjcullinan: i don't know
[09/01/2008 05:59:10 PM] bjcullinan: get to know you stuff
[09/01/2008 05:59:13 PM] bjcullinan: i am hungry
[09/01/2008 05:59:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh its dinner time there! eat
[09/01/2008 06:00:50 PM] bjcullinan: hmm maybe
[09/01/2008 06:00:57 PM] bjcullinan: i am writing a compiler in php
[09/01/2008 06:01:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: for your compilers class?
[09/01/2008 06:02:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: well my optimization teacher isnt too happy about my request to take the test earlier
[09/01/2008 06:02:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was debating if I should tell him my reason is because of a flight, but then he would probably ask me the reason anyway. so i told him
[09/01/2008 06:03:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: and he said "this is not a great excuse: for large classes, prelims are set well in advance"
[09/01/2008 06:03:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: but he also said we will have a makeup exam and should be able to get me in
[09/01/2008 06:05:43 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm
[09/01/2008 06:05:48 PM] bjcullinan: seems like bullshit
[09/01/2008 06:05:57 PM] bjcullinan: but then you only have one chance, instead of 2
[09/01/2008 06:06:05 PM] bjcullinan: so i guess that is a fair trade huh?
[09/01/2008 06:06:11 PM] bjcullinan: you will have to study really hard
[09/01/2008 06:06:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: correct
[09/01/2008 06:06:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just care about seeing you!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[09/01/2008 06:06:27 PM] bjcullinan: !!!!!!11one
[09/01/2008 06:06:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: =)
[09/01/2008 06:07:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: i fell in love with you when you did "!!!!!11one" in your face book group
[09/01/2008 06:09:11 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[09/01/2008 06:09:24 PM] bjcullinan: maybe an Ice themed party when you come
[09/01/2008 06:09:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg yes
[09/01/2008 06:10:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: can't wait to see you!
[09/01/2008 06:11:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: things are getting normal. I'm starting to feel like i'm a regular student again.
[09/01/2008 06:12:00 PM] bjcullinan: i am going to create a party event for it
[09/01/2008 06:12:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: Today between classes I missed how I could go home in between classes
[09/01/2008 06:12:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay!
[09/01/2008 06:12:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: make sure you put !!!111one
[09/01/2008 06:14:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: after my last class I also missed knowing that when class was over at NAU I could go back to McKay and there'd always be someone at steve's apt and the door would be unlocked, or there'd always be someone home in my apartment.
[09/01/2008 06:17:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: gay.
[09/01/2008 06:18:44 PM] bjcullinan: aww
[09/01/2008 06:19:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was locked out of my Emigrant Direct account for failing to give them my best friends name and pet name and favorite president correctly
[09/01/2008 06:20:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: on phone now'
[09/01/2008 06:21:53 PM] bjcullinan: Emigrant Direct?
[09/01/2008 06:24:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: Emigrant Direct yes sir. When the economy was doing better or whatever, they offered one of the highest APY for savings accounts. And i wanted the savings account flexibility instead of using a Certificate of Deposit
[09/01/2008 06:24:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: it was like 5%
[09/01/2008 06:24:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: but these days both my savings accounts are at 3%
[09/01/2008 06:26:50 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/01/2008 06:27:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: yup
[09/01/2008 06:32:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: we could still get to know eachother
[09/01/2008 06:35:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: once, my compass checking account went down to .66 cents!!!!!!!!
[09/01/2008 06:35:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb
[09/01/2008 06:54:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: hey love. we could still get to know eachother
[09/01/2008 06:55:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: but maybe later
[09/01/2008 06:55:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: that's a joke
[09/01/2008 06:57:04 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[09/01/2008 06:57:07 PM] bjcullinan: youre silly
[09/01/2008 06:57:22 PM] bjcullinan: i am ordering party materials
[09/01/2008 06:57:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: tell me more!
[09/01/2008 06:58:27 PM] bjcullinan: i bought 50 quarter sized baterries and 60 LEDs
[09/01/2008 07:00:56 PM] bjcullinan: you are coming the 9th right?
[09/01/2008 07:01:01 PM] bjcullinan: i lost your e-mail
[09/01/2008 07:02:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you mind explain what the leds and batteries are four?
[09/01/2008 07:03:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes the -9th
[09/01/2008 07:03:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: the negative 9th!
[09/01/2008 07:03:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: would you like me to resend it?
[09/01/2008 07:03:24 PM] bjcullinan: nah i found it on gmail
[09/01/2008 07:03:31 PM] bjcullinan: i need nourishment
[09/01/2008 07:03:36 PM] bjcullinan: maybe flame broiler
[09/01/2008 07:03:45 PM] bjcullinan: i think it is the night for flame broiler

[09/01/2008 07:43:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: all right!
[09/01/2008 07:43:47 PM] bjcullinan: i specifically remembered to order the plate this time because i have never had it and the salad is on the side instead of on the rice
[09/01/2008 07:43:54 PM] bjcullinan: and the fucking bitch marks down bowl

[09/06/2008 08:58:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: Where;s the letter I gave you a long time ago?
[09/06/2008 09:50:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: i love you.. im going to shower REALLY quick and then call you
[09/06/2008 10:03:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: I don't care if I've said these things already. 
 
 The day after meeting you, I really wanted to go to your place and watch that movie alone with you. But I knew I shouldn’t. I imagine I would have wanted to touch your hand. And I would have wanted to stay and talk. And maybe somehow things would have been better with the break up, because my feelings for you would be more obvious and not just-a-crush from the start. I'm glad when we finally got to watch The Fountain, we were a couple. And remember watching clerks and that other movie together! That was cute. And you fell asleep on the beanbag, and your roommate was gone, so I thought it would be a perfect time to do a dance for you, but I couldn’t get the damn thing on right. I won't be using the damn thing next time. 
 
 We should do another facebook status thing. I don't want to lose our fire. 
 
[09/06/2008 10:19:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: i'm fucking crazy about you, in a good way

[09/06/2008 02:58:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was really okay today, then i went to do work with some guy, then we went to the store, then i went to the store, and i just got really sad, and i really wanted to talk to you, but i thought you were asleep and i feel bad waking you, so i tried to get through it myself
[09/06/2008 03:00:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: ive left my windows oppen all the time thinking it would help keep my room cooler, but it just let in a bunch of little flying things =(!!!! so i closed the windows. not gonna open them anymore

[09/07/2008 08:41:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: this is absolutely ridiculous and makes no sense. How could my whole project from last semester be missing, everything I was working on while I was talking with you. With the coal. Im going to ask steve cuz i used his comp, and julie cuz she helped
[09/07/2008 08:46:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: neither picked up.
[09/07/2008 08:46:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: i wanted to use my matlab program cuz this case study is a little the same, but i dont think i can redo it from scratch

[09/07/2008 08:53:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: ill be okay though, ill just ask julie for a different matlab simulation of hers, im sure she saves them, as long as its the same idea
[09/07/2008 09:17:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: its not true that life is indeed very hard. maybe girls just make it that way, or at least i make it that way. it would be nice to have that guy quality. Im leaving soon.

[09/08/2008 03:52:19 PM] bjcullinan: it might by

[09/08/2008 04:32:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: my friend was talking about how her and her friend and how they talked about if they would have a temporary boyfriend as well as a long distance boyfriend, and then
[09/08/2008 04:32:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: (now do you want to pay attention?)
[09/08/2008 04:32:48 PM] bjcullinan: a temp boyfriend, and a long distance boyfriend?
[09/08/2008 04:32:53 PM] bjcullinan: do you want to do that?
[09/08/2008 04:32:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then she was saying how they both didnt really think it was wrong to have someone to cuddle with, because ithaca gets cold, and
[09/08/2008 04:33:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: NO WAY
[09/08/2008 04:33:25 PM] bjcullinan: maybe you should just find a girl to cuddle with?
[09/08/2008 04:33:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i was kinda like wow, and said thats not even an option for me, the thought has never crossed my mind
[09/08/2008 04:33:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol, nooo

[09/08/2008 04:34:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: not to cuddle
[09/08/2008 04:34:49 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/08/2008 04:34:55 PM] bjcullinan: then for what?
[09/08/2008 04:35:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you think for a second i wanted a temporary bf?
[09/08/2008 04:35:12 PM] bjcullinan: for a second
[09/08/2008 04:35:57 PM] bjcullinan: but then i was thinking naw she loves me too much
[09/08/2008 04:36:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: sexual endevours in a sexually mature heterosecual monogomous relationship
[09/08/2008 04:36:32 PM] bjcullinan: i c
[09/08/2008 04:37:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i felt a tingle of pain =( when you asked me that, because i wondered for a second what it might be like if i did want that.
[09/08/2008 04:37:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i love you too much!
[09/08/2008 04:37:49 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/08/2008 04:38:05 PM] bjcullinan: i would never cuddle with another girl unless you were cuddling with her too
[09/08/2008 04:38:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: thanks love!
[09/08/2008 04:38:19 PM] bjcullinan: after such previously stated endevour
[09/08/2008 04:38:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha yeah
[09/08/2008 04:39:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant remember what the uuum thought was about the girl with the nice nipples and possible endevours
[09/08/2008 04:39:35 PM] bjcullinan: it would be nice to experiment more in the bedroom
[09/08/2008 04:39:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: did we decide future endevours would be possible? or not? i
[09/08/2008 04:39:52 PM] bjcullinan: what girl with nice nipples?
[09/08/2008 04:40:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: the girl at the party with the nice nipples! and we went to denny;s with her
[09/08/2008 04:40:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: and she's not totally attractive, but
[09/08/2008 04:40:27 PM] bjcullinan: jenna?
[09/08/2008 04:40:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes i think
[09/08/2008 04:40:37 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to with her
[09/08/2008 04:40:42 PM] bjcullinan: how about nicole?
[09/08/2008 04:40:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: nicole? the makeup girl?
[09/08/2008 04:41:02 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/08/2008 04:41:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, it's been a while
[09/08/2008 04:41:04 PM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[09/08/2008 04:41:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: well, its hard to imagine her being down
[09/08/2008 04:41:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: but its not hard to imagine jenna
[09/08/2008 04:41:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill remebmer this time about jenna, k
[09/08/2008 04:41:32 PM] bjcullinan: i am not attracted to jenna anymore
[09/08/2008 04:41:46 PM] bjcullinan: remember i said she has a stinking pussy because she doesn't clean herself well enough
[09/08/2008 04:41:56 PM] bjcullinan: but she does have nice boobs
[09/08/2008 04:42:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i said something like we could make sure she's clean.. BUT, we shouldnt consider jenna
[09/08/2008 04:42:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: lets not deny her boobs are nice
[09/08/2008 04:45:10 PM] bjcullinan: i should have waited to tell jessica about having a girlfriend
[09/08/2008 04:45:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: you think?
[09/08/2008 04:45:34 PM] bjcullinan: i felt bad because i didn't want her to be super disappointed if she found out after she got here
[09/08/2008 04:45:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe it would have been strange if she came here and found out
[09/08/2008 04:45:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: like, why didnt you tell me before
[09/08/2008 04:46:03 PM] bjcullinan: ya
[09/08/2008 04:46:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i could see it worse that way.
[09/08/2008 04:47:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: so by her knowing you have a girlfriend, what has that done to your relationship with her. You said something about her not talking about where she is going in AZ when she came
[09/08/2008 04:47:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: . = ?
[09/08/2008 04:47:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: why am i still wearing clothes geeze!!@
[09/08/2008 04:49:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: im going to do stuff for a while. stuff = clean dishes, poo, put clothes away.
[09/08/2008 04:53:00 PM] bjcullinan: she didn't comes visit, i think she didn't want to make an effort after that
[09/08/2008 04:56:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: so it was almost like she was gonna come mostly for your pants
[09/08/2008 04:56:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you tell her i have nice pants too?
[09/08/2008 04:57:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: and we are both intersted in seeing her pants?
[09/08/2008 04:57:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: brb agaom
[09/08/2008 04:57:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: again
[09/08/2008 04:57:37 PM] bjcullinan: i can't say that it changed her mind
[09/08/2008 04:57:43 PM] bjcullinan: i don't even know she wanted me
[09/08/2008 05:05:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: who couldnt want you
[09/08/2008 05:06:31 PM] bjcullinan: who knows
[09/08/2008 05:06:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: all i care is that i want you
[09/08/2008 05:07:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm really glad that you want to bury your face in my delicious vagina
[09/08/2008 05:22:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think I'm going to give up on doing stuff to get time and a half on tests
[09/08/2008 05:23:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: it's way to complicated, they want me to write so much stuff and get so much stuff. They suck, but I'll be fine. Cs get degrees right?
[09/08/2008 05:24:47 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[09/08/2008 05:24:57 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to have a 3 way if you have doubts
[09/08/2008 05:25:02 PM] bjcullinan: i want you to want it too
[09/08/2008 05:25:08 PM] bjcullinan: not just you wanting me to be happy
[09/08/2008 05:26:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: yay im in the top 30 of having most GBs out of like 400 DC++ users on the Cornell hub
[09/08/2008 05:26:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: I think right now it would be mostly me just wanting you to be happy
[09/08/2008 05:31:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wonder if you could hack your way into our hub. i dont really know what the capabilities of hacking are
[09/08/2008 06:29:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: =D no clothes
[09/08/2008 07:07:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: I love you too!
[09/08/2008 07:27:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: omg! take a pic of you in your glasses
[09/08/2008 07:28:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: at the comp, not necessarily look at the camera
[09/08/2008 08:56:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i figured it out!!!
[09/08/2008 08:56:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: our new facebook status that is
[09/08/2008 08:58:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: since we havent had anything in a while, if you dont like it, suggest something better! "Crystal Diaz is in a relationship with Brian Cullinan" and "Brian Cullinan is in a relationship with Crystal Diaz" or something like that. I think its funny cuz it's the same as relationship status but better

[09/09/2008 10:37:05 AM] bjcullinan: this lady was just a dumb bitch
[09/09/2008 10:37:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: thats what you get paid for!

[09/09/2008 10:41:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: not exactly in the way, you can mix it up
[09/09/2008 10:43:12 AM] bjcullinan: go to class! if you don't then you will have to stay in school and we will have to spend another semester apart
[09/09/2008 10:43:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: i like it when said so we can finally be together
[09/09/2008 10:44:21 AM] bjcullinan: some of these motivational things you should try to think about yourself
[09/09/2008 10:44:30 AM] bjcullinan: i can't always be here to tell them to you
[09/09/2008 10:45:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: :-I i wanted you to say it so i can put in my motivational document. 
[09/09/2008 10:46:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: your so fucking tuff, im not used to tha
[09/09/2008 10:46:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: t
[09/09/2008 10:47:08 AM] bjcullinan: sorry?
[09/09/2008 10:47:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: you dont have to be
[09/09/2008 10:48:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: its just better if it was with the finally together to go into my document
[09/09/2008 10:48:31 AM] bjcullinan: a movitvational document?
[09/09/2008 10:48:42 AM] bjcullinan: *motivational
[09/09/2008 10:49:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: well, it was something to remind me that things are going to be okay and that you love me and that I need to get myself together to make you proud. I told you about it, but I think I explained it as me taking peices of what you said in convos and emails that were sweet and me compillng those
[09/09/2008 10:51:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: I know it's silly. And if you don't want to be a part of it thats fine!!!@!
[09/09/2008 10:52:20 AM] bjcullinan: well you know i am an advocate of doing whatever it takes to get it done
[09/09/2008 10:54:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: can.. you retry typing the statement maybe that you said on the phone if thats all right with you?
[09/09/2008 10:56:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: I imagine us some day getting in a verbal argument that gets to the point of insults, and i'd be like "yeah?? well your white shirts are stupid!!!" and then we would both stop, and laugh, and work it out.
[09/09/2008 11:04:12 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/09/2008 11:04:15 AM] bjcullinan: that would be funny
[09/09/2008 11:04:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: =D
[09/09/2008 11:04:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: :D
[09/09/2008 11:05:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: you could retype it, you could retype it and think man my gf is stupid, or you could not retype it and make her think you think your gf is stupid, your choice.
[09/09/2008 11:06:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: her as in me, obviously
[09/09/2008 11:06:50 AM] bjcullinan: i am not comfortable with trying to saying things
[09/09/2008 11:07:03 AM] bjcullinan: conversation should come naturally
[09/09/2008 11:08:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: i agree with that, but
[09/09/2008 11:08:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's kind of a simple request. I can get over it without you though.
[09/09/2008 11:09:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want it anymore, it's been built up to fucking much anywas
[09/09/2008 11:09:02 AM] bjcullinan: i have to go clean desks

[09/09/2008 11:13:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: "douche bag" "Asshole" "sun of a bitch" then "okay im done" but that's mean isnt it
[09/09/2008 11:18:39 AM] *** Disconnected from server.
[09/09/2008 11:21:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: Did I tell you that the two meanest things I ever meant to text to you were actually not sent because of some random error, and those were the only times i've had that error? 
[09/09/2008 11:21:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: isn't that weird!!!!?
[09/09/2008 11:56:58 AM] bjcullinan: yes that is weird
[09/09/2008 11:57:04 AM] bjcullinan: what were you going to txt me?
[09/09/2008 11:58:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: i was grateful it didnt go through
[09/09/2008 11:59:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: so why would i tell you?
[09/09/2008 11:59:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: it's not... natural
[09/09/2008 11:59:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: :D sorry i had to.
[09/09/2008 11:59:58 AM] bjcullinan: what was it?
[09/09/2008 12:01:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: if a time in a conversation ever makes what i wanted you to say be natural, then i think you should say it, just so you know.
[09/09/2008 12:01:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not sure i want to tell you.
[09/09/2008 12:01:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: who knows.. maybe i dont even remember what i was gonna send, just that it was mean
[09/09/2008 12:05:34 PM] bjcullinan: uh huh
[09/09/2008 12:12:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: well not mean, but unjustified, something i'd regret. So the first, to put into context, was something like "i love you, you make me so fucked in the head" and i sent "i love you" instead
[09/09/2008 12:16:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: And the second was me saying out of anger, but also unrelated to any text before so possibly confusing, "all fucking night brian!!" 
[09/09/2008 12:16:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: buut i was still a little sad about it so i said it without the "fucking"
[09/09/2008 12:24:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh no walgreens in ithaca
[09/09/2008 12:25:40 PM] bjcullinan: that sucks
[09/09/2008 12:25:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: naw found cvs
[09/09/2008 12:25:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: i need to put together your gift!
[09/09/2008 12:26:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: we also have a Michael's.. that's good
[09/09/2008 12:26:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: =)
[09/09/2008 12:26:35 PM] bjcullinan: gift!?
[09/09/2008 12:27:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes well i cant have all my gifts to you be monetary, which most of my ideas have been
[09/09/2008 12:27:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: and speaking of, you should tell me two or three usb sticks you want and the surprise would be that you wont know which of the two or three you will get. 
[09/09/2008 12:33:04 PM] bjcullinan: i c

[09/10/2008 12:08:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: forgetting photos, forgeting to answer my questions that are older than 5 minutes ago, forgetting that i asked to change our facebook, forgetting to address things that i requested to be addressed or at least think shoulda been addressed? cuz if it is, that kinda makes me feel better. rather than feeling like you didnt care. Hopefully you'll answer this question tomorrow. But it;s okay if you forget, because it doesnt mean that you dont care =)

[09/11/2008 10:09:21 AM] bjcullinan: i notice it, but just because i don't acknowledge that you said something while we are in the middle of a conversation about something completely different, doesn't mean that i don't care about what you said
[09/11/2008 10:10:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[09/11/2008 10:10:42 AM] bjcullinan: okay

[09/11/2008 10:11:47 AM] bjcullinan: it is hard to have a conversation about something in an e-mail

[09/11/2008 10:12:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: its just an answer

[09/12/2008 01:18:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: i;d feel closer to you if i knew you were just as vulnerable as me. well maybe not as much, but some

[09/12/2008 01:24:04 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/12/2008 01:25:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: cause i forget so easily how good it is to be with you. I forget how much you love me
[09/12/2008 01:26:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: if i could just touch you i'd feel better about us, and i know it, so thats why i keep holding on until then, when i can touch you
[09/12/2008 01:26:54 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/12/2008 01:26:59 AM] bjcullinan: it will be wonderful
[09/12/2008 01:27:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: these days i have to rely on reminding myself.
[09/12/2008 01:28:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: and then i have doubts cuz its just me talking to me
[09/12/2008 01:28:25 AM] bjcullinan: i will try to remind you more
[09/12/2008 01:30:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: i supposed that would help, but i dont think that's the key, you seem to do it a lot anyways,

[09/12/2008 01:31:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: are you going to tell me more of "what i felt today" rather than just "What i did today"?
[09/12/2008 01:31:18 AM] bjcullinan: lol the beginning to window licker is so funny
[09/12/2008 01:31:46 AM] bjcullinan: i played some spore between work and acm
[09/12/2008 01:32:15 AM] bjcullinan: and i felt like i missed you
[09/12/2008 01:32:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: what made you say im breaking yoru heart tonight?
[09/12/2008 01:32:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[09/12/2008 01:32:37 AM] bjcullinan: just that you weren't doing homework and talking to other people
[09/12/2008 01:34:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: i guess im bitter about how things arent excatly great and how i feel like im the only one who feels it and so i think it only exists in my head, and thus im messed up. and i do things to get some sort of reaction from you to make me feel better about it all
[09/12/2008 01:35:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: because otherwise, you're just there
[09/12/2008 01:35:30 AM] bjcullinan: I see

[09/13/2008 08:48:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: and the nurse said they dont perscribe accutane because its too risky and an intricate regimen that a strictly dermatologist should only do

[09/13/2008 10:59:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: So i am wondering if staying up for you is a bad idea, cuz you'll probably just be with friends anyways. I was gonna wait for you to see if I made a good monitor choice, and a good usb choice, but i'm told you probably won't care and its my money and i dont need approval

[09/16/2008 10:24:31 AM] bjcullinan: i wonder what it could be
[09/16/2008 10:24:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: 3.5 million for a small!
[09/16/2008 10:24:44 AM] bjcullinan: i said she might not have it off, and she said "oh she will have it off"
[09/16/2008 10:24:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry, but thats the way cornell is
[09/16/2008 10:25:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: I wonder what it is too!
[09/16/2008 10:27:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: im going to rummage something up for lunch. But i am half way through a prison break episode and then i'll start homework after!
[09/16/2008 10:27:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: I love you so much
[09/16/2008 10:29:39 AM] bjcullinan: the lion king is coming to the gammage from broadway so she got us all tickets
[09/16/2008 10:29:53 AM] bjcullinan: you should skip school, the first few days are BS anyways
[09/16/2008 10:37:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow!
[09/16/2008 10:38:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: shit i'm sorry babe, i would totally skip my first day of school, but my program sort of requires us to be back at cornell at least a week early. i say sort of because its more like really really recommended but it ultimately depends on the group members' decision and maybe the project
[09/16/2008 10:39:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: I;m sure you'll be able to find some other friend to take
[09/16/2008 10:40:37 AM] *** Disconnected from server.
[09/16/2008 10:46:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: did you get that?
[09/16/2008 10:50:05 AM] bjcullinan: oh hai!
[09/16/2008 10:50:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha whats up?
[09/16/2008 10:50:30 AM] bjcullinan: yeah i got your message :-(
[09/16/2008 10:50:39 AM] Crystal Diaz: :(
[09/16/2008 10:52:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: how's work
[09/16/2008 11:05:38 AM] bjcullinan: work sucks
[09/16/2008 11:06:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: you said that people are setting up a new something?
[09/16/2008 11:06:32 AM] bjcullinan: computer lab
[09/16/2008 11:06:38 AM] bjcullinan: done with that i think
[09/16/2008 11:06:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: ya, is that still going on?
[09/16/2008 11:06:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: ooh
[09/16/2008 11:07:04 AM] bjcullinan: if i had one of those penthouses i could make like an entire wall a wine cabinate
[09/16/2008 11:07:09 AM] bjcullinan: that would be so hot
[09/16/2008 11:07:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: it would
[09/16/2008 11:07:41 AM] bjcullinan: and one wall could be a fish tank
[09/16/2008 11:07:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: ah i love that!
[09/16/2008 11:08:26 AM] bjcullinan: hmm 33 mil for one place though
[09/16/2008 11:08:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: i believe you;d be able to do that anyway?, or whats special about the walls?
[09/16/2008 11:08:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: 3.5 to 33
[09/16/2008 11:09:21 AM] bjcullinan: the walls are already glass around the outside
[09/16/2008 11:09:35 AM] bjcullinan: so i would be cool to have a wall inside a glass fish tank
[09/16/2008 11:09:44 AM] bjcullinan: like to piece of glass kind of close to each other
[09/16/2008 11:10:11 AM] bjcullinan: yeah the small rooms aren't even shown in the close up, all the jenga parts are the penthouses
[09/16/2008 11:10:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay, i see now
[09/16/2008 11:10:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: they have more pictures
[09/16/2008 11:11:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: like at street level with people
[09/16/2008 11:12:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: it looks lnice but the ones closer to the bottom are definitely not as staggered as on the top
[09/16/2008 11:16:29 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/16/2008 11:18:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: 24 days baby!

[09/16/2008 12:09:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: :(/ But there is so much to look forward too.
[09/16/2008 12:18:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: I have this friend Luke
[09/16/2008 12:19:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: and I get these weird urges to hug him or kiss him on the cheek, it's really weird cuz i dont think he is my kind of attractive
[09/16/2008 12:20:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: hugging him i guess would be okay right!
[09/16/2008 12:21:01 PM] bjcullinan: hmm
[09/16/2008 12:21:03 PM] bjcullinan: weird
[09/16/2008 12:21:05 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[09/16/2008 12:21:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know weird
[09/16/2008 12:21:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think i just like his personality, or how he sees me
[09/16/2008 12:21:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: its freaking weird
[09/16/2008 12:22:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: a little fucked up
[09/16/2008 12:23:26 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/16/2008 12:24:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe this should have gone into the dont tell brian folder, im sorry, i cant control it sometimes
[09/16/2008 12:25:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: cant control the folder thing, not the urge to hug him
[09/16/2008 12:26:01 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/16/2008 12:26:11 PM] bjcullinan: well that else is in the don't tell brian folder?
[09/16/2008 12:26:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe the same kind of things that are in your dont-tell-crystal folder
[09/16/2008 12:29:56 PM] bjcullinan: i don't have a don't tell crystal folder
[09/16/2008 12:30:09 PM] bjcullinan: i tell you everything!
[09/16/2008 12:30:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: you probably do and just dont know it
[09/16/2008 12:30:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: um maybe
[09/16/2008 12:31:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like there's stuff you dont tell me just cuz we dont talk much, but normal not important stuff, but i dont think thats what you mean
[09/16/2008 12:31:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: there
[09/16/2008 12:32:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: 's probably even some things ii would care about that you dont say cuz we dont talk much
[09/16/2008 12:35:13 PM] bjcullinan: so what else can't you tell me?
[09/16/2008 12:35:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: I tell you everything i think you should know
[09/16/2008 12:37:33 PM] bjcullinan: awww
[09/16/2008 12:37:42 PM] bjcullinan: come on, tell me something you wouldn't usually tell me!
[09/16/2008 12:40:07 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i will just go

[09/16/2008 12:41:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: something i wouldnt usually tell you......
[09/16/2008 12:41:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill have to think about that
[09/16/2008 01:53:30 PM] bjcullinan: well did he call asking for sex?
[09/16/2008 01:53:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: he called asking for studying
[09/16/2008 01:53:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: have game theory due tomorrow!
[09/16/2008 01:54:24 PM] bjcullinan: well if you aren't falling in love with him then why would i mind?
[09/16/2008 01:54:32 PM] bjcullinan: just like hot chicks being around
[09/16/2008 01:54:55 PM] bjcullinan: i know relationships with them would be empty and based solely on looks, so who cares
[09/16/2008 01:54:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha, idk. im not thinking you mind, im thinking you would uh want me to tell you, no matter how trivial it is
[09/16/2008 02:21:43 PM] bjcullinan: well g2g find some glass
[09/16/2008 02:21:51 PM] bjcullinan: you can contact me on my cell

[09/16/2008 11:34:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: I've been talking to steve online.
[09/16/2008 11:35:37 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[09/16/2008 11:35:58 PM] bjcullinan: anything important?
[09/16/2008 11:36:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[09/16/2008 11:36:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: just random shit
[09/16/2008 11:36:25 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/16/2008 11:39:08 PM] bjcullinan: so would you rather talk to him, or talk to me?
[09/16/2008 11:39:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'd rather talk to you always
[09/16/2008 11:40:07 PM] bjcullinan: well that's good
[09/16/2008 11:40:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: it is
[09/16/2008 11:40:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was afraid to tell you that.
[09/16/2008 11:41:27 PM] bjcullinan: was that one of those things
[09/16/2008 11:41:34 PM] bjcullinan: that you might have stuck in the folder
[09/16/2008 11:41:37 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[09/16/2008 11:42:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[09/16/2008 11:42:23 PM] bjcullinan: well i am glad you didn't
[09/16/2008 11:42:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: and like the only thing in the folder
[09/16/2008 11:42:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: it was in the folder for a while
[09/16/2008 11:42:43 PM] bjcullinan: because now i have another opportunity to say, i always prefer you don't talk to him
[09/16/2008 11:42:48 PM] bjcullinan: but thats all
[09/16/2008 11:44:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i kept if from you because i know you prefer i dont talk to him, and when i do it ,i always have a bad shouldnt-be-doing-this feeling
[09/16/2008 11:44:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: but I didnt want to hurt you
[09/16/2008 11:44:43 PM] bjcullinan: maybe that's because you shouldn't be doing it?
[09/16/2008 11:44:53 PM] bjcullinan: i mean i guess i just don't understand the appeal
[09/16/2008 11:45:02 PM] bjcullinan: i don't really care to talk to my exes
[09/16/2008 11:45:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: at least i shouldnt be doing it without you knowing
[09/16/2008 11:45:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's just always there.
[09/16/2008 11:45:53 PM] bjcullinan: that's not true
[09/16/2008 11:46:05 PM] bjcullinan: he has classes
[09/16/2008 11:46:08 PM] bjcullinan: he can't always be there
[09/16/2008 11:46:15 PM] bjcullinan: he just happens to be there when i am not
[09/16/2008 11:46:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: no he happens to be there when im on too
[09/16/2008 11:46:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: and want someone to talk to
[09/16/2008 11:46:56 PM] bjcullinan: so you don't just talk to him when i am not available
[09/16/2008 11:47:02 PM] bjcullinan: that is probably worse
[09/16/2008 11:47:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i talk to him whenever i feel like it
[09/16/2008 11:47:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: not because you arent available
[09/16/2008 11:47:36 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/16/2008 11:47:46 PM] bjcullinan: so you don't care that i prefer that you not talk to him?
[09/16/2008 11:49:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: No. i care. just not enough to keep me from doing it, but enough to make me feel guilty when i do it
[09/16/2008 11:49:38 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that seems to be one of our problems, i know you care about my opinion on things, but it weighs about a feather
[09/16/2008 11:49:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know. I couldnt keep it from you any longer, its been killing me all week
[09/16/2008 11:50:07 PM] bjcullinan: what i think matter, but hardly matters at all
[09/16/2008 11:50:28 PM] bjcullinan: *matters
[09/16/2008 11:50:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: everything you say really really matters to me. more than anyone else! but when i make a decision i also have to take my own opinion into account
[09/16/2008 11:51:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can see how you think that
[09/16/2008 11:51:33 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, there seems to be a lot of evidence supporting what i just said
[09/16/2008 11:52:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: but it's not true, and i really hope you can see past the evidence to realize your opinion means a ridiculous amount to me
[09/16/2008 11:52:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: it hurts that you think otherwise, but i still can see why you think that
[09/16/2008 11:52:23 PM] bjcullinan: but not enough to change your mind?
[09/16/2008 11:52:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think i should ask for the evidence
[09/16/2008 11:52:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i am tempted to ask
[09/16/2008 11:52:47 PM] bjcullinan: let me put it this way, if you told me to stop doing something i would try my hardest not to do it
[09/16/2008 11:53:01 PM] bjcullinan: and stop talking to a person would be easy
[09/16/2008 11:53:18 PM] bjcullinan: i mean all you have to do is look further down your buddy list and find someone else to talk to
[09/16/2008 11:53:23 PM] bjcullinan: easy
[09/16/2008 11:53:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i usually dont have to change my mind, i usually agree with you, or change my mind yes, but rarely do i go against you, and you just see the times when i go against you because those are most noticable
[09/16/2008 11:54:27 PM] bjcullinan: i suppose that's true
[09/16/2008 11:54:58 PM] bjcullinan: but it doesn't change that i feel you don't seem to care enough to change
[09/16/2008 11:55:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: are we just talking about the steve thing?
[09/16/2008 11:55:58 PM] bjcullinan: thats the main thing
[09/16/2008 11:58:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i absolutely care... about everything you say. but, as easy as it would be for me to not talk to him, i dont really understand the logic behing this particular opinion of yours. Which, actually, is that you prefer not, you never said dont.
[09/16/2008 11:58:38 PM] bjcullinan: just because we seem to talk about it every time it comes up
[09/16/2008 11:59:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to be on the same level as you
[09/17/2008 12:00:18 AM] bjcullinan: and the logic is, i just don't think it is healthy, not for you, because you feel guilty about it, not for my because i DON'T like the guy, and not for him because he needs to learn to grow up and move on, and maintaining a relationship with you isn't going to help him do that
[09/17/2008 12:00:29 AM] bjcullinan: *not for me
[09/17/2008 12:00:50 AM] bjcullinan: is that enough logic?
[09/17/2008 12:00:56 AM] bjcullinan: because i have more
[09/17/2008 12:01:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: you have more?
[09/17/2008 12:01:23 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/17/2008 12:02:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: okay
[09/17/2008 12:02:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: your logic is sound i see
[09/17/2008 12:03:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: but
[09/17/2008 12:03:56 AM] bjcullinan: i think he is a dick, even before we started dating he was just kind of bland and never made an effort to speak to me, he is selfish as evident by all the emails he sends you.  it's bad for him because every time you talk to him you are giving him hope that someday you can be together again, or hope that as soon as i fuck things up you will come running back to him.  and bad for you because it is hurting my feelings, and when i am sad i make you sad, and it makes me want to not deal with you.
[09/17/2008 12:04:18 AM] bjcullinan: but that is why i prefer you not talk to him
[09/17/2008 12:04:32 AM] bjcullinan: so if you want to keep doing it, and disappointing me, then that's ok too
[09/17/2008 12:05:19 AM] bjcullinan: you know i love you, but i am not perfect, some things get to me
[09/17/2008 12:06:12 AM] bjcullinan: this is one of those things that i feel will keep building up and building up until i can't take it anymore
[09/17/2008 12:06:16 AM] bjcullinan: like a pet peeve
[09/17/2008 12:06:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know what to do
[09/17/2008 12:08:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: because i want to come home and sit down, and try to do hw and chat with ppl, but he is usually the only person i know well enough to care to talk to, and he is there when im there, and i need someone to talk to!
[09/17/2008 12:09:25 AM] bjcullinan: then talk to steve
[09/17/2008 12:09:48 AM] bjcullinan: i don't care anymore
[09/17/2008 12:09:56 AM] bjcullinan: i just thought you should know how i feel
[09/17/2008 12:09:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like it used to be that way with you
[09/17/2008 12:10:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: i come home and you were always there
[09/17/2008 12:10:25 AM] bjcullinan: because we didn't have school

[09/18/2008 04:05:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz i was walking to class and i saw one of those screens that changes slides every half minute or so, and I saw one for an info session with ZS Associates about what consulting is and what isn't, and I wrote it down quickly but it switched too fast, and i wrote down 7pm but it was actually 6 pm so i missed it

[09/22/2008 12:06:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: on the lab computer i right cliked the z drive and went to properties and looked around , i found an address but didnt write it down

[09/22/2008 12:10:24 PM] bjcullinan: if you know the address you can just right click My Computer and select Map Network Drive.  Then it should prompt you for a username and password, you have to type in their domain\username and enter your password
[09/22/2008 12:10:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[09/22/2008 12:10:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok

[09/23/2008 11:44:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: but it kept giving me an error about getting something from the clipboard still, so i just highlighted the excel cells i wanted a picture of and did a copy paste in paint and it worked
[09/23/2008 11:45:06 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, i have that problem too, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't, i have no idea why

[09/23/2008 11:45:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol ok.. these fucking figures keep going whereever the fuck they want on my page and messing up my paragraphs

[09/24/2008 12:50:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: we argued a lot, mostly me against them
[09/24/2008 12:51:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: i actually raised my voice to a normal level!
[09/24/2008 12:51:15 AM] bjcullinan: wow!
[09/24/2008 12:52:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: luke thinks maybe my head or ears are perpetually stuffed up so when i think im talking nomrally im really talking quietly, and he says i should try to raise my voice by 50% in everything i say. but its hard!!!
[09/24/2008 12:54:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: i hate when word decides to put lines on the next page even though there is totally room for them on the previous page. LIke if its one or two lines of a paragraph it refuses to have those one or two lines on the end of one page and puts em on the next with the rest of the paragraph
[09/24/2008 12:56:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: is okay tho!!@!
[09/24/2008 01:02:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: ugh! stupid, 2 sentences can fit!

[09/24/2008 07:03:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah from Northrop GRumman
[09/24/2008 07:04:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: i told you i was invited to omsethin
[09/24/2008 07:04:11 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/24/2008 07:04:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: then i asked if there were any other dates
[09/24/2008 07:04:34 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i remember
[09/24/2008 07:04:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: and he said "My recommendation is to accept the early offer. We tend to make more offers of employment from the earlier events, and then use the later ones to fine tune where we're at in the hiring process. However, the other dates are Nov 6-7 and Dec 4-5."
[09/24/2008 07:05:25 PM] bjcullinan: so?
[09/24/2008 07:05:28 PM] bjcullinan: is that bad?
[09/24/2008 07:05:50 PM] bjcullinan: they are offereing you a tour, not a job
[09/24/2008 07:05:56 PM] bjcullinan: bfd, right?
[09/24/2008 07:06:38 PM] bjcullinan: I think you need to get on the phone with the original person that sent you the offer
[09/24/2008 07:08:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: its basically a 2nd interview
[09/24/2008 07:09:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: and without it i cant get a job
[09/24/2008 07:09:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: the original person is just a secretary lady
[09/24/2008 07:09:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: this is what the recruiter said
[09/24/2008 07:09:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: just forget it
[09/24/2008 07:11:19 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/24/2008 07:11:30 PM] bjcullinan: but you think changing the date would be a problem?
[09/24/2008 07:11:50 PM] bjcullinan: why not just call the secretary and talk about a different date?
[09/24/2008 07:11:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah!
[09/24/2008 07:11:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: forget it
[09/24/2008 07:12:20 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[09/24/2008 07:12:35 PM] bjcullinan: this is important, why don't you want to talk about it?
[09/24/2008 07:12:40 PM] bjcullinan: am i missing something?
[09/24/2008 07:14:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not a bfd?
[09/24/2008 07:15:13 PM] bjcullinan: well is it or isn't it? that's why i put the question mark, are you really interested in the job?
[09/24/2008 07:15:21 PM] bjcullinan: do you want to just blow it off?
[09/24/2008 07:15:42 PM] bjcullinan: what are you doing?
[09/24/2008 07:15:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: being angry at you
[09/24/2008 07:15:52 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[09/24/2008 07:16:22 PM] bjcullinan: i am confused
[09/24/2008 07:16:52 PM] bjcullinan: so you can stop talking to me, or explain why
[09/24/2008 07:16:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not angry with you
[09/24/2008 07:17:10 PM] bjcullinan: and since it is taking you so long to respond i guess we should just stop talking

[09/24/2008 07:37:25 PM] bjcullinan: So are you going to change the flight?  Since they don't want you to reschedule apparently?
[09/24/2008 07:37:38 PM] bjcullinan: i didn't know that you wanted a shot at the job
[09/24/2008 07:37:55 PM] bjcullinan: there are so many jobs, what makes this one so important?
[09/24/2008 07:38:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was just trying to extend to you the fact that im sad that by me missing the Oct 9&10 one, i have a lesser chance of getting a job offer

[09/29/2008 12:11:04 PM] bjcullinan: I think you should wait on the accutane until you are completely sure.  In the workplace i don't think it would be as bad because you usually end up working on the same project for weeks and you don't usually have homework.  Also your social cricle is probably smaller and you don't have worry about the friends you don't see as often asking questions about your face.  i don't think you want to make cornell and being apart any harder then it already is.

[09/29/2008 05:07:33 PM] bjcullinan: cover letter?
[09/29/2008 05:07:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, its optiuonal but probably a good idea
[09/29/2008 05:07:52 PM] bjcullinan: for what?
[09/29/2008 05:07:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: Im doing it for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
[09/29/2008 05:08:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think a federally funded research and development center would be cool, dont you?
[09/29/2008 05:08:36 PM] bjcullinan: what do they do?
[09/29/2008 05:09:06 PM] bjcullinan: i would do advanced robotics programming, most government funded stuff is boring!
[09/29/2008 05:09:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: Lincoln Laboratory has a focused commitment to research and development, with an emphasis on building prototypes and demonstrating operational systems under live test conditions that meet real-world requirements.  Three areas constitute the core of the work performed at Lincoln Laboratory:  sensors, information extraction (signal processing and embedded computing), and communications, all supported by a broad research base in advanced electronics.  The research and development activities at the Laboratory are encompassed under six primary mission areas:  space control, air and missile defense technology; communications and information technology; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and technology; advanced electronics technology: and homeland security. 
[09/29/2008 05:09:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh

[09/29/2008 05:19:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ugh this cover letter is taking too long. I dont think im gonna do it anymore

[09/29/2008 05:37:28 PM] bjcullinan: there are lots of girls in the lab today
[09/29/2008 05:37:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: sexy
[09/29/2008 05:38:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i got an email from the lady who reimburses for going over the network usage.. she's asking if im super serial that i want to be reimbursed for 85 bucks given that she has seen bills in the thousands due to viruses
[09/29/2008 05:39:07 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm
[09/29/2008 05:39:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: my  point is... how would one get a virus? I dont think I've ever gotten one, what are the chances that I would get one and get my bandwith used up ridiculously
[09/29/2008 05:39:30 PM] bjcullinan: well if you think it is something that you can monitor and keep track of every day then i think you should
[09/29/2008 05:39:40 PM] bjcullinan: otherwise i guess it is always a possibility
[09/29/2008 05:39:48 PM] bjcullinan: you have to be computer retarded to get a virus
[09/29/2008 05:39:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[09/29/2008 05:40:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: hav eyou gotten a virus?
[09/29/2008 05:40:10 PM] bjcullinan: but do you think you can check your bandwidth usage every other day or whenever you download something?
[09/29/2008 05:40:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: yar
[09/29/2008 05:40:45 PM] bjcullinan: i have gotten one, but it was on purpose, i was testing how much it could compromise my network before i rebuilt my computer
[09/29/2008 05:40:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol geeze
[09/29/2008 05:40:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: baby i want you so bad

[09/29/2008 05:46:08 PM] bjcullinan: i was just wondering if you had considered these things
[09/29/2008 05:46:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have
[09/29/2008 05:46:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i havent had the guts to talk to you about it tho
[09/29/2008 05:46:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought about it in my head
[09/29/2008 05:46:30 PM] bjcullinan: well you know me, i am pretty easy going, lets just see how things turn out
[09/29/2008 05:46:48 PM] bjcullinan: i will have to allocate some more desk space
[09/29/2008 05:46:58 PM] bjcullinan: i need more monitor mounts :-!

[09/29/2008 05:48:30 PM] bjcullinan: there was a really tall chick in here
[09/29/2008 05:48:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: creepy
[09/29/2008 05:48:44 PM] bjcullinan: she was probably 6'4
[09/29/2008 05:48:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not gonna do the modeling thing speaking of tall
[09/29/2008 05:48:53 PM] bjcullinan: but she was pretty, and thin
[09/29/2008 05:48:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: was she lanky and skinny
[09/29/2008 05:49:08 PM] bjcullinan: why aren't you going to model!?
[09/29/2008 05:49:12 PM] bjcullinan: sounds like fun!
[09/29/2008 05:49:18 PM] bjcullinan: you could learn a few things

[09/29/2008 05:49:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: well because..
[09/29/2008 05:49:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh its just runway modeling i think
[09/29/2008 05:50:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmmm maybe print for the foreverness of it
[09/29/2008 05:50:20 PM] bjcullinan: that's still hot
[09/29/2008 05:50:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: anyway, because I have scars on my arm and i dont have a model face
[09/29/2008 05:51:18 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm
[09/29/2008 05:51:29 PM] bjcullinan: maybe with accutane you would have a model face
[09/29/2008 05:51:48 PM] bjcullinan: aren't you curious to know what you will look and feel like with clear skin?
[09/29/2008 05:52:03 PM] bjcullinan: and if you only have to do it once....
[09/29/2008 05:52:12 PM] bjcullinan: and if insurance is going to pay for it....
[09/29/2008 05:52:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: but you aid!
[09/29/2008 05:52:23 PM] bjcullinan: i want to get a mole frozen off

[09/29/2008 05:52:42 PM] bjcullinan: yeah?
[09/29/2008 05:53:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: but you said something to the effect of... i should consider waiting
[09/29/2008 05:53:08 PM] bjcullinan: do you think it would be worth a few months of pain to have 20+ years of clear skin?
[09/29/2008 05:53:28 PM] bjcullinan: i just thought you should consider both options
[09/29/2008 05:53:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[09/29/2008 05:53:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: but yah the timing sucks
[09/29/2008 05:53:54 PM] bjcullinan: maybe next summer you can find a job with health insurance

[09/29/2008 05:54:28 PM] bjcullinan: the hospital might offer something, i mean you can't live without health insurance, what if something happened? i would go crazy
[09/29/2008 05:54:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: but.. i thought of making my own accutane journal =)
[09/29/2008 05:54:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill call jenny
[09/29/2008 05:54:48 PM] bjcullinan: good idea
[09/29/2008 05:54:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: ive lived without health insurance for years!
[09/29/2008 05:55:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: just cant bunjee jump
[09/29/2008 05:55:17 PM] bjcullinan: maybe the journals are only the worst of the worst, you should talk to the dermatologist about it
[09/29/2008 05:55:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: people write journals from the beginning, so it can go either way, its not a "OMG my experience has been so bad let me tell you about it!!"
[09/29/2008 05:58:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: she said 32 hrs is min for health insurance and that i shouldnt do housekeeping, i could porbably get a job as an MRI tech
[09/29/2008 05:58:54 PM] bjcullinan: i think you would look even hotter without acne!
[09/29/2008 05:58:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: nician
[09/29/2008 05:59:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol is that your final answer
[09/29/2008 06:00:23 PM] bjcullinan: it's been my answer all along, if you can reasonably improve something you don't like about your physical appearance, and you don't have to pay for it, then you should
[09/29/2008 06:00:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: in a way i feel like maybe those people in the journals had worse acne in the first place, so that might make me have less breakouts as they do, but there still is the other things to worry about. nails hair cholestorol metabolism/weight ( ?) joints lips dryness brian skin syndrome shit shit shit
[09/29/2008 06:01:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: (because accutane makes acne worse in the first month or two it seems)
[09/29/2008 06:02:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: she said i shouldnt limit myself to stupid jobs like housekeeping or blockbuster, and if i look i can probably find a real job in flagstaff if even just for a year
[09/29/2008 06:02:23 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/29/2008 06:02:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: ive looked a little, but nothing so far
[09/29/2008 06:02:26 PM] bjcullinan: like usgs
[09/29/2008 06:02:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think so huney, well maybe if i go through their site, going through cornell they want more sciencey or cs people
[09/29/2008 06:03:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can be adminstrative staff!
[09/29/2008 06:03:56 PM] bjcullinan: yeah!
[09/29/2008 06:04:06 PM] bjcullinan: how is OR not sciency?
[09/29/2008 06:04:13 PM] bjcullinan: did you talk to them at all?
[09/29/2008 06:04:28 PM] bjcullinan: or just stupid school reps that would save those jobs for their department
[09/29/2008 06:04:29 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[09/29/2008 06:04:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: steve would hate me working at USGS lol.
[09/29/2008 06:04:51 PM] bjcullinan: steve is kind of a bitch
[09/29/2008 06:04:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: sciency as in i dunno
[09/29/2008 06:04:56 PM] bjcullinan: he always looks angry
[09/29/2008 06:05:05 PM] bjcullinan: no one goes to game club anymore
[09/29/2008 06:05:11 PM] bjcullinan: it's because i got kicked out
[09/29/2008 06:07:13 PM] bjcullinan: i need to start building my mold making rig
[09/29/2008 06:07:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: huh
[09/29/2008 06:08:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: shrug.. you have the good side of the shit that went down. idk, i sympathize with him a bit
[09/29/2008 06:15:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: OoOo I can be an internet survey taker for surveypayoff.com

[09/29/2008 06:20:20 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that stuff is bullshit

[09/29/2008 06:39:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh maybe if it turns out this way ill find a jobby job in the news paper upon arrival
[09/29/2008 06:39:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: im clearly making an effort to get jobs though right!
[09/29/2008 06:49:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: FOUR jobs I am applying for are closing tonight!!
[09/29/2008 06:49:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: cross fingers

[09/30/2008 08:22:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: unless you are in this relationship for looks and sex, then i guess we will be okay. But at this point I feel like i'm doomed for failure. OMG i feel so terrible

[09/30/2008 10:31:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, poopin
[09/30/2008 10:31:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: i can ruin them by telling you what happens without you asking
[09/30/2008 10:32:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz when you started watching sarah conner and heroes, they were already an hour over over here
[09/30/2008 10:32:38 AM] bjcullinan: hahaha
[09/30/2008 10:32:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont have anymore wall outlets to get an alarm!!
[09/30/2008 10:33:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: well i guess i do, but! my alarm is connected to the outlet by my bed.. so i can get it far from my bed
[09/30/2008 10:33:52 AM] bjcullinan: you should move it further away!
[09/30/2008 10:33:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: ill move my charger to my bed outlet and use my desk outlet for an alarm
[09/30/2008 10:34:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: but the beep beep beep alarm is just annoying so i turn it off
[09/30/2008 10:34:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: while still in a sleepy state
[09/30/2008 10:34:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: it doesnt help that i go to bed at 2:30 and have my alarm set for 7
[09/30/2008 10:35:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: your calendar says algorithms is from 7 to 8
[09/30/2008 10:35:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: which is wrong
[09/30/2008 10:36:20 AM] bjcullinan: hmm weird
[09/30/2008 10:36:27 AM] bjcullinan: maybe it is adjusting for the time?
[09/30/2008 10:36:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: nope
[09/30/2008 10:36:36 AM] bjcullinan: no, that doesn't make sense either
[09/30/2008 10:44:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think im a waster
[09/30/2008 10:44:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: i mean waste
[09/30/2008 10:45:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: i shouldnt get on accutane if i might not come back next semester
[09/30/2008 10:45:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: but.. maybe.. i should do it anyway
[09/30/2008 10:49:37 AM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna talk to steve
[09/30/2008 10:53:58 AM] bjcullinan: why?
[09/30/2008 10:54:22 AM] bjcullinan: if you are going to talk to him, then i am not going to talk to you
[09/30/2008 10:54:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: because
[09/30/2008 10:54:51 AM] bjcullinan: k
[09/30/2008 10:54:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: k
[09/30/2008 10:59:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: Brian
[09/30/2008 11:13:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: Brian
[09/30/2008 11:14:08 AM] bjcullinan: what?
[09/30/2008 11:14:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: I'm not a bad person
[09/30/2008 11:16:03 AM] bjcullinan: I know
[09/30/2008 11:16:31 AM] bjcullinan: You just do things intentionally to hurt my feelings
[09/30/2008 11:17:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: talking to steve isnt something i do to hurt you
[09/30/2008 11:17:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: should we talk about things i intentionally do to hurt your feelings? Or is it just the talking to steve thing?
[09/30/2008 11:19:43 AM] bjcullinan: well if there are other things you might as well bring them up now
[09/30/2008 11:20:46 AM] Crystal Diaz: i cant say that there arent other things, but it's hard to specify what those things are
[09/30/2008 11:21:01 AM] bjcullinan: and yes, talking to steve is one of them
[09/30/2008 11:21:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont do it with the goal of hurting you!
[09/30/2008 11:22:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: i can only imagine other things being like slip ups, times when i have the choice to say something nice or regular, or say something that is guilt-trippy or harsh, i might lose some control and say the bad thing if at the time, in my blurred state of mind, i feel like you did something to deserve it.
[09/30/2008 11:23:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: But i believe i've confessed that to you, and asked for forgiveness
[09/30/2008 11:23:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: i know fully well that me talking to him hurts you. 
[09/30/2008 11:24:13 AM] bjcullinan: you know that i don't like it when you talk to steve, and you know how i feel about him, and you know i would always want to be there for you and there isn't any reason to talk to him, but you do it anyways
[09/30/2008 11:24:29 AM] bjcullinan: we can't go on like this
[09/30/2008 11:25:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: maybe maybe maybe you  need to learn to be okay with me talking to him. I feel there is a reason to talk to him.
[09/30/2008 11:26:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like feeling like I have to do all the changing around here
[09/30/2008 11:27:24 AM] bjcullinan: i don't feel like you do all the changing
[09/30/2008 11:27:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[09/30/2008 11:27:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: i kinda do, but that's possibly all i look at
[09/30/2008 11:28:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: my things, not your things
[09/30/2008 11:34:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: i stopped for you
[09/30/2008 11:34:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: or i had stopped
[09/30/2008 11:35:21 AM] bjcullinan: well if you goal was to make me feel just as depressed as you, great job!
[09/30/2008 11:35:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think it should make you so depressed
[09/30/2008 11:36:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: arent we all supposed to be grown up about this?
[09/30/2008 11:38:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: I... think... that if you won't/cant/refuse to change by learning to be okay or deal with it, then i will have to learn to not do it.
[09/30/2008 11:38:05 AM] bjcullinan: i hate the fact that you would rather be talking to other people, especially your ex-boyfriend, instead of me
[09/30/2008 11:38:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: baby cmon!!!
[09/30/2008 11:38:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: we barely talk! 
[09/30/2008 11:38:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: cmon geeze!!!!!@@!
[09/30/2008 11:38:33 AM] bjcullinan: and when we do we are always fighting about something
[09/30/2008 11:38:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: i doubt that
[09/30/2008 11:39:53 AM] bjcullinan: i thought today would be a good day, and instead i wake up and you are sad, and we haven't talked on the phone in days, and i hate being apart, and to top it off you are talking to steve again, after everything we went through about it
[09/30/2008 11:40:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like to talk to you much when you dont talk back much because i feel like its disturbing you. I have no idea whats going on over there with you, and I dont want to bother you by being annoying. i cant talk to you without feeling you might 
[09/30/2008 11:40:13 AM] bjcullinan: i feel like our relationship is doomed
[09/30/2008 11:40:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: its not
[09/30/2008 11:41:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: is it really necessary for you to not want me to talk to him
[09/30/2008 11:43:09 AM] bjcullinan: i told you how i feel
[09/30/2008 11:43:16 AM] bjcullinan: i feel like you'd rather talk to him then me
[09/30/2008 11:43:23 AM] bjcullinan: when you talk to him
[09/30/2008 11:43:26 AM] bjcullinan: i feel alone
[09/30/2008 11:43:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: i need someone to talk to.
[09/30/2008 11:43:49 AM] bjcullinan: i feel like this is all just a big waste of time
[09/30/2008 11:43:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: its not as easy as fidning someone else on my buddy list
[09/30/2008 11:43:53 AM] bjcullinan: when you talk to him
[09/30/2008 11:43:57 AM] bjcullinan: it hurts
[09/30/2008 11:44:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: its not fair that it affects you so much
[09/30/2008 11:44:11 AM] bjcullinan: i have to go to work
[09/30/2008 11:44:13 AM] bjcullinan: ttyl
[09/30/2008 11:54:46 AM] bjcullinan: back
[09/30/2008 11:55:21 AM] bjcullinan: i was ok with you talking to him when i could go over and visit you, or see you every other weekend
[09/30/2008 11:55:27 AM] bjcullinan: now i just get sad
[09/30/2008 11:55:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: i thought we were good too, but how am i supposed to deal with my feelings when you arent emotionally available, it sucks that i have to cut him out to stay with you, what does it say about you when you cant handle me talking to him. I am capable of cuttin him out, but if its between me cutting him out and you learning to be okay with it, I think you changing makes more sense. I don't want you to feel alone, and I hate that you do. But I am fucking sad Brian chronically sad, and i need extra support
[09/30/2008 11:55:32 AM] bjcullinan: and it's your fault
[09/30/2008 11:55:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: my fault.
[09/30/2008 11:56:12 AM] bjcullinan: i can support you more
[09/30/2008 11:56:23 AM] bjcullinan: i will try harder
[09/30/2008 11:57:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: But I feel weird bothering you all the time
[09/30/2008 11:57:40 AM] bjcullinan: you aren't a bother!
[09/30/2008 11:57:56 AM] bjcullinan: the only time i can't handle it is when i am busy with something
[09/30/2008 11:58:09 AM] bjcullinan: but now i am just sitting here at work not doing anything
[09/30/2008 11:58:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: i only talk to you about 7% of the time i actually want to talk to you
[09/30/2008 11:58:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: boyffriend
[09/30/2008 11:59:09 AM] bjcullinan: that's not true
[09/30/2008 11:59:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: it is
[09/30/2008 11:59:31 AM] bjcullinan: you can always write me emails and leave messages, and i can respond as soon as possible
[09/30/2008 11:59:40 AM] bjcullinan: when ever i am in a CS class you can talk to me too
[09/30/2008 11:59:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: i can write you emails saying 
[09/30/2008 12:00:32 PM] bjcullinan: i am not always busy in the evening, and at acm and stuff i am still online
[09/30/2008 12:00:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: "im ssad im sad im sad im sad im sad im sad. i wish you were here, i wish you were here. i want to cry by you, im so pathetic, i need help, why are you with me, please dont leave me,"
[09/30/2008 12:00:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[09/30/2008 12:01:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i suppose i can learn to up the ratio of talking to you vs wanting to talk to you
[09/30/2008 12:02:13 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/30/2008 12:02:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: when is your brother moving in?
[09/30/2008 12:02:31 PM] bjcullinan: and you can send me an e-mail saying that if you want
[09/30/2008 12:02:38 PM] bjcullinan: next year probably
[09/30/2008 12:03:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: does dave know?
[09/30/2008 12:04:02 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[09/30/2008 12:04:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wish i could be a happy pretty nice smart loving caring helpful supportive understanding girlfriend for you. and dont say i am cuz im not
[09/30/2008 12:04:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: whats dave gonna do?!
[09/30/2008 12:05:25 PM] bjcullinan: probably move back to kingman
[09/30/2008 12:07:20 PM] bjcullinan: you are a great girlfriend
[09/30/2008 12:07:27 PM] bjcullinan: we all have our problems
[09/30/2008 12:09:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can have extra credit in my project class that just finished
[09/30/2008 12:10:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: baby. you want me to stop talking to steve.
[09/30/2008 12:10:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if steve needs advice too?
[09/30/2008 12:10:49 PM] bjcullinan: too bad for him
[09/30/2008 12:10:53 PM] bjcullinan: he can find someone else
[09/30/2008 12:11:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: but but but
[09/30/2008 12:11:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: kiddo
[09/30/2008 12:12:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you asked your mommy if it was okay for you to have me cut off talking to steve what would she say?
[09/30/2008 12:12:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol im tryng to press the up arrow to get what I just said back into my chat window.....
[09/30/2008 12:12:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: this aint unix
[09/30/2008 12:13:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you asked your roommate if it was okay for you to have me cut off talking to steve what would he say?
[09/30/2008 12:14:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: brian
[09/30/2008 12:22:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: steve didnt like me talking to my ex either when i was with him. but my ex was a bad influence and a druggie, so why the hell would i wanna talk to him, i could do it then, but now... where is the reason for me not to talk to him outside of you not liking him and you being hurt by it? you say you were okay with it when i was close to you, but i dont think id want to talk to him if i was close to you. But now, we are apart, you dont want me to talk to him, but now i do want to talk to him. I dont want you to be hurt, fuck. is it just about you feeling alone? its not a threat thing? cuz its not specifically detremental to our relationship, besides the feelings you have.
[09/30/2008 12:26:28 PM] bjcullinan: hey, sry, i am back now, had to help some chick set up a computer
[09/30/2008 12:27:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[09/30/2008 12:27:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: idea
[09/30/2008 12:27:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: but first
[09/30/2008 12:27:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: someone has to respect and accept someone elses wishes
[09/30/2008 12:27:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like its probably easier for me to do what you want than vice versa
[09/30/2008 12:28:02 PM] bjcullinan: maybe you should just read what i said the last time we talked about this
[09/30/2008 12:28:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah you!!
[09/30/2008 12:28:17 PM] bjcullinan: when you asked if there was any other reasons and i kept giving them to you
[09/30/2008 12:28:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: but they were about you
[09/30/2008 12:28:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know where that convo is actually
[09/30/2008 12:30:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's moved on, i dont feel guilty if i tell you, and you should be okay with it despite the fact that you dont like him.
[09/30/2008 12:31:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: anyway. because one of us has to make a choice, it would probably make the other feel guilty no?
[09/30/2008 12:33:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: im trying to say i wont talk to him anymore
[09/30/2008 12:33:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know where to go with this anymore
[09/30/2008 12:34:45 PM] bjcullinan: it makes me not want to talk to you.
[09/30/2008 12:34:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: stop feeling that way.
[09/30/2008 12:35:03 PM] bjcullinan: because i just feel bad about us, when we can't give up little habits in order to grow together
[09/30/2008 12:35:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: well ihave to take a shit brian. he is just a friend.
[09/30/2008 12:35:33 PM] bjcullinan: i am sending you an e-mail
[09/30/2008 12:41:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm i dont have to poopee anymore
[09/30/2008 12:44:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i found the convo
[09/30/2008 12:44:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: but ill read the email anyway
[09/30/2008 12:46:44 PM] bjcullinan: different convo
[09/30/2008 12:47:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[09/30/2008 12:47:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i love you
[09/30/2008 12:47:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to fix this problem
[09/30/2008 12:47:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to say ill stop talking to him
[09/30/2008 12:48:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: but its tought to promise that cuz i dont really agree... but im gonna read it now
[09/30/2008 12:49:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol community service lol
[09/30/2008 12:50:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's just a friend.
[09/30/2008 12:50:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i need closure,
[09/30/2008 12:52:26 PM] bjcullinan: it eats me up inside
[09/30/2008 12:52:33 PM] bjcullinan: thinking about you talking to him
[09/30/2008 12:52:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: what you and leah talk about is based on me feeling guilty, im not, and him feeling hope, and he doesnt. im not choosing to talk to him instead of you. im just talking to him, cuz i 
[09/30/2008 12:53:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think i understand
[09/30/2008 12:56:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: he had a friend he called his best friend, and they knew "everything about eachother" and "could talk about anything" and sometimes they talked and i didnt like it. i thought of it as jealousy, because why cant he talk to me like that, why is it that everything we talk about is so superficial, why cant i talk to him like that. i never asked him to stop, cuz i felt it was my own problem, but this might not be the same as what you are thinking
[09/30/2008 12:56:36 PM] bjcullinan: why do you need closure? what do you expect from him? you broke his heart, i don't even see why he would want to talk to you back. when you are with me i want you to be with me
[09/30/2008 12:56:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i felt like it wasnt healthy for me to be bothered by it, and that i should learn to be a better gf
[09/30/2008 12:56:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i need closure from this problem
[09/30/2008 12:57:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: i need someone to give in to be done with this already
[09/30/2008 12:57:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: im hungry
[09/30/2008 12:58:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: me telling you i am talking to steve seems to be the only time we talking about your feelings
[09/30/2008 12:58:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: you robot
[09/30/2008 01:01:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna faint if i dont eat, i like the amount we've talked but if it were about something different, it would be cooler, but i dont think it could be this much if we were talking about something different cuz i have a problem
[09/30/2008 01:01:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: the problem is me and its always me
[09/30/2008 01:01:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: some im gonna change
[09/30/2008 01:01:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: rbb
[09/30/2008 01:14:13 PM] bjcullinan: it's not always you
[09/30/2008 01:14:16 PM] bjcullinan: and i have changed

[09/30/2008 01:14:39 PM] bjcullinan: because it makes me not want to talk to you

[09/30/2008 01:20:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: im back but i should go get some blood work RIGHT NOW
[09/30/2008 01:20:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill ttyl but ill be back.. i dont know if you will be around
Session Close (Crystal Diaz): Tue Sep 30 13:26:59 2008


Session Start (bjcullinan@gmail.com:Crystal Diaz): Tue Sep 30 13:54:29 2008
[09/30/2008 01:54:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: yellow!
[09/30/2008 01:55:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: I went to get my bloodwork to give it to my dermotologist cuz when on accutane they take blood everymonth
[09/30/2008 01:55:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: however
[09/30/2008 01:56:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: they are most concered with blood fats and cholesterol and if im pregnant and they didnt check for any of that, so i have an appt to do that tomorrow. 
[09/30/2008 01:57:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: They are used to working with students who get on accutane, and that I will have to do all the montly tests at the school anyways. They fax the results to the dermotologist.
[09/30/2008 01:59:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: I asked the nurse about the other students, and she said that she hasnt seen a whole lot of fluctuation in blood stuff, and theres always good results. She didnt give me much info on how the students look during the course, but she told me is should just ask the dermotologist what to expect, which makes sense
[09/30/2008 02:02:28 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[09/30/2008 02:10:43 PM] bjcullinan: i changed my status on facebook again.
[09/30/2008 02:10:45 PM] bjcullinan: :-D
[09/30/2008 02:10:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: lemme see
[09/30/2008 02:11:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[09/30/2008 02:11:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i like
[09/30/2008 02:13:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: there?
[09/30/2008 02:13:30 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/30/2008 02:13:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: k'
[09/30/2008 02:13:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: so theres a big deal team project right.. 
[09/30/2008 02:14:29 PM] bjcullinan: are you going?
[09/30/2008 02:14:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: im wondering how i might set up a thing that would allow us to collaborate over the net, like a wiki or a message board thing
[09/30/2008 02:15:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: withmaybe the capability of people submitting stuff
[09/30/2008 02:15:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: or changing stuff
[09/30/2008 02:15:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: how might i do that without having a server like you?
[09/30/2008 02:15:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: and is there a better more technical way of describing what im looking for
[09/30/2008 02:15:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i can tell Caggiano that im looking for it
[09/30/2008 02:15:54 PM] bjcullinan: there is a type of versioning control system that you commit changes too whenever you have network access to each other
[09/30/2008 02:16:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm network access...
[09/30/2008 02:16:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: to eachother..
[09/30/2008 02:16:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: anything less drastic?
[09/30/2008 02:16:55 PM] bjcullinan: everyone uses USB keys
[09/30/2008 02:17:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: eh yeah
[09/30/2008 02:17:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: but that involves getting together, and if its like a wiki i can add stuff at my convenience and they can see it at theirs
[09/30/2008 02:17:37 PM] bjcullinan: use someone else's server
[09/30/2008 02:17:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: someone else's server..
[09/30/2008 02:18:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought it would need a server, so i thought maybe we could just, idk, use the school server
[09/30/2008 02:18:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: is version control system all you can think of?
[09/30/2008 02:19:03 PM] bjcullinan: set up an actual wiki would be useful
[09/30/2008 02:19:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: what would you do? just email?
[09/30/2008 02:19:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: an actual wiki, would that require a server?
[09/30/2008 02:19:40 PM] bjcullinan: use wikimedia
[09/30/2008 02:19:47 PM] bjcullinan: the school probably has a php server
[09/30/2008 02:19:54 PM] bjcullinan: that would need a server
[09/30/2008 02:20:13 PM] bjcullinan: oOo google groups
[09/30/2008 02:20:17 PM] bjcullinan: i've used that before
[09/30/2008 02:21:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel too dumb to go any further with this idea
[09/30/2008 02:21:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i looked up (Link: http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Wiki)http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Wiki
[09/30/2008 02:21:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill check out google groups

[10/01/2008 01:29:35 AM] bjcullinan: everything?
[10/01/2008 01:30:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dropped luke off at a strange place and he said he was going to that food place, but it was like 5 in the morning, so why would that food place be open, so i sat and waited to make sure it was open and he wasnt stranded, but he didnt go to the food place, and i was like.. qwah?! but then i left cuz i didnt want him to see that i hadnt left
[10/01/2008 01:30:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: and ever since then i've been a little curious about why he didnt go to the food place and went the other way instead
[10/01/2008 01:31:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: but it turns out he was going to the Crossroads Life Center (he just sent me directions) and that is where the Monday thing is
[10/01/2008 01:31:23 AM] bjcullinan: you should ask him if god likes it when he lies
[10/01/2008 01:31:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[10/01/2008 01:31:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: well it was more like "drop me off at this food place
[10/01/2008 01:31:57 AM] Crystal Diaz: which is in front
[10/01/2008 01:32:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: and maybe he didnt feel like explaining it to me
[10/01/2008 01:32:24 AM] bjcullinan: i c
[10/01/2008 01:32:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: so he just brushed it off when i said "its open?!" by saghing something like he;ll be fine

[10/01/2008 08:21:31 PM] bjcullinan: i also read lifehacker for cool stuff to do with your computer
[10/01/2008 08:22:04 PM] bjcullinan: then there is slashdot, there is a lot of different types of news but usually requires clicking to other pages, and their summaries are too short

And i wanted to cancel my interview with Exxon to ease the job search situation, but the cancel deadline was thursday, but then i realized i accidently scheduled it during a class, so i cant do it anyway, so i emailed them and told them to take me off teh schedule

[10/18/2008 02:54:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: wouldnt it be nice
[10/18/2008 02:54:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: to have a simple calendar program that..
[10/18/2008 02:55:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: lets you move an event around and it moves a 7 day window before the event automatically, and understands that certain dates are not allowable for that event?
[10/18/2008 02:56:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: it would be very helpful for me right now. but ill just keep doing it on paper
[10/18/2008 02:59:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: event A must occur at most seven days before event B and event C occurs every 30 days, and event B must occur after 30 days but must occur before the C of that same cycle. And A goes before B again by at most 7 days
[10/18/2008 03:01:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: event C i think must be done after some reasonable number of days of event B, but can be as soon as the next day got it?!!?
[10/18/2008 03:01:57 PM] bjcullinan: i have no idea what you are talking about

[10/19/2008 08:00:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think getting a full tuition waiver at NAU is a good motivator for me to get good grades this semester
[10/19/2008 08:00:59 PM] bjcullinan: yeah!
[10/19/2008 08:02:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i hope my bad grades are mostly because of my slacking off, not because i dont understand, cuz stopping slacking off is easier than trying to understand. they are connected though

[10/20/2008 12:44:19 AM] bjcullinan: i can't say that, if we were at a party chillin and someone had line on the table, i wouldn't try it.
[10/20/2008 12:45:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: i see
[10/20/2008 12:46:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: that;s cool
[10/20/2008 12:47:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: sorry if thats a bad question
[10/20/2008 12:48:27 AM] bjcullinan: no
[10/20/2008 12:48:31 AM] bjcullinan: does it bother you
[10/20/2008 12:48:40 AM] bjcullinan: that i am spontaneous enough to try it?
[10/20/2008 12:48:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think you wrote your answer wrong
[10/20/2008 12:49:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: so you meant you would try it?
[10/20/2008 12:49:28 AM] bjcullinan: does it bother you that i would try it
[10/20/2008 12:49:31 AM] bjcullinan: ?
[10/20/2008 12:49:44 AM] bjcullinan: i used a double negative
[10/20/2008 12:49:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: oh i saw
[10/20/2008 12:49:51 AM] bjcullinan: i said i can't say i wouldn't try it
[10/20/2008 12:49:52 AM] Crystal Diaz: see
[10/20/2008 12:50:05 AM] bjcullinan: so it does bother you?
[10/20/2008 12:50:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt read it like that, i was confused by the first part, but now i get it
[10/20/2008 12:50:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: no it doesnt bother me, well it depends
[10/20/2008 12:51:00 AM] bjcullinan: depends on what?
[10/20/2008 12:51:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: it depends on 
[10/20/2008 12:51:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: whether or not im there i think
[10/20/2008 12:52:15 AM] bjcullinan: so it would be ok if you are there?
[10/20/2008 12:52:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: it wouldnt be ok if i wasnt
[10/20/2008 12:52:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: not at first
[10/20/2008 12:53:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i would be okay with it eventually
[10/20/2008 12:53:33 AM] bjcullinan: well what if you were there?
[10/20/2008 12:55:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: well thats why i said that. I know for sure if i wasnt there i would be disappointed, but if i was there, i dont know. I think it would be okay though, because if i you wanted to spontaneously do it then i would want to as well, so there is no reason for me not to be okay. But, i wouldnt want you to think i am bad for wanting to do it too
[10/20/2008 12:56:07 AM] bjcullinan: have you ever done it before?
[10/20/2008 12:56:12 AM] Crystal Diaz: like, given my past, i think you wouldnt want me to do it

[10/20/2008 12:57:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: well, its like.. if i smoke two cigarettes, i wouldnt be addicted and would be able to never smokea again, but if i smoked 10 cigarettes tomorrow and 10 the next day, i would probably get addicted
[10/20/2008 12:58:12 AM] bjcullinan: oh
[10/20/2008 12:58:29 AM] bjcullinan: so i guess if it is only available once then it is ok?
[10/20/2008 12:58:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know how addiction works actually. just that one time in an unusual situation wouldnt make it happen
[10/20/2008 12:58:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah! thats what i mean by unusual
[10/20/2008 12:59:07 AM] bjcullinan: you manages to get addictive to weed, which is proven not addictive, so who really knows
[10/20/2008 12:59:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: has your dad done more than weed?
[10/20/2008 12:59:30 AM] bjcullinan: he does crack
[10/20/2008 12:59:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: i got addicted because i was dating someone who smoked everyday
[10/20/2008 12:59:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: it wasnt unusual or once availabel
[10/20/2008 12:59:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: weird
[10/20/2008 12:59:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: crazk
[10/20/2008 12:59:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: crack thats weird
[10/20/2008 01:00:04 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[10/20/2008 01:00:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: so ive learned thatyou are a guy who might spontaneously do it and you cant say you woudlnt. but what are your limits?
[10/20/2008 01:00:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: or can you not say?
[10/20/2008 01:01:42 AM] bjcullinan: i think my limit would be heroine or meth
[10/20/2008 01:01:47 AM] bjcullinan: but i would try E
[10/20/2008 01:03:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: i wouldnt do acid
[10/20/2008 01:03:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: lsd
[10/20/2008 01:03:14 AM] bjcullinan: yeah i guess i wouldn't that either
[10/20/2008 01:03:35 AM] bjcullinan: well maybe lsd
[10/20/2008 01:03:39 AM] bjcullinan: i don't know
[10/20/2008 01:03:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: meth and heroine, or crack for that matter, dont sound appealing at all
[10/20/2008 01:03:45 AM] bjcullinan: those aren't as bad as heroine
[10/20/2008 01:03:59 AM] bjcullinan: i mean the beatles wrote a song about lsd
[10/20/2008 01:04:04 AM] bjcullinan: how bad can it be?
[10/20/2008 01:04:09 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know much about lsd, but i just heard you can have flashbacks, but i dont know if thats true
[10/20/2008 01:04:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[10/20/2008 01:04:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: i remember singing that
[10/20/2008 01:04:29 AM] bjcullinan: and cocaine/crack isn't as bad an any of those
[10/20/2008 01:04:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: shrooms
[10/20/2008 01:05:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: i would do those.
[10/20/2008 01:05:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: im not sure why id want to do crack if i can do cocaine
[10/20/2008 01:05:55 AM] bjcullinan: shrooms just sound gross, i don't want to do something i can taste
[10/20/2008 01:06:11 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha
[10/20/2008 01:06:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: yeah they arent pleasant to eat straight up
[10/20/2008 01:07:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think these kinds of things are more okay when people are older
[10/20/2008 01:07:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: not in highschool
[10/20/2008 01:07:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: well weed is kinda silly when your older, and normal in highschool, so i guess thats the exception
[10/20/2008 01:09:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know when i would ever be at a party or hanging out with anyone that had any of this
[10/20/2008 01:09:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: so, i am going to go to bed now
[10/20/2008 01:12:55 AM] bjcullinan: omfg
[10/20/2008 01:12:59 AM] bjcullinan: joe is distracting me
[10/20/2008 01:13:03 AM] bjcullinan: he is such an ass
[10/20/2008 01:13:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: how so?

[10/20/2008 01:13:35 AM] bjcullinan: so elyse is still kind of broken
[10/20/2008 01:13:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: broken??
[10/20/2008 01:13:45 AM] bjcullinan: that may be why she is not interested in anyone
[10/20/2008 01:13:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: broken hearted
[10/20/2008 01:14:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: how long was she with the guy?
[10/20/2008 01:14:03 AM] bjcullinan: she broke up with her boyfriend, and he is having problems, and she is not ready for anything
[10/20/2008 01:14:08 AM] bjcullinan: like 3 years
[10/20/2008 01:14:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: people should lay off
[10/20/2008 01:14:28 AM] Crystal Diaz: and if she is giving signs she should stop
[10/20/2008 01:14:31 AM] bjcullinan: joe is fucking weird

[10/24/2008 12:50:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: and me without panties
[10/24/2008 12:52:19 AM] Crystal Diaz: the idea sounds really great, but in general, i dont know if i can look very special or sexy. I dont think i'll have the confidence to make myself look nice. I really want to look nice for you, but with my face looking terrible, i dont know how that will affect me 
[10/24/2008 12:53:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: i actually  have no idea how my face is gonna look, but im more than sure that it will be dry and my lips will be very dry. I wont feel pretty, even with makeup. Makeup looks bad when my face is dry
[10/24/2008 12:56:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: hopefully it wont be so bad, but you should brace yourself for that
[10/24/2008 12:59:21 AM] bjcullinan: i think that if you clean your face like you usually do, it will look fine, and if you use chapstick before that will look fine too, and if you done wear panties, that will be fucking amazing. so i don't think you should worry about it until it happens
[10/24/2008 12:59:40 AM] Crystal Diaz: ok love

[11/02/2008 10:02:00 PM] bjcullinan: totally
[11/02/2008 10:02:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: when did David break up with his gf? io dont remember

[11/02/2008 10:07:12 PM] bjcullinan: the second interview?
[11/02/2008 10:07:17 PM] bjcullinan: i got your text
[11/02/2008 10:07:21 PM] bjcullinan: she did say you are really really hot
[11/02/2008 10:08:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: elyse did?
[11/02/2008 10:08:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[11/02/2008 10:08:15 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[11/02/2008 10:10:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: did she say she would consider something more adventurous
[11/02/2008 10:11:51 PM] bjcullinan: she would really consider it
[11/02/2008 10:15:10 PM] bjcullinan: this is coming from me, she is not trying to steal me away from you, she is just a little flirtatious, and she, just like you, is a little too shy to start a friendship
[11/02/2008 10:15:21 PM] bjcullinan: but enough about them
[11/02/2008 10:15:28 PM] bjcullinan: i want to know how you day was
[11/02/2008 10:15:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: but first
[11/02/2008 10:16:11 PM] bjcullinan: yeah?
[11/02/2008 10:16:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel weird about Elyse and not so weird about Jenna, because if you and I were 
[11/02/2008 10:16:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you and i werent together, then i think you would be with elyse, but i dont see you and jenna happening
[11/02/2008 10:16:56 PM] bjcullinan: i understand completely how you feel
[11/02/2008 10:17:07 PM] bjcullinan: maybe even a little intimidated by that though
[11/02/2008 10:17:08 PM] bjcullinan: t
[11/02/2008 10:17:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: inimidated?
[11/02/2008 10:17:32 PM] bjcullinan: by that fact that i find her attractive enough to date
[11/02/2008 10:17:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: my day was shit
[11/02/2008 10:18:47 PM] bjcullinan: and it is interesting that you said that, because i was thinking that was one of the main reasons you didn't like the idea of her
[11/02/2008 10:19:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: uh huh
[11/02/2008 10:19:35 PM] bjcullinan: and i have heard that thinking just that is one of the main problems in 3 ways
[11/02/2008 10:20:03 PM] bjcullinan: thinking that i would be attracted to her, and want to do stuff with her, and you might feel left out
[11/02/2008 10:20:34 PM] bjcullinan: but i can assure you, you are the only woman i love, i just thought we could have a little fun
[11/02/2008 10:20:53 PM] bjcullinan: we are all consenting adults, and in the long run it wouldn't change the way we feel
[11/02/2008 10:21:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not gonna happen with elyse
[11/02/2008 10:21:33 PM] bjcullinan: then i guess it shouldn't happen at all
[11/02/2008 10:21:34 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[11/02/2008 10:21:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: because i see you and her together, it has nothing to do with you and me. and 
[11/02/2008 10:21:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: and
[11/02/2008 10:21:54 PM] bjcullinan: because i don't think we would be able to handle it
[11/02/2008 10:22:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: it wouldnt heppen til summer 2009, so we dont have to talk about it, or decded anything
[11/02/2008 10:22:37 PM] bjcullinan: it seems like you have really made up your mind
[11/02/2008 10:23:33 PM] bjcullinan: you are right, i do find her attractive, and i really think you would too, and wasn't that the idea? i think you don't like her simply because i think she is cute
[11/02/2008 10:23:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: is that wrong?
[11/02/2008 10:24:07 PM] bjcullinan: i think it is a little silly
[11/02/2008 10:24:31 PM] bjcullinan: if i hadn't have said anything about her, then there wouldn't be a problem
[11/02/2008 10:24:40 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i don't want to do it anymore
[11/02/2008 10:24:47 PM] bjcullinan: because you are over complicating it
[11/02/2008 10:25:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: whatever
[11/02/2008 10:25:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: your the one who keeps bringing it oup
[11/02/2008 10:25:39 PM] bjcullinan: because i thought you were open to the idea
[11/02/2008 10:26:13 PM] bjcullinan: so just forget i said anything
[11/02/2008 10:26:17 PM] bjcullinan: why was your day shitty?
[11/02/2008 10:27:34 PM] bjcullinan: i promise not to bring it up again
[11/02/2008 10:27:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats not the answer
[11/02/2008 10:28:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: its okay to talk about it
[11/02/2008 10:28:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: but theres nothing we can do about it for months and months
[11/02/2008 10:29:43 PM] bjcullinan: i know, but it just seems like you've already made up your mind
[11/02/2008 10:29:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: you!
[11/02/2008 10:30:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: only about elyse
[11/02/2008 10:30:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz i dont think she is pretty
[11/02/2008 10:31:10 PM] bjcullinan: i thought that maybe if i talked to her about how she felt about the idea, and if you knew that she thought you were attractive then you might see her in a different light
[11/02/2008 10:31:40 PM] bjcullinan: and she is way prettier then jenna
[11/02/2008 10:33:03 PM] bjcullinan: but you act like you don't even want to be friends with her or other people i hang out with
[11/02/2008 10:33:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: theres nothing i can do when i live this far away
[11/02/2008 10:33:41 PM] bjcullinan: did you even talk to them at the party?
[11/02/2008 10:33:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe for a second i think
[11/02/2008 10:34:43 PM] bjcullinan: i thought maybe if she tried to be friends with you then it wouldn't be so weird between you two
[11/02/2008 10:34:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: if she tried?
[11/02/2008 10:34:52 PM] bjcullinan: i knew i should have never said anything about her
[11/02/2008 10:35:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know, but you did
[11/02/2008 10:35:34 PM] bjcullinan: now i just feel dumb for ruining your opinion of her, i don't want to talk about it anymore
[11/02/2008 10:36:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think it will be aokay
[11/02/2008 10:36:42 PM] bjcullinan: whatever
[11/02/2008 10:37:04 PM] bjcullinan: it's not a fun idea anymore, i will let it go
[11/02/2008 10:37:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: it is fun
[11/02/2008 10:37:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: but it should be like a doing occaine thing
[11/02/2008 10:37:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry babe fo all this
[11/02/2008 10:38:20 PM] bjcullinan: want to know the truth?
[11/02/2008 10:38:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill br friends with your friends!
[11/02/2008 10:38:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: but  i cant force it
[11/02/2008 10:39:25 PM] bjcullinan: i thought it would be the perfect solution to dealing with being sexually attracted to her.
[11/02/2008 10:40:11 PM] bjcullinan: i thought if you liked her too, then everything would be great, we could all release some sexual tension
[11/02/2008 10:40:28 PM] bjcullinan: so that is why i am disappointed
[11/02/2008 10:40:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: ohy sorry
[11/02/2008 10:41:11 PM] bjcullinan: so we can stop talking about it now?
[11/02/2008 10:41:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not gone
[11/02/2008 10:41:57 PM] bjcullinan: well, yeah, but the 3 way excitement is
[11/02/2008 10:42:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: dude we are gonna go it
[11/02/2008 10:42:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: do it
[11/02/2008 10:42:38 PM] bjcullinan: half the reason i enjoyed the idea is because i thought you were into it

[11/12/2008 11:39:55 AM] bjcullinan: not a length contest, i just thought something comparable in quality as well as quantity would be nice
[11/12/2008 11:40:45 AM] Crystal Diaz: about quality,
[11/12/2008 11:42:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: i havent really read all of it, but i like it when an email helps me get to know you more, which isnt completely achieved when you tell me about your day. I love that you tell me about your day, and I am not saying that your emails arent meaningful in the sense of the content being more than just your day, it's just a comment. I like getting to know you.
[11/12/2008 11:43:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: so you should still tell me about your day, i guess what i am trying to get at is maybe i should continue sending question emails, that would do the ttrick
[11/12/2008 11:44:05 AM] bjcullinan: i think you can get to know me better by the way i write, and what i tell you about, i tell you about the stuff that is significant to me, i don't bother to explain the color of the sky
[11/12/2008 11:44:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: lol

[11/23/2008 12:44:12 PM] bjcullinan: if the lab is empty you could download another file on the computer next to you
[11/23/2008 12:44:43 PM] bjcullinan: but it probably wouldn't make it go faster because i think my upload rate is the limiting factor here
[11/23/2008 12:46:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: My friend told me that when you go to a lab that doesnt require log in (like a library) then I can donwload as much as i want then put it on a portable hard drive and take it home and my bandwidth wont be changed
[11/23/2008 12:46:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i kinda had an idea i can do that
[11/23/2008 12:46:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i never wanted anything enough to go outta my way like that
[11/23/2008 12:46:55 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[11/23/2008 12:47:07 PM] bjcullinan: so even on campus it changes your bandwidth?

[12/02/2008 01:20:19 PM] bjcullinan: hey
[12/02/2008 01:20:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: laptop in recitation!
[12/02/2008 01:20:53 PM] bjcullinan: yup
[12/02/2008 01:22:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: I went to The Pines with luke anna and luke's sister, and we all had good burgers, and I hope we can go there when you come. We went to the purity ice cream place, and I got my mittens back!
[12/02/2008 01:27:36 PM] bjcullinan: thats great!
[12/02/2008 01:27:48 PM] bjcullinan: i am glad you didn't lose them for good
[12/02/2008 01:28:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: I've said this before, but I only half believed it... there's really nothing special about me, I think Luke does flirtatious things to many girls he is with, (even his sister), and I think it's not actually flirting (because its his sister), but just the way he is. I believe it now, and that is significant, because before I thought there was something between us, but now i see it's just plain old friendship. Maybe thats hard for you to hear? but what I am trying to say is that my crush is going away cuz of that
[12/02/2008 01:28:24 PM] bjcullinan: i was thinking maybe i should respond to your email because i don't have time to talk now
[12/02/2008 01:28:38 PM] bjcullinan: i have to go to comm for a little bit to work on some stuff
[12/02/2008 01:28:46 PM] bjcullinan: i'll talk to you later
[12/02/2008 01:28:53 PM] bjcullinan: bye bye
[12/02/2008 01:33:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: the particular incident that convinced me to be realistic and listen to my real feelings for you and not him is when we were at the ice cream place... Anna was leaning back against a counter with her arms crossed, and Luke was also leaning back on the counter with his arm stretched around her lower back and their hands were laced, but i only looked really quickly cuz it caught my eye and i quickly looked away. It caught me by surprise, but i think it was a good thing for me to see that. I asked God to help me lose these feelings, and whether he has anything to do with it or not, i am losing these feelings.
[12/02/2008 01:33:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: i hope you get that.
[12/02/2008 01:33:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: mostly i think it's weird.
[12/02/2008 01:35:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think it's weird and confusing and curious and I could ask questions to myself, but I don't think I need answers. I think I'll let this one pass.

[12/02/2008 06:24:22 PM] bjcullinan: Hi
[12/02/2008 06:25:54 PM] bjcullinan: "Praying in toungues is special to me"
[12/02/2008 06:25:56 PM] bjcullinan: that is weird
[12/02/2008 06:25:59 PM] bjcullinan: you said that
[12/02/2008 06:29:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[12/02/2008 06:31:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: what i meant by that is...
[12/02/2008 06:31:38 PM] bjcullinan: yeah?
[12/02/2008 06:32:58 PM] bjcullinan: I am afraid...
[12/02/2008 06:33:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: im iun a group meeeting still
[12/02/2008 06:33:56 PM] bjcullinan: I can't help but think of how you ended things with your last boyfriend, and the way you must have felt about me at the time.  I am afraid of losing you to another man.
[12/02/2008 06:40:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: it is my view that praying in tongues is a special thing between god and that person praying
[12/02/2008 06:41:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: but it is not something important to me in the sense that I want that
[12/02/2008 06:41:23 PM] bjcullinan: you don't have to be praying in tongues in order to have a good relationship with God
[12/02/2008 06:41:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: there is no other man
[12/02/2008 06:41:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i know that babe!
[12/02/2008 06:54:58 PM] bjcullinan: ok, just making sure love
[12/02/2008 06:55:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: great thanks honey
[12/02/2008 07:34:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: am i annoying yet?
[12/02/2008 07:34:40 PM] bjcullinan: how so?
[12/02/2008 07:35:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: all this talking to you
[12/02/2008 07:36:05 PM] bjcullinan: i wish you would talk to me mroe
[12/02/2008 07:36:13 PM] bjcullinan: but you are not annoying
[12/02/2008 07:36:17 PM] bjcullinan: am i annoying?
[12/02/2008 07:36:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: never
[12/02/2008 07:36:32 PM] bjcullinan: with all these questions and concerns about what you are doing?
[12/02/2008 07:38:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh... well, its hard to express concerns over email and IMs and Texts compared to on the phone. On the phone we can come to an understanding a lot quicker and more satisfactorily
[12/02/2008 07:38:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: you wish i would talk to you more?
[12/02/2008 07:38:49 PM] bjcullinan: i just really don't understand what you are going through
[12/02/2008 07:39:59 PM] bjcullinan: why do this? why explorer the extreme side of Christianity? why don't you take the thing i say into consideration? does it even feel right to you? because if it doesn't feel right, then it isn't right.
[12/02/2008 07:40:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: we will have to talk about that later
[12/02/2008 07:40:42 PM] bjcullinan: of course
[12/02/2008 07:40:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like it when people cant tell when i am talking to myself and when i am not talking to myself, so they are always like "WHAT?"
[12/02/2008 07:41:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: i suppose i talk to myself too much
[12/02/2008 07:41:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wonder where i got that from
[12/02/2008 07:51:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: I always take what you say into consideration.

[12/03/2008 12:30:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[12/03/2008 12:30:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: before i ask
[12/03/2008 12:31:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like i really should send a thank you to your father, but i dont know how i should do it
[12/03/2008 12:31:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: just especially because he cared about my wellbeing on my way home
[12/03/2008 12:31:24 PM] bjcullinan: maybe an e-mail?
[12/03/2008 12:31:26 PM] bjcullinan: or a card?
[12/03/2008 12:31:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: im really not knowledgable and thank you notes
[12/03/2008 12:31:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: on*
[12/03/2008 12:32:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: So maybe i'll get around to emailing
[12/03/2008 12:32:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont have his tho
[12/03/2008 12:33:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: My question is about Saturday night, if you thought there was any difference in how we were to eachother
[12/03/2008 12:33:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think i acted like you are my tag along boy who does what i ask of him
[12/03/2008 12:34:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: and you looked at me less during the movie, but thats something that has always been dwindling, so doesnt have to do with our/my recent problems
[12/03/2008 12:34:21 PM] bjcullinan: i tried really hard to please you the entire weekend, but i was still disappointed in your coldness towards me
[12/03/2008 12:34:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: cold is the right word
[12/03/2008 12:34:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was cold, and I am very sorry, that's not what you and we needed
[12/03/2008 12:35:31 PM] bjcullinan: were you trying to be? why not just act naturally around me.  were you punishing me for something?
[12/03/2008 12:38:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i had an idea that i was going to let you go, so i was tryna make it easier on both of us but emotionally separating us
[12/03/2008 12:39:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: this isnt something i was doing consciously or intentionally
[12/03/2008 12:39:25 PM] bjcullinan: i felt that way too wednesday and thursday
[12/03/2008 12:39:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: I'm just guessing, because it sorta makes sense, but then again it could be something else
[12/03/2008 12:40:09 PM] bjcullinan: i felt really bad, like i wanted to cry and i didn't want to touch you because i just wanted to be free of you like you are of me
[12/03/2008 12:40:17 PM] bjcullinan: i did it consciously
[12/03/2008 12:40:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: I wasn't trying to be, I did think about it in my head about choices I had in saying or doing something, and too many times i chose the choice that was against you
[12/03/2008 12:40:36 PM] bjcullinan: but then when i calmed down, i was laying there in bed next to you
[12/03/2008 12:40:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry i let one.
[12/03/2008 12:40:53 PM] bjcullinan: i thought about how much i love you, and all the reasons why i am with you
[12/03/2008 12:41:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are pretty good at that
[12/03/2008 12:41:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: you tell me you do that when you consider other girls
[12/03/2008 12:41:10 PM] bjcullinan: and i decided that i didn't want to give up on us
[12/03/2008 12:41:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are good at that.
[12/03/2008 12:41:37 PM] bjcullinan: so i put my arm around you, and i tried to be more physical with you because i know that you used to love it
[12/03/2008 12:41:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt notice you not wanting to touch me
[12/03/2008 12:42:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess i was in my head too much and thought of you as "chasing" me
[12/03/2008 12:42:17 PM] bjcullinan: there was a point i couldn't even look at you because i wanted you so much and it hurt so bad
[12/03/2008 12:42:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: wanting to not touch me
[12/03/2008 12:42:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[12/03/2008 12:43:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: i couldnt look at you eaither, like the first night, because i felt so bad about not having the same feelings i used to. I didnt know what to think
[12/03/2008 12:43:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am for sure calming down about the search for God
[12/03/2008 12:43:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess there is no recitation today
[12/03/2008 12:44:23 PM] bjcullinan: thats good
[12/03/2008 12:44:34 PM] bjcullinan: i hope that my feelings for you come back
[12/03/2008 12:47:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: we can do this
[12/03/2008 12:47:36 PM] bjcullinan: we can do this
[12/03/2008 12:49:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: :)
[12/03/2008 12:53:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: grr i bought a bunch of snacks for staying in the labe, but i forgot em all
[12/03/2008 12:54:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: what are you doing?\
[12/03/2008 12:54:49 PM] bjcullinan: still working on compilers
[12/03/2008 12:56:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you imagine you might stay up all night tonight or tomorrow night
[12/03/2008 12:58:22 PM] bjcullinan: i don't think so, do you need company?
[12/03/2008 12:58:31 PM] bjcullinan: i suppose i could stay up late and talk to you
[12/03/2008 12:58:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: I do, but i dont want you to if you dont want to
[12/03/2008 12:59:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: it would remind me of when we first met
[12/03/2008 01:36:56 PM] bjcullinan: Elyse stayed over last night, because we got tired and wanted to sleep before other people wanted to leave.
[12/03/2008 01:37:00 PM] bjcullinan: Nothing happened
[12/03/2008 01:39:32 PM] bjcullinan: I didn't want to betray you, i think you are worth being patient and not seeing other people in the meantime
[12/03/2008 01:49:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry i havent been paying attn to the chat window
[12/03/2008 01:49:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i cant do my homework and the one i ask isnt really helping and i just hate to bother people
[12/03/2008 01:49:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: the times i really need a TA they dont have office hours
[12/03/2008 01:50:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: Did anything change between you and Elyse?
[12/03/2008 01:50:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: was there any sleeping in the same area?
[12/03/2008 01:50:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: anything change since the problem started?
[12/03/2008 01:51:51 PM] bjcullinan: no, nothing changed, we are just friends, and she is still seeing steve
[12/03/2008 01:51:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: n/m i guess you told me that she is still hooked onSteve Arcas
[12/03/2008 01:52:03 PM] bjcullinan: i just said she slept over last night
[12/03/2008 01:52:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: you keep saying things like that
[12/03/2008 01:52:10 PM] bjcullinan: same bed
[12/03/2008 01:52:18 PM] bjcullinan: what do you mean?
[12/03/2008 01:52:33 PM] bjcullinan: i keep saying things like what?
[12/03/2008 01:54:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: that you think of doing things with other girls but then you think about you and me and so nothing happens
[12/03/2008 01:54:59 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, is that bad?
[12/03/2008 01:55:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: you just keep saying it.
[12/03/2008 01:56:13 PM] bjcullinan: I guess since we have been having problems i have been a little unsure of what i want, so i try to make some of the things that i think about a reality but when i get there, i realize it isn't really what i want
[12/03/2008 01:56:18 PM] bjcullinan: you are the only thing i want
[12/03/2008 01:59:13 PM] bjcullinan: :-*

[12/03/2008 04:08:24 PM] bjcullinan: just seeing steve in the room make me annoyed that you talked to him about this stuff
[12/03/2008 04:08:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry hun!
[12/03/2008 04:08:43 PM] bjcullinan: it makes me not want to try anymore
[12/03/2008 04:08:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: guess i coulda just kept it to myself, you did indirectly say i should do that
[12/03/2008 04:09:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: what
[12/03/2008 04:09:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: the steve thing does?
[12/03/2008 04:09:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: the luke thing?
[12/03/2008 04:09:16 PM] bjcullinan: i've been trying to hard to keep this relationship alive so that you wouldn't leave me and default back to him
[12/03/2008 04:09:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont be foolish.
[12/03/2008 04:09:43 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[12/03/2008 04:10:08 PM] bjcullinan: i guess all these feelings are coming out because i have lost confidence in our relationship
[12/03/2008 04:10:33 PM] bjcullinan: i am sorry i am constantly pouring my heart out
[12/03/2008 04:10:40 PM] bjcullinan: i should stop, it must be getting annoying
[12/03/2008 04:10:51 PM] bjcullinan: i am kind of acting like your last boyfriend
[12/03/2008 04:10:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not getting annoying at all baby
[12/03/2008 04:10:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: baby no

[12/03/2008 04:11:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: you said you were going to try and be less emotionally clingy
[12/03/2008 04:11:22 PM] bjcullinan: maybe next time we see each other will be better, i have that to look forward to
[12/03/2008 04:11:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: but
[12/03/2008 04:11:30 PM] bjcullinan: i don't think we should change any plans
[12/03/2008 04:11:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: your emotional cling is as loose and tight as i like it
[12/03/2008 04:11:59 PM] bjcullinan: i think we should worry about changing plans it is it ever for sure over
[12/03/2008 04:11:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: what does that mean
[12/03/2008 04:12:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: plans

[12/03/2008 04:12:54 PM] bjcullinan: and our plans for christmas, they are not concrete of course, but they are good plans
[12/03/2008 04:13:40 PM] bjcullinan: i just think we shouldn't worry about changing plans like you not finding the job you want right out of school
[12/03/2008 04:13:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: :D
[12/03/2008 04:13:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: Brian

[12/03/2008 04:15:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: before i didnt see/feel genuine emotion from you (besides regular love) even though you said emotional things. but now i can really see it from you.
[12/03/2008 04:15:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: like before we started going out, it was hard to see it in your eyes that you are romantic and wonderful, i just had your words to go off of i think
[12/03/2008 04:17:00 PM] bjcullinan: i want to be more romantic, i thought the dates we went on were romantic
[12/03/2008 04:17:05 PM] bjcullinan: and the flower i got you
[12/03/2008 04:17:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont think im expolaining myself right

[12/03/2008 04:17:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: like, in your head you think things how i do, you arent made of stone
[12/03/2008 04:18:17 PM] bjcullinan: i guess it is hard to see that side when everything is perfect
[12/03/2008 04:18:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i found you
[12/03/2008 04:18:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: a deeper side of you

[12/04/2008 03:41:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: after i stopped the accutane and now started the new stuff, my face is pretty shitty

[12/04/2008 09:10:14 AM] bjcullinan: i think your hair is beautiful, i didn't notice any difference in the hairiness of your tummy
[12/04/2008 09:10:36 AM] bjcullinan: to be honest i get a little turned on just thinking about how soft it is, and kissing it
[12/04/2008 09:34:19 AM] bjcullinan: what about that treatment that they use on people in extreme makeover? it is like a little blue light and i think it zaps the pimples
[12/04/2008 09:34:40 AM] bjcullinan: they then wipe off all the oils, it is pretty gross to watch
[12/04/2008 09:35:04 AM] bjcullinan: i don't think you aren't pretty just because of a few pimples, i barely notice them

[12/05/2008 12:22:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: i may not like some of it, but it absolutely doesnt change the way i feel about you, i want to know all of you, and all of what you think, even if not all of it is flowers and candy
[12/05/2008 12:22:25 PM] bjcullinan: i know i keep using past tenses when i talk about my love for you, and we don't really talk enough about the future, but i really do want to work things out, and i know i can love you deeply again.
[12/05/2008 12:22:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: I only mean flirting between you and me is important, keeps the relationship feeling young, and im sory for not being that way over thanksgiving
[12/05/2008 12:23:18 PM] bjcullinan: it's ok, i think because of how reasonable we both are we have kind of given each other a second chance, so lets make it count!

[12/05/2008 01:59:33 PM] bjcullinan: i don't understand how Leah made the jump to the conclusion that i judge a relationship by a look in someones eye, when i simply said that it was there.

[12/05/2008 02:12:13 PM] bjcullinan: i think it would be a good way to keep in touch with our physical attractions is using our imagination
[12/05/2008 02:14:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: nice

I forgive Joanna in my heart because i know she is too stupid to understand things that she does that bother people, but if she doesn't care about being forgiven how does that make it better?

[12/15/2008 01:08:03 PM] bjcullinan: 0 percent is the introductory rate

[12/15/2008 01:08:37 PM] bjcullinan: does that mean, just for using the card you pay an extra 12% on everything you buy
[12/15/2008 01:08:50 PM] bjcullinan: or monthly it is only 1%
[12/15/2008 01:09:08 PM] bjcullinan: or does that only apply if you don't pay it off
[12/15/2008 01:10:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you dont pay off the full amount of your bill, whats left over is charged interest and is added to your next bill
[12/15/2008 01:10:31 PM] bjcullinan: ok, but if you do pay it off there is no extra charge?

[01/13/2009 11:26:10 AM] bjcullinan: i am going to go lay down
[01/13/2009 11:26:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[01/13/2009 11:36:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: talk to me when you are back!!!!!!!!
[01/13/2009 12:45:06 PM] bjcullinan: man these guys are enormous dorks
[01/13/2009 12:48:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: who?
[01/13/2009 12:50:50 PM] bjcullinan: people in my CS class
[01/13/2009 12:50:57 PM] bjcullinan: they annoy me just from them talking
[01/13/2009 12:51:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry dude
[01/13/2009 12:51:52 PM] bjcullinan: it's really sad
[01/13/2009 12:52:04 PM] bjcullinan: it's like they talk
[01/13/2009 12:52:07 PM] bjcullinan: and i hear their voice
[01/13/2009 12:52:14 PM] bjcullinan: and it makes me want to kill myself
[01/13/2009 12:53:24 PM] bjcullinan: there is this gross guy that i just can't seem to avoid, he reminds me of a vogon
[01/13/2009 12:55:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: my wireless mouse isnt working :(
[01/13/2009 12:56:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: gross im glad you arent like any of them
[01/13/2009 12:57:32 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, some of them are like so completely wrong that i can't even stand thinking about tell them they are wrong
[01/13/2009 12:58:13 PM] bjcullinan: lol i remember when we made twice backed potatoes and erika cut up the chives with a knife
[01/13/2009 12:58:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: how is that funny?
[01/13/2009 12:59:21 PM] bjcullinan: i forgot to mention this at the time but that is not how you cut chives, you use scissors to cut the green part of green onions, you might only use a knife for the white parts
[01/13/2009 12:59:40 PM] bjcullinan: using a knife is overly difficult
[01/13/2009 01:01:37 PM] bjcullinan: they are supposed to be little circles when you are done, using a knife makes them all torn apart and smashed
[01/13/2009 01:01:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh, she seems to do a nice job
[01/13/2009 01:02:02 PM] bjcullinan: i was just thinking about it because i am going to make them again today and finish off the potatoes
[01/13/2009 01:03:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh cool

[01/21/2009 01:59:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: love!
[01/21/2009 02:01:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i cant take managerial, and caggiano told me to ask where i am on the waiting list, so i went to the lady and she didnt have me on the waiting list, but i asked to be on the waiting list before thanksgiving and she sent me a confirmation, so i dont know if i will get jipped and be put on the bottom, or if i will get high on the list where i should be above the other kids who barely got on the waiting list
[01/21/2009 02:01:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i could just say fuck it, the class is dumb anyway, and decide to take the full optimization class instead of until the end of feb. which i will most likely cuz i dont want the hassle of trying to figure out what class to take again
[01/21/2009 02:10:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: it turns out i never noticed that managerial spreadsheet modeling was on the "doesnt count" list, I was just looking at the list of what does count
[01/21/2009 02:10:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: and didnt see it
[01/21/2009 02:11:02 PM] bjcullinan: hmmm interesting
[01/21/2009 02:11:19 PM] bjcullinan: sounds like optimization would be an easy fix, but i thought you didn't really like that class?
[01/21/2009 02:12:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont.
[01/21/2009 02:12:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: io have to take the first quarter tho
[01/21/2009 02:14:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: and maybe it wont be as tuff as optimization 1....... i'll just try harder
[01/21/2009 02:14:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna use schedulizer to see how my schedule might look.
[01/21/2009 02:14:41 PM] bjcullinan: sounds good
[01/21/2009 02:17:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: i'm so sad about earth1!!!!!!!!!
[01/21/2009 02:19:07 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 02:19:11 PM] bjcullinan: but it wasn't earth
[01/21/2009 02:19:16 PM] bjcullinan: i think you are great you know
[01/21/2009 02:20:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: it wasnt earth?
[01/21/2009 02:20:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna read about the history
[01/21/2009 02:20:53 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 02:20:56 PM] bjcullinan: i don't think it was
[01/21/2009 02:21:06 PM] bjcullinan: they said all the cylons came there and called it earth
[01/21/2009 02:23:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: who is they?
[01/21/2009 02:24:06 PM] bjcullinan: madam president and admiral adama were talking about it
[01/21/2009 02:24:31 PM] bjcullinan: when they found out the book was leading them to the ruins this whole time
[01/21/2009 02:25:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm?
[01/21/2009 02:25:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: where in the episode?
[01/21/2009 02:25:42 PM] bjcullinan: it was like towards the beginning, before they when back to galactica
[01/21/2009 02:27:17 PM] bjcullinan: you have to help me with my music, sorting out scores from soundtracks
[01/21/2009 02:27:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay!
[01/21/2009 02:27:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: gosh this is so confusing
[01/21/2009 02:27:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: how on earth can the thirteenth tribe be cylon
[01/21/2009 02:27:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: they didnt exist
[01/21/2009 02:28:29 PM] bjcullinan: what if it is one main artists but it has another is it a score or a soundtrack?
[01/21/2009 02:28:37 PM] bjcullinan: how do you tell the difference
[01/21/2009 02:30:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think if its mostly wordless songs, its a score, even though it may have a couple worded songs that maybe were made for the movie, like lord of the rings and that enya chick i think
[01/21/2009 02:31:21 PM] bjcullinan: i think i should leave them all as soundtracks
[01/21/2009 02:31:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: different artists like res evil is soundtrack, and i have to see an example of one main artist but having another
[01/21/2009 02:31:37 PM] bjcullinan: i think a score is still a soundtrack to a movie just like a square is still a rectangle
[01/21/2009 02:31:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah you could do that, or set that as default and call the obvious ones scores
[01/21/2009 02:31:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: trueness
[01/21/2009 02:40:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know, i just thought they were wrong
[01/21/2009 02:40:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: the people inthe room who said that stuff about the 134th tribe
[01/21/2009 02:42:50 PM] bjcullinan: i think you are right
[01/21/2009 02:44:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: half way, i think we'll have to wait for friday and the next friday and the next
[01/21/2009 02:48:28 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/21/2009 03:04:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: blah
[01/21/2009 03:04:52 PM] bjcullinan: dude this renaming program joe just showed me is awesome
[01/21/2009 03:05:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: nice!
[01/21/2009 03:05:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: how does it work?
[01/21/2009 03:10:15 PM] bjcullinan: it can match regular expressions in a huge list of file names and replace them
[01/21/2009 03:10:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats really cool
[01/21/2009 03:10:48 PM] bjcullinan: usually i have to write a PHP script to do this kind of thing
[01/21/2009 03:10:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: you are so smart that you can do that!
[01/21/2009 03:11:03 PM] bjcullinan: and it shows a sample of the replacement on the fly
[01/21/2009 03:11:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: cool
[01/21/2009 03:13:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: okay, i finished my schedule

[01/21/2009 03:31:21 PM] bjcullinan: isn't that what you wanted though?
[01/21/2009 03:31:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[01/21/2009 03:32:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: i guess it mostly just ruins the fact that i just sent an email to our project advisor telling him our available times
[01/21/2009 03:32:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill just have to redo that email
[01/21/2009 03:32:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: but also, what if the class sucks, now its kinda like i dont have  achoice!

[01/28/2009 01:40:18 PM] bjcullinan: just because you don't understand it doesn't mean you stop taking notes
[01/28/2009 01:40:46 PM] bjcullinan: the teacher might not be writing things down in the order that you can understand it
[01/28/2009 01:40:56 PM] bjcullinan: read the chapter before class is a big help too!
[01/28/2009 01:41:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: it was a pdf he went through, i should rewrite those notes so i understand it, but there is just sooooo much to do, and if i am not doing something productive (like including eating) almost all the time, i think im going to get behind eeek
[01/28/2009 01:41:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: but if i am doing something all the time, i am gonna burn out
[01/28/2009 01:42:11 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/28/2009 01:42:30 PM] bjcullinan: just try to take notes the best you can, paraphrase you can always go and fix it later

[01/30/2009 12:06:43 PM] bjcullinan: it just feels like every time something comes up, our relationship is the first thing to be put in question. (find god, getting a job, where to live, etc)  Our relationship should be the constant, not a variable.  i need you to figure that out.  not everything in life has to be perfect, that's why i don't understand how you get so upset about your schedule!  it doesn't have to be perfect, it doesn't matter if you are afraid you won't like a class, you don't even know what it will be like, but you worry about it anyways.  that doesn't make sense to me.

[01/31/2009 05:42:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: its just kind of hard to imagine me and you being the same as before if i am baptized in the holy spirit, which i am kinda  wanting. Without it, i think you are a great person to be with, but with it, I probably wouldn't want to live the same life, and I don't think you will accept that change.
[01/31/2009 05:43:35 PM] bjcullinan: what is it about your life that you feel you have to drastically change?
[01/31/2009 05:43:51 PM] bjcullinan: and why would baptism of the holy spirit force you to change it?
[01/31/2009 05:46:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: its like an awakeing, and a realization of ones own sin, i doubt I can be connected to the power of the holy spirit AND go to vegas for Defcon and drink and dance like that. But since I fear the baptism wont happen, i dont want to lose you
[01/31/2009 05:47:18 PM] bjcullinan: thats not fair to me
[01/31/2009 05:48:11 PM] bjcullinan: every single day there is some point during the day that i feel like saying "i can't do this anymore" and want to quit

[01/31/2009 05:54:02 PM] bjcullinan: and you are constantly changing away from that
[01/31/2009 06:08:57 PM] bjcullinan: i just don't want to look like a fool when you decide you don't need me anymore
[01/31/2009 06:09:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh wow
[01/31/2009 06:12:08 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to feel like a fool, i guess i don't care how it looks to other people

[01/31/2009 07:56:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: now how do i dl bsg to watch it
[01/31/2009 07:56:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: ;D
[01/31/2009 08:01:53 PM] bjcullinan: search for BSG
[01/31/2009 08:02:04 PM] bjcullinan: oh i may have deleted it already
[01/31/2009 08:02:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh ok
[01/31/2009 08:02:21 PM] bjcullinan: sorz i'll start putting shows up there since i got the streaming stuff working
[01/31/2009 08:02:36 PM] bjcullinan: but you WOULD just click on the type of link you want, like wmv
[01/31/2009 08:02:54 PM] bjcullinan: do it in IE so it opens windows media player instead of saving it
[01/31/2009 08:06:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can dl dc++
[01/31/2009 08:32:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: do you know how big the library of congress is in bytes?
[01/31/2009 08:35:02 PM] bjcullinan: how big?
[01/31/2009 08:36:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: 20 TB
[01/31/2009 08:36:47 PM] bjcullinan: wow
[01/31/2009 08:37:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: yar
[01/31/2009 08:37:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: is that big?
[01/31/2009 08:37:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: isnt 1 TB something you might end up getting?
[01/31/2009 08:37:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: harddrive
[01/31/2009 08:37:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: or am i thinking wrong
[01/31/2009 08:43:21 PM] bjcullinan: yeah i might
[01/31/2009 08:43:32 PM] bjcullinan: is that just their names?
[01/31/2009 08:43:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: cutie pie
[01/31/2009 08:44:43 PM] bjcullinan: ya?
[01/31/2009 08:44:57 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[01/31/2009 08:45:03 PM] bjcullinan: library of congress is a library
[01/31/2009 08:45:05 PM] bjcullinan: i am dumb
[01/31/2009 08:45:18 PM] bjcullinan: did google figure that out? they probably scanned all their books
[01/31/2009 08:46:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: its in my information technology book when it talks about bits as units of information
[01/31/2009 08:46:51 PM] bjcullinan: cool!
[01/31/2009 08:54:50 PM] bjcullinan: actually i'm a little surprised it is only 20 TB
[01/31/2009 08:55:00 PM] bjcullinan: but text doesn't take up that much space
[01/31/2009 08:55:09 PM] bjcullinan: it's only 1 byte for every letter
[01/31/2009 08:55:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: bit
[01/31/2009 08:55:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[01/31/2009 08:55:24 PM] bjcullinan: and 2 bytes for letters from a different language
[01/31/2009 08:55:34 PM] bjcullinan: no a byte is 8 bits
[01/31/2009 08:56:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: actually log base 2 of 26 = 4.7 bits of info per letter
[01/31/2009 08:56:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think
[01/31/2009 08:56:12 PM] bjcullinan: so there are 256 standard characters defined by ASCII, so every letter takes 1 byte
[01/31/2009 08:56:36 PM] bjcullinan: there are other things that can be defined in a byte like numbers
[01/31/2009 08:56:43 PM] bjcullinan: you are talking about bit compression
[01/31/2009 08:57:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: human dna hold one exabyte of info (10^18) where tera is 10^12
[01/31/2009 08:57:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: cool huh
[01/31/2009 08:57:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[01/31/2009 08:57:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was just talking about the 26 letters in the alphabet
[01/31/2009 08:58:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: 256 characters yes, 1 byte
[01/31/2009 08:58:26 PM] bjcullinan: that is actually a pretty advanced compression scheme, you define how many different characters there are, then you can bit smash all the information
[01/31/2009 08:58:39 PM] bjcullinan: and tera is a multiple of 2 not 10
[01/31/2009 08:58:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[01/31/2009 08:58:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like you can only compres so much
[01/31/2009 08:58:52 PM] bjcullinan: correct
[01/31/2009 08:59:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry 10^12 bytes
[01/31/2009 09:01:22 PM] bjcullinan: a terabyte is 2^40
[01/31/2009 09:01:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: yo mama so fat, her waste size is 2^40 bits
[01/31/2009 09:02:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: waist
[01/31/2009 09:02:15 PM] bjcullinan: your mama so fat you can't spell
[01/31/2009 09:02:16 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[01/31/2009 09:02:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: lol
[01/31/2009 09:02:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i meant the stuff that comes out of her butt
[01/31/2009 09:03:20 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[01/31/2009 09:03:23 PM] bjcullinan: haha
[01/31/2009 09:03:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: no i didnt
[01/31/2009 09:03:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i changed it so i didnt misspell
[01/31/2009 09:03:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think its cool to do homework here in Cesar's lab
[01/31/2009 09:04:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: he's got five computers running matlab code
[01/31/2009 09:05:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: it kinda reminds me of protein folding, how everything is doing different things (there is an x y z chart with a bunch of red dots)
[01/31/2009 09:05:20 PM] bjcullinan: your matlab code?
[01/31/2009 09:24:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: love,do you have aim
[01/31/2009 09:24:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: michael brooks wants to kno'w
[01/31/2009 09:25:03 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[01/31/2009 09:25:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: is?
[01/31/2009 09:25:08 PM] bjcullinan: give him my screen name
[01/31/2009 09:25:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: can i tell him/
[01/31/2009 09:25:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: what is it?
[01/31/2009 09:25:27 PM] bjcullinan: bjcullinan
[01/31/2009 09:25:32 PM] bjcullinan: i thought you used trillian
[01/31/2009 09:25:37 PM] bjcullinan: you should have all of mees
[01/31/2009 09:25:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have your yahoo msn and google
[01/31/2009 09:26:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: actually, i neer use my aim
[01/31/2009 09:26:18 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[01/31/2009 09:26:24 PM] bjcullinan: well my aim is bjcullinan
[01/31/2009 09:26:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: no wait
[01/31/2009 09:26:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i do
[01/31/2009 09:27:48 PM] bjcullinan: is he going to IM me?
[01/31/2009 09:30:31 PM] bjcullinan: what is his screen name?
[01/31/2009 09:31:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: FireAlwaysWorks
[01/31/2009 09:31:45 PM] bjcullinan: do you talk to him a lot?
[01/31/2009 09:31:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[01/31/2009 09:32:11 PM] bjcullinan: he's pretty cool
[01/31/2009 09:32:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah he is a swell kinda guy
[01/31/2009 09:41:21 PM] bjcullinan: how did you know he wan'ts my screen name?
[01/31/2009 09:41:27 PM] *** Auto-response from Crystal Diaz: I am currently idle.
[01/31/2009 09:47:15 PM] bjcullinan: i'm going skiing tomorrow morning
[01/31/2009 09:47:20 PM] *** Auto-response from Crystal Diaz: I am currently away from the computer.
[01/31/2009 09:47:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: lucky
[01/31/2009 09:47:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: he asked me for it
[01/31/2009 09:47:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: I am not sure what i have told you becaus we havent talked much
[01/31/2009 09:48:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i turned down skiing that i suggested in the first place to go to a chi alpha retreat, i told you all this?
[01/31/2009 09:48:42 PM] bjcullinan: no, you didn't tell me
[01/31/2009 09:49:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: tis truE!
[01/31/2009 09:49:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: i may have been a tiny bit guilted into it
[01/31/2009 09:49:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz tracy was holding her very little baby when she asked me why i didnt want to come
[01/31/2009 09:50:33 PM] bjcullinan: you could have just said you were already invited to go skiing with some other friends
[01/31/2009 09:51:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: I could have
[01/31/2009 09:51:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: but I couldnt say that to Tracy!
[01/31/2009 09:52:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: I talk to Tracy about God and stuff
[01/31/2009 09:52:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: and that is a petty reason to not go to a God retreat
[01/31/2009 09:55:24 PM] bjcullinan: you have to do it because you want to, not because you feel bad for not going
[01/31/2009 09:56:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: i said tiny bit
[01/31/2009 09:56:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: im gonna have fun
[01/31/2009 09:57:35 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[01/31/2009 09:57:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[01/31/2009 09:57:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you afraid
[01/31/2009 09:58:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: for us
[01/31/2009 09:58:13 PM] bjcullinan: always
[01/31/2009 10:01:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry love
[01/31/2009 10:01:37 PM] bjcullinan: i wish all i had to do was hold a small child and talk to you in order to get you to change your mind
[01/31/2009 10:02:04 PM] bjcullinan: don't you see how easily manipulated you are?
[01/31/2009 10:02:33 PM] bjcullinan: you helped plan this other trip to make it happen, and you changed your mind from 1 discussion?
[01/31/2009 10:03:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: the search for god is more important than skiing
[01/31/2009 10:04:33 PM] bjcullinan: i agree
[01/31/2009 10:06:07 PM] bjcullinan: it just seems like when you have to make a decision by yourself you spend so much time worrying about if it is the right thing to do, but then when you let other people tell you what to do, the decision is quick and easy
[01/31/2009 10:07:25 PM] bjcullinan: for example when you were trying to decide to go skiing you called me and told me about all the benefits of hanging out with other friends and spending less money, not someone tells you that you should go on the retreat and you change your mind again
[01/31/2009 10:08:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i've gotten this far, haven't i?
[01/31/2009 10:12:35 PM] bjcullinan: in life?
[01/31/2009 10:12:40 PM] bjcullinan: that makes it better?
[01/31/2009 10:17:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[01/31/2009 10:19:52 PM] bjcullinan: i think that is very immature
[01/31/2009 10:20:27 PM] bjcullinan: i don't have a problem with either decision, go on the retreat, go skiing, do both
[01/31/2009 10:20:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: WHY DONT YOU LIKE ME?
[01/31/2009 10:20:58 PM] bjcullinan: but your inability to think freely from other people's opinion, is kind of ridiculous
[01/31/2009 10:22:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: you judge me too much, where is the loveS?
[01/31/2009 10:23:18 PM] bjcullinan: i don't judge anyone, i observe their behavior
[01/31/2009 10:25:01 PM] bjcullinan: i do love you
[01/31/2009 10:25:09 PM] bjcullinan: i just want to see you grow
[01/31/2009 10:25:20 PM] bjcullinan: be more independent
[01/31/2009 10:25:36 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want you to get hurt
[01/31/2009 10:25:51 PM] bjcullinan: i think we have made a lot of progress in our relationship
[01/31/2009 10:26:21 PM] bjcullinan: and i know we have our problems, but there are dozens of reasons why i want to be with you
[01/31/2009 10:33:19 PM] bjcullinan: anything?
[01/31/2009 10:34:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: i hope things get better
[01/31/2009 10:34:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: looking into the future... i want us to better if we are to stay together.
[01/31/2009 10:34:52 PM] bjcullinan: it won't get better on it's own, we have to work on our relationship together
[01/31/2009 10:39:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: lemme just work on the god thing for a hwile
[01/31/2009 10:39:55 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[01/31/2009 10:40:51 PM] bjcullinan: what do you want me to do in the meantime?
[01/31/2009 10:42:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: talk to me!!!!!!!
[01/31/2009 10:42:46 PM] bjcullinan: i am!
[01/31/2009 10:43:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean generally
[01/31/2009 10:44:46 PM] bjcullinan: i know what you meant :-D
[01/31/2009 10:46:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: hi
[01/31/2009 10:46:58 PM] bjcullinan: hi
[01/31/2009 10:47:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: its weird how i can talk to you on my laptop and it will only show up on my laptop and i can talk to you on my remote desktop and it will only show up on my remote desktop, but it is all the same service
[01/31/2009 10:48:26 PM] bjcullinan: what do you mean? you have trillian open in both places?
[01/31/2009 10:49:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: no i have google talk on my laptop, trillian on my desktop AND google mail open, but even on google mail when i talk to you on google talk it wont show up in mail
[01/31/2009 10:50:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: but when i talk to you on goggle mail?
[01/31/2009 10:50:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: im taing about the things you say back, where they show up
[01/31/2009 10:50:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: talking

[01/31/2009 10:51:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes thats right!!!1
[01/31/2009 10:51:39 PM] bjcullinan: so depending on where you talk to me I always respond in the right window?
[01/31/2009 10:51:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: it didnt show up on google talk!

[01/31/2009 11:12:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i don think i got your transfer request
[01/31/2009 11:14:20 PM] bjcullinan: you have to make sure windows file sharing is on in order to copy a file from your desktop to your laptop
[01/31/2009 11:14:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm

[02/05/2009 11:55:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: i couldnt find it

[02/05/2009 11:57:29 PM] bjcullinan: but we are not there anymore
[02/05/2009 11:58:19 PM] bjcullinan: so the sex isn't a big deal to me
[02/05/2009 11:58:28 PM] bjcullinan: it is the physical contact that makes it a big deal
[02/05/2009 11:58:52 PM] bjcullinan: and when we don't have sex, we don't connect physically or intimately
[02/05/2009 11:58:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[02/05/2009 11:59:13 PM] bjcullinan: i mean you don't even want to cuddle after sex, how would there be cuddling without sex?
[02/05/2009 11:59:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i jump to the idea that when we are physical without sex we are soon gonna be having sex
[02/05/2009 11:59:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: i want to cuddle!
[02/05/2009 11:59:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just need more assurance
[02/05/2009 11:59:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: less expectation
[02/05/2009 11:59:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: and that's my fault, i think it's kinda cuz of my path
[02/05/2009 11:59:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: lots of expectation
[02/06/2009 12:00:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: hard to break
[02/06/2009 12:00:32 AM] bjcullinan: and i guess that if it bothers you to think about it when you are searching for God, then my justification for sex isn't enough for you

[02/08/2009 06:26:03 PM] Crystal Diaz:     * Describe a time when you encountered serious obstacles to success while working on a project. You may choose any academic, professional, or extracurricular project you have worked on during the past four years. 
     * Your essay should address all of the following questions: 
           o What was the aim of the project? 
           o What were the specific obstacles that arose, and why did they occur? 
           o How specifically did you respond to those obstacles? What specific actions did you take? You may describe more than one approach, if relevant. 
           o What was the ultimate outcome with respect to the initial aim of the project? Why did this outcome occur? 
 
 While you should completely describe the obstacle(s) you faced, please do not focus your essay primarily on the obstacle(s); it is more important that you thoroughly explain your reaction and describe the steps you took in response to the obstacle(s). The experience you choose to describe may relate to any academic, professional, or extracurricular project.t?

[02/11/2009 12:11:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: i hate when you imply that i make you think you are never enough
[02/11/2009 12:11:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: ... I just think helping me is nice
[02/11/2009 12:41:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: I wish you were with me damnit
[02/11/2009 12:41:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: I dont really really blame you
[02/11/2009 12:41:36 AM] Crystal Diaz: I am well aware that nothing like this is your fault
[02/11/2009 12:41:43 AM] Crystal Diaz: I never forget that
[02/11/2009 12:42:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: i am sad that i am not stronger and more independent for you
[02/11/2009 12:44:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like that I feel like i might be better without you. better meaning more independent when it comes to waking up (i only have myself to blame) and more studious, more able to look at life without you in the equation (which i guess isn't acttally "better" but, makes more sense in a feminist sort of way)...
[02/11/2009 12:45:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: more independent when it comes to picking clothes and taking showers and buying/making food and taking shits
[02/11/2009 12:45:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: plunging my own plugged up toilets.

[02/11/2009 01:15:27 AM] bjcullinan: maybe if you went to bed at the right time every night you would be able to get up easier in the morning
[02/11/2009 01:15:48 AM] Crystal Diaz: I decdied since i got up so late, i should stay up late, but anytime i stay up late, i get up late, so now i am going to stay up until tomorrow and go to bed at a good time like 11

[02/11/2009 01:19:26 AM] bjcullinan: but i just don't feel tired enough because our stupid neighbors were stomping around at like 11 after the sleep enzymes were already released in my body
[02/11/2009 01:19:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: aw, drink chamomile
[02/11/2009 01:19:51 AM] bjcullinan: and hearing them worked up adrenaline to neutralize it, so now i am all out of enzymes

[02/11/2009 01:21:06 AM] bjcullinan: of the mind
[02/11/2009 01:21:22 AM] bjcullinan: reading a book relaxes the mind
[02/11/2009 01:21:29 AM] bjcullinan: tv is not a good way to wind down
[02/11/2009 01:22:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: that makes sense, but you are talking to the girl who gets tired when she drinks coffee, i think its personal too

[02/18/2009 01:20:02 PM] bjcullinan: but he expresses his opinions to us, he said all women are worthless whores
[02/18/2009 01:20:25 PM] bjcullinan: and i thought it was pretty strong opinions coming from someone who has never been a relationship with a woman
[02/18/2009 01:20:41 PM] bjcullinan: but it's ok because we will never get any, and that way he can't reproduce
[02/18/2009 01:21:05 PM] bjcullinan: sometimes if we are feeling really juvenile we call him master bater

[02/24/2009 08:24:25 AM] bjcullinan: my notes say T(x) = Ax, A = standard matrix of T
[02/24/2009 08:24:29 AM] Crystal Diaz: or maybe someone that looks nicxe in class that you havent asled before
[02/24/2009 08:24:36 AM] bjcullinan: A = T[e1e2e3]
[02/24/2009 08:24:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: hnn
[02/24/2009 08:24:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[02/24/2009 08:25:11 AM] bjcullinan: a = [[2 1 -4],[-4 2 -1],[0 4 -4]]
[02/24/2009 08:26:03 AM] bjcullinan: so does that mean i combine the 3 columns and multiple it by [0 -3 2]?
[02/24/2009 08:26:34 AM] Crystal Diaz: how do you get 2 1 -4 04 3 01 0 4 0 -4?
[02/24/2009 08:26:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: uh you know what i mean
[02/24/2009 08:26:56 AM] bjcullinan: from combining the 3 columns
[02/24/2009 08:27:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont see that
[02/24/2009 08:27:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: i see -4 -3 -3   -3 1 4    2 -3 4
[02/24/2009 08:27:40 AM] bjcullinan: sorry this is from the example problem you are right
[02/24/2009 08:27:56 AM] bjcullinan: *or the one he did in class with different numbers
[02/24/2009 08:28:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: man
[02/24/2009 08:28:25 AM] Crystal Diaz: so do you have the answer to the one he did in class?

[02/24/2009 08:30:07 AM] bjcullinan: can do problem 5 either!
[02/24/2009 08:31:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: ok do -2*(-4,-3,-3) + -1*(-3,1,4) + 3*(2,-3,4)
[02/24/2009 08:31:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: now!
[02/24/2009 08:31:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: so enter

[02/24/2009 08:33:58 AM] bjcullinan: it's right
[02/24/2009 08:34:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: 17,-4,14!!!!!!!!!!!
[02/24/2009 08:34:02 AM] bjcullinan: how did you get it?
[02/24/2009 08:34:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[02/24/2009 08:34:35 AM] Crystal Diaz: well can you see where i got the numbeRS?
[02/24/2009 08:34:43 AM] bjcullinan: no
[02/24/2009 08:35:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: they give you te1 te2 te3
[02/24/2009 08:35:20 AM] bjcullinan: ya
[02/24/2009 08:35:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: so....
[02/24/2009 08:35:59 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dunno you do -2*te1 + -1*te2 + 3*te
[02/24/2009 08:36:01 AM] Crystal Diaz: 3
[02/24/2009 08:36:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: cuz t(-2, -1, 3) is what they ask for

[02/24/2009 08:36:45 AM] bjcullinan: yeah
[02/24/2009 08:37:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: go down to buliding linear transformations at the bottom
[02/24/2009 08:37:17 AM] Crystal Diaz: at the bottom of buliding linear transformations
[02/24/2009 08:40:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: did i ever give you this 
[02/24/2009 08:40:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: (Link: http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~ns46/linalg.pdf)http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~ns46/linalg.pdf
[02/24/2009 08:40:39 AM] bjcullinan: got it!
[02/24/2009 08:40:55 AM] bjcullinan: now do 2 and 5
[02/24/2009 08:41:10 AM] Crystal Diaz: it might be hard to understand. damnit brian if we were together, then we could study together and i wouldnt have spent the last 50 hrs in bed
[02/24/2009 08:41:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: me?
[02/24/2009 08:41:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: you do it!
[02/24/2009 08:41:16 AM] bjcullinan: 5 should be easy but i can't figure out the right combination i must be missing some stupid rule
[02/24/2009 08:41:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: i cant see it
[02/24/2009 08:43:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: i got 5
[02/24/2009 08:43:30 AM] bjcullinan: what is it!?
[02/24/2009 08:44:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: only forms  like y=cx is a transformation cuz it needs to satisfy additivity and multiplicative
[02/24/2009 08:44:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: knock me out of webwork and look
[02/24/2009 08:44:49 AM] bjcullinan: so B?
[02/24/2009 08:44:58 AM] bjcullinan: and thats all?
[02/24/2009 08:45:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: no abf
[02/24/2009 08:45:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: it can be y = cx1+dx2+ex3
[02/24/2009 08:45:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: it just can never be y=xx
[02/24/2009 08:45:33 AM] Crystal Diaz: thats not linear
[02/24/2009 08:45:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: or y=x+8
[02/24/2009 08:45:46 AM] bjcullinan: yeah thats what i thought they were just hard to understand because they are all close together
[02/24/2009 08:45:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: or y=8
[02/24/2009 08:46:00 AM] bjcullinan: nap time!
[02/24/2009 08:46:00 AM] Crystal Diaz: ha yeah
[02/24/2009 08:46:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: no!
[02/24/2009 08:46:05 AM] Crystal Diaz: you have class!
[02/24/2009 08:46:11 AM] bjcullinan: not yet!
[02/24/2009 08:46:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: study!
[02/24/2009 08:46:22 AM] Crystal Diaz: you dont even undersrand!
[02/24/2009 08:46:30 AM] bjcullinan: i do!
[02/24/2009 08:47:16 AM] Crystal Diaz: can you do 2???
[02/24/2009 08:47:47 AM] bjcullinan: yeah it just takes too long
[02/24/2009 08:48:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: you might have to on the test!
[02/24/2009 08:48:18 AM] bjcullinan: then i'll save it for last
[02/24/2009 08:48:26 AM] bjcullinan: and he said we will have small numbers
[02/24/2009 08:48:34 AM] bjcullinan: not retartedly large numbers like on webwork
[02/24/2009 08:49:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: 2 is bf!
[02/24/2009 08:49:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: can you quickly se why tho
[02/24/2009 08:50:31 AM] Crystal Diaz: i think since a is a 2x3 it cant be linearliy independent, and c is practically a 2x3 cuz of the 0s
[02/24/2009 08:51:21 AM] Crystal Diaz: b is clearly linearly independent cuz its not 1,2 6,12, e should be clearly not, d should be clearly not, f is not so clear so i guessed that is is linearly indepepndentlj
[02/24/2009 08:52:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: OMG brian!
[02/24/2009 08:52:13 AM] Crystal Diaz: your grade on set 1.. dont do that anymoe

[02/24/2009 09:26:45 PM] bjcullinan: just because you feel bad doesn't mean you have to make everyone around you feel bad
[02/24/2009 09:27:15 PM] bjcullinan: why do you feel like you have to say mean things to me?
[02/24/2009 09:27:24 PM] bjcullinan: is it to make it interesting?
[02/24/2009 09:27:55 PM] bjcullinan: is it because you don't want to be with me?
[02/24/2009 09:28:04 PM] bjcullinan: do i really make you sad?
[02/24/2009 09:28:49 PM] bjcullinan: if i make you sad then you should break up with me
[02/24/2009 09:28:59 PM] bjcullinan: because i don't want to make you sad
[02/24/2009 09:31:00 PM] bjcullinan: i think we should break up
[02/24/2009 09:35:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: hi
[02/24/2009 09:35:52 PM] bjcullinan: it's obvious that we don't have the capacity to love each other from across the country
[02/24/2009 09:37:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: baby
[02/24/2009 09:37:30 PM] bjcullinan: yeah?
[02/24/2009 09:39:42 PM] bjcullinan: we have these outstanding expectations of each other
[02/24/2009 09:39:51 PM] bjcullinan: it isn't healthy
[02/24/2009 09:40:36 PM] bjcullinan: we are holding each other back
[02/24/2009 09:46:37 PM] bjcullinan: i think the worst part is knowing that you are going to turn to all the same people instead of coming to me when you needed help
[02/24/2009 09:51:15 PM] bjcullinan: i can't stand looking at the IM window waiting for a response

[02/25/2009 10:50:58 AM] bjcullinan: i don't really like it when people exaggerate about that kind of stuff, it is really high schoolish, same with the killing yourself thing, so i am just going to not talk about it anymore

[02/25/2009 10:51:14 AM] Crystal Diaz: dump me then
[02/25/2009 10:51:32 AM] bjcullinan: you are really pushing, i am starting to think that is what you want
[02/25/2009 10:53:54 AM] Crystal Diaz: no
[02/25/2009 10:54:37 AM] bjcullinan: it's stuff like this that makes me not want to talk to you

[02/25/2009 10:55:08 AM] Crystal Diaz: to my feelings
[02/25/2009 10:55:19 AM] bjcullinan: you wonder why i don't make our conversations a priority it is because when i finally start to, you go off and make some big deal about stupid little stuff, and you talk about some guy "hating" you
[02/25/2009 10:55:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: he does
[02/25/2009 10:55:36 AM] bjcullinan: that's bullshit
[02/25/2009 10:55:41 AM] Crystal Diaz: baby cmon i dont understand what to do
[02/25/2009 10:55:53 AM] Crystal Diaz: how can i be with you if you dont have uh
[02/25/2009 10:55:55 AM] bjcullinan: that's not the point anyways
[02/25/2009 10:55:56 AM] Crystal Diaz: tolerance
[02/25/2009 10:56:13 AM] bjcullinan: whenever i make an effort to be close to you, to push me away with things like "so dump me then"
[02/25/2009 10:56:32 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want you to be unhappy
[02/25/2009 10:56:34 AM] bjcullinan: and whenever i am considering it, you get upset and decide you want to be with me, or you were wrong to think those things
[02/25/2009 10:56:40 AM] bjcullinan: make up your mind already!
[02/25/2009 10:56:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: i say that aftrer you say something that makes it clear that you have a hard time being with me
[02/25/2009 10:57:23 AM] Crystal Diaz: i want to be with you, it's just
[02/25/2009 10:57:30 AM] Crystal Diaz: im trying to get through this cornell program
[02/25/2009 10:57:43 AM] bjcullinan: not wanting to hear about some guy hating on you doesn't mean it is a hard time for me, i just want you to figure it out so we can talk about something different
[02/25/2009 10:57:51 AM] Crystal Diaz: and i know i exxagerate, but i really feel these feelings
[02/25/2009 10:57:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: like he hates me
[02/25/2009 10:57:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: i feel it and it hurts
[02/25/2009 10:58:07 AM] Crystal Diaz: and it seems like you belittle my feelings
[02/25/2009 10:58:08 AM] bjcullinan: what indication does he give you that he hates you?
[02/25/2009 10:58:24 AM] Crystal Diaz: the way he shakes his head and makes me cry
[02/25/2009 10:58:42 AM] Crystal Diaz: the way he said "have you started it
[02/25/2009 10:58:47 AM] Crystal Diaz: then i cant talk to you about it"
[02/25/2009 10:59:03 AM] Crystal Diaz: and the way i feel bad when i feel like i havent contributed anything to the work
[02/25/2009 10:59:15 AM] bjcullinan: hes just being snotty
[02/25/2009 10:59:15 AM] Crystal Diaz: your girlfriend is SAD
[02/25/2009 10:59:20 AM] bjcullinan: some people are like that
[02/25/2009 10:59:26 AM] bjcullinan: it doesn't mean he hates you
[02/25/2009 10:59:39 AM] bjcullinan: that's exaggerating 
[02/25/2009 10:59:49 AM] Crystal Diaz: but i feel it
[02/25/2009 11:01:18 AM] bjcullinan: then you have convinced yourself that he hates when he is really just being stuck up
[02/25/2009 11:01:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: hes not a bad guy, he's hard working, andyway i dont want to talk about that
[02/25/2009 11:08:18 AM] Crystal Diaz: all alone

[02/25/2009 11:05:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: i bet you can do my spreadsheet assignment in less than 30 minutes
[02/25/2009 11:05:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: its all coding
[02/25/2009 11:05:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: its VB but still, its pretty much something you are good at
[02/25/2009 11:06:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: I can do excel coding :P
[02/25/2009 11:07:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know what is efficient though!!
[02/25/2009 11:07:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats why i am having trouble
[02/25/2009 11:43:46 PM] bjcullinan: if making it efficient isn't apart of the assignment then you shouldn't worry about it
[02/25/2009 11:43:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[02/25/2009 11:44:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: ill ask about
[02/25/2009 11:44:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: it
[02/25/2009 11:44:09 PM] bjcullinan: VB is a very high level language, so casting stuff more then once or checking things multiple times it ok
[02/25/2009 11:44:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: right now im just doing what i think makes most logical sense in a how-would-a-human do it way
[02/25/2009 11:45:19 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, excel runs at 30 frames per second, it is pretty quick
[02/25/2009 11:45:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: ooh

[03/01/2009 02:01:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[03/01/2009 02:07:47 PM] bjcullinan: obviously you don't understand.  I am religious, more so then you, and my views aren't wrong just because they are different from your Pentecostal friends.  I am apart of the majority here, i have never even heard of pentacostal until you started talking about them.  I don't think what they believe and how the practice is right or normal.
[03/01/2009 02:08:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: im tyring to be more like you
[03/01/2009 02:10:47 PM] bjcullinan: i prayed to god last night that he would help me find the one i am supposed to be with forever.  Now i'm completely lost because last week i thought that person was you and not.  I feel like my world is falling apart.
[03/01/2009 02:13:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: youthought i was the one
[03/01/2009 02:13:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i could be
[03/01/2009 02:13:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe god will answer your prayers
[03/01/2009 02:16:39 PM] bjcullinan: or maybe that's something we have to be responsible for

[03/01/2009 02:17:26 PM] bjcullinan: maybe it is just an outline though, and we are supposed to write the story ourselves

[03/01/2009 11:16:31 PM] bjcullinan: i believe what i want to believe, and i believe in the bible, but i don't believe the gifts of the holy spirit, the basis for the entire religion, is the most significant thing about god

[03/08/2009 03:55:39 PM] bjcullinan: it just depends on what you want, if you want to be with me, then be with me and no one else, that includes not getting immature crushes on other guys
[03/08/2009 03:55:51 PM] bjcullinan: when i am with you, i don't even see other women
[03/08/2009 03:55:57 PM] bjcullinan: i am blinded by love
[03/08/2009 03:56:02 PM] bjcullinan: obviously you are not
[03/08/2009 03:56:22 PM] bjcullinan: if you dont want to be with me, then don't expect me to respond to you physically
[03/08/2009 03:56:33 PM] bjcullinan: don't expect me to pick up your calls and talk to you every day
[03/08/2009 03:56:49 PM] bjcullinan: don't expect me to not see other women and try and get into another relationship
[03/08/2009 03:57:41 PM] bjcullinan: it's up to you, you can have me, or you can't, there is no in between, but i expect you to commit yourself to our relationship if you want to be with me
[03/08/2009 03:57:48 PM] bjcullinan: is it ceasar?
[03/08/2009 03:57:52 PM] bjcullinan: is he the other guy?
[03/08/2009 03:57:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[03/08/2009 03:58:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: its
[03/08/2009 03:58:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: just
[03/08/2009 03:58:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[03/08/2009 03:58:12 PM] bjcullinan: who is it?
[03/08/2009 03:58:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know what i want
[03/08/2009 03:58:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i do know but i cant 
[03/08/2009 03:58:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont expect you to wait
[03/08/2009 03:58:52 PM] bjcullinan: commitment means not saying lovey things to other people
[03/08/2009 03:59:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont expect any of that
[03/08/2009 04:23:32 PM] bjcullinan: what i meant by that was, not ending email with xoxox or saying "goodbye love" to people you aren't in a relationship with
[03/08/2009 04:23:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i understand
[03/08/2009 04:23:41 PM] bjcullinan: thats what you were doing before
[03/08/2009 04:23:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i stopped
[03/08/2009 04:24:01 PM] bjcullinan: do you honestly think that he will be able to give you what you need?
[03/08/2009 04:24:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe.
[03/08/2009 04:24:25 PM] bjcullinan: do you think he is like your doorway to god
[03/08/2009 04:24:27 PM] bjcullinan: ?
[03/08/2009 04:24:42 PM] bjcullinan: do you think that "maybe" is worth destroying a wonderful relationship?
[03/08/2009 04:24:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe he is
[03/08/2009 04:25:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: not really
[03/08/2009 04:25:14 PM] bjcullinan: i was so hopeful for us earlier, we had such a great talk, and i was really looking forward to seeing you
[03/08/2009 04:25:23 PM] bjcullinan: then why did you!?
[03/08/2009 04:25:40 PM] bjcullinan: if maybe isn't worth destroying us then why did you!?
[03/08/2009 04:26:10 PM] bjcullinan: i got my hopes up, and it was foolish of me.
[03/08/2009 04:26:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: I don't think I can talk about it
[03/08/2009 04:26:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not good at this
[03/08/2009 04:26:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry
[03/08/2009 04:29:08 PM] bjcullinan: you will never find a guy that can give you what you need, because you can't be happy with one guy, i thought that if we went to mexico it would be like love at first sight again, but that can't happen, i don't think it would be a good idea for you to go with me because i am not comfortable sharing a bed with you.  i am done with this roller-coaster ride, please try not to contact me as much.
[03/08/2009 04:30:00 PM] bjcullinan: good luck with your future relationships, you will need it.
[03/08/2009 04:33:20 PM] bjcullinan: i will miss the great times we had
[03/08/2009 04:34:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: but what if i decide you
[03/08/2009 04:35:27 PM] bjcullinan: well, now you don't have to make a decision
[03/08/2009 04:35:53 PM] bjcullinan: and you can make other decisions just like you always have, and that is without me
[03/08/2009 04:36:09 PM] bjcullinan: and you can decide to break other guys hearts
[03/08/2009 04:36:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry brian
[03/08/2009 04:36:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thinki want you though!
[03/08/2009 04:36:26 PM] bjcullinan: no crystal
[03/08/2009 04:36:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just need time!
[03/08/2009 04:36:29 PM] bjcullinan: i'm sorry for you
[03/08/2009 04:36:38 PM] bjcullinan: time can't fix it
[03/08/2009 04:36:49 PM] bjcullinan: a psychologist might be able to help though
[03/08/2009 04:36:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: but we were so close
[03/08/2009 04:37:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: to getting back together
[03/08/2009 04:37:36 PM] bjcullinan: were being the keyword
[03/08/2009 04:38:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if i come with you anyway!
[03/08/2009 04:38:03 PM] bjcullinan: but you can't make up your mind about anything, and i can't even stand the thought of MAYBE being loved
[03/08/2009 04:38:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if it is love at first sight!
[03/08/2009 04:38:12 PM] bjcullinan: good luck getting a ride
[03/08/2009 04:38:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok fine
[03/08/2009 04:38:44 PM] bjcullinan: accept it
[03/08/2009 04:38:53 PM] bjcullinan: you lost me because of some stupid school girl crush
[03/08/2009 04:39:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: its stupid
[03/08/2009 04:39:55 PM] bjcullinan: think about that when you are waiting alone in the airport friday night
[03/08/2009 04:41:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: you wouldnt pick me up if i asked?
[03/08/2009 04:43:07 PM] bjcullinan: i would if we were friends
[03/08/2009 04:43:11 PM] bjcullinan: but you really hurt me
[03/08/2009 04:43:18 PM] bjcullinan: and friends don't do that
[03/08/2009 04:43:30 PM] bjcullinan: i need to be out of your life

[03/08/2009 04:56:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: it doesnt have to be like this
[03/08/2009 04:57:40 PM] bjcullinan: it doesn't, but you haven't given me any other option
[03/08/2009 04:59:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: its hard for me to believe you are serious
[03/08/2009 04:59:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if its just the distance!

[03/08/2009 05:02:36 PM] bjcullinan: how is the distance any different from liking Luke? you gave up on us multiple times because of a MAYBE
[03/08/2009 05:03:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: i really dont think i can be like my friends
[03/08/2009 05:05:09 PM] bjcullinan: how does that have to do with you still having a crush on Luke?
[03/08/2009 05:06:07 PM] bjcullinan: i guess i can't help asking, what does he have that i don't?
[03/08/2009 05:06:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not a crush
[03/08/2009 05:06:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes we were doing fine
[03/08/2009 05:06:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: but then he said something, and it made me falter a little, but its just temporary
[03/08/2009 05:06:39 PM] bjcullinan: what did he say?
[03/08/2009 05:06:46 PM] bjcullinan: today?

[03/08/2009 05:07:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: its already done enough damage
[03/08/2009 05:07:05 PM] bjcullinan: i think you should tell me
[03/08/2009 05:07:22 PM] bjcullinan: you owe it to me
[03/08/2009 05:07:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[03/08/2009 05:07:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: he said that he is attracted to me
[03/08/2009 05:07:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i told him that guys like him are suppsoed to be with girls like anna and girls like me are supposed to be with guys like YOU
[03/08/2009 05:08:20 PM] bjcullinan: and when he was here, and when we were doing fine, he liked anna, so what does that tel you?
[03/08/2009 05:08:37 PM] bjcullinan: what the fuck?
[03/08/2009 05:08:42 PM] bjcullinan: he doesn't even know me
[03/08/2009 05:08:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: i told him
[03/08/2009 05:08:56 PM] bjcullinan: and he doesn't know what you are throwing away with stupid shit like that

[03/08/2009 05:10:13 PM] bjcullinan: so what?  are you going to move to north carolina, and live with him, and praise god together?
[03/08/2009 05:10:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: no because that is not me
[03/08/2009 05:10:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: it just messed with my head
[03/08/2009 05:11:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: it took me a little while to get over that thing with him last semester, so i just need a day
[03/08/2009 05:11:31 PM] bjcullinan: Keifer's last girlfriend did the same thing, she found a pentacostal guy, cheated on him, joined the church, they had sex and she became a slut, he life went down hill
[03/08/2009 05:11:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: that sucks for her!
[03/08/2009 05:11:52 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[03/08/2009 05:12:14 PM] bjcullinan: he felt horrible too, like maybe if he kept her close her life wouldn't have gotten screwed up
[03/08/2009 05:12:23 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to see that hurt happen to you
[03/08/2009 05:13:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: well

[03/08/2009 05:16:55 PM] bjcullinan: if it's your tendency to like other guys, should i accept you for who you are, including that?
[03/08/2009 05:17:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: maybe i can fix that with time
[03/08/2009 05:17:24 PM] bjcullinan: do i be as sweet as i usually am in hopes you will fall in love with me again?
[03/08/2009 05:17:44 PM] bjcullinan: or do i be mean so you will leave me alone and i can stop crying over you?
[03/08/2009 05:18:08 PM] bjcullinan: i don't want to be like your last boyfriend
[03/08/2009 05:18:24 PM] bjcullinan: but i don't want to give up on us because of distance
[03/08/2009 05:18:59 PM] bjcullinan: everyone said it hard, and it ends, but they never made it until it wasn't long distance anymore
[03/08/2009 05:19:24 PM] bjcullinan: you're the only one i can come to for advice that i trust
[03/08/2009 05:19:32 PM] bjcullinan: so give me advice
[03/08/2009 05:19:46 PM] bjcullinan: i hurt waiting for you, and i hurt more without you

[03/08/2009 06:59:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im asking if its not just a thing where you are confessing how much you want me and love me just because times are tought, and so when i come back around, you wont want me as much, like you wont really mean what you say

[03/23/2009 09:15:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: and so it got me impatient
[03/23/2009 09:15:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: and it was creepy, you have to go through the woods to do stuff

[03/23/2009 09:16:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i got up, so i guess he just raped me and left me for dead
[03/23/2009 09:17:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: but i wasnt dead... and the house changes depending on what you do in the forest, but you cant guide yourself in the house (grandmas house) and thats it! and different girls have different "adventures" in the wood. my adventure was rape.

[03/24/2009 06:23:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: hara
[03/24/2009 06:23:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: I mean, i guess if they hadnt gone then the events wouldnt have happened that lead up to starbuck typing in the jump coordinates to earth
[03/24/2009 06:24:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i guess without hara, starbuck wouldnt have the realization of what the jump coordinates are
[03/24/2009 06:24:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: but
[03/24/2009 06:24:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: i thought hara meant more, but i guess not

[03/27/2009 12:38:10 AM] bjcullinan: that sentence didn't make sense, want to try again?
[03/27/2009 12:40:04 AM] Crystal Diaz: Suppose that when you do X Y or Z I feel some negative emotion. If we assume that you will continue to do X Y and Z at the current rate which you do them, I do not believe I will be able to change my perspective enought so that X Y and Z no longer affect me as negatively?
[03/27/2009 12:40:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: thats not a question, its a question of whether or noth you understood that statement
[03/27/2009 12:42:15 AM] bjcullinan: ya

[04/01/2009 01:32:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: fucking limit on DC++ was changed from 1GB to 100GB
[04/01/2009 01:32:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: what?
[04/01/2009 01:32:27 PM] bjcullinan: lol
[04/01/2009 01:32:45 PM] bjcullinan: i can help you make a sparse file to spoof your share size
[04/01/2009 01:32:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: hah really?
[04/01/2009 01:32:56 PM] bjcullinan: ya
[04/01/2009 01:33:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know why the person running that did that
[04/01/2009 01:33:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: okgo!
[04/01/2009 01:33:44 PM] bjcullinan: i will help you while i am at work
[04/01/2009 01:33:53 PM] bjcullinan: download cygwin
[04/01/2009 01:34:04 PM] bjcullinan: and go through default install
[04/01/2009 01:36:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: woah
[04/01/2009 01:36:34 PM] bjcullinan: what?
[04/01/2009 01:36:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: i have to do that?
[04/01/2009 01:36:58 PM] bjcullinan: there is a program that it comes with that creates sparse files
[04/01/2009 01:37:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if i dont have room for 100GB?
[04/01/2009 01:38:26 PM] bjcullinan: a sparse file is only 64K
[04/01/2009 01:38:32 PM] bjcullinan: that is the point
[04/01/2009 01:38:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: awesome!
[04/01/2009 01:38:50 PM] bjcullinan: it appears and reads as 100GB, but on disk it is only 64K
[04/01/2009 01:39:00 PM] bjcullinan: it's like when you go to the properties you can check archive
[04/01/2009 01:39:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok its doqwnloading
[04/01/2009 01:39:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: it sure is installing a lot of struff i dont need :(
[04/01/2009 01:40:10 PM] bjcullinan: it's just the base for it, it is pretty useful
[04/01/2009 01:40:23 PM] bjcullinan: it is basically linux commands ported to windows
[04/01/2009 01:40:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: i only used it as a CS major
[04/01/2009 01:40:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: huh ok
[04/01/2009 01:40:32 PM] bjcullinan: i guess you could use fsutil
[04/01/2009 01:40:37 PM] bjcullinan: g2g to work
[04/01/2009 01:40:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: ye
[04/01/2009 01:40:47 PM] bjcullinan: we will finish this conversation in a bit
[04/01/2009 02:09:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: brian
[04/01/2009 02:09:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: thinkinh
[04/01/2009 02:09:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: thinking of calling chair of math dept
[04/01/2009 02:09:57 PM] Crystal Diaz: but
[04/01/2009 02:10:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: what if i suck at math
[04/01/2009 02:10:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: liek i hit my peak
[04/01/2009 02:24:04 PM] bjcullinan: open the cygwin command line and use this command
 dd of=test bs=1k seek=128M count=1
[04/01/2009 02:25:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[04/01/2009 02:25:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: what was supposed to hapen
[04/01/2009 02:32:50 PM] bjcullinan: now go to C:\cygwin\home\<your name>
[04/01/2009 02:33:01 PM] bjcullinan: and you have a file test that is 128GB
[04/01/2009 02:33:19 PM] bjcullinan: put it somewhere and add the directory to DC++
[04/01/2009 02:33:26 PM] bjcullinan: it will take a while to hash it
[04/01/2009 02:33:35 PM] bjcullinan: so you have to leave it open until it is done
[04/01/2009 02:33:46 PM] bjcullinan: and then you can get on any DC++ network
[04/01/2009 02:34:10 PM] bjcullinan: i have created a petabyte sparse file before
[04/01/2009 02:35:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: im writing an email to janet mcshane
[04/01/2009 02:35:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: one more minute
[04/01/2009 02:36:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah!!! i sent it!
[04/01/2009 02:37:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: woah!
[04/01/2009 02:37:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: petabyte!
[04/01/2009 02:38:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: lame i tryied to move it to my shared folder, and it said i dont have enough space
[04/01/2009 02:39:36 PM] bjcullinan: hahahaha
[04/01/2009 02:39:41 PM] Crystal Diaz: :(
[04/01/2009 02:39:43 PM] bjcullinan: you probably just have to add another folder
[04/01/2009 02:39:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: add another folder?
[04/01/2009 02:39:53 PM] bjcullinan: or click try again and it actually will
[04/01/2009 02:40:02 PM] bjcullinan: add another folder to be shared in DC++
[04/01/2009 02:40:08 PM] bjcullinan: or does it only do one?
[04/01/2009 02:40:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can add another, you mean add the folder that contains the test?
[04/01/2009 02:40:50 PM] bjcullinan: cd /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and\ Settings/
[04/01/2009 02:40:52 PM] bjcullinan: yes
[04/01/2009 02:40:56 PM] bjcullinan: or do that
[04/01/2009 02:41:01 PM] bjcullinan: and go to your shared folder
[04/01/2009 02:41:10 PM] bjcullinan: and run the command again
[04/01/2009 02:41:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: uh... ill just add the folder in DC++
[04/01/2009 02:41:36 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/01/2009 02:42:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: blah i cant believe this

[04/01/2009 08:41:53 PM] bjcullinan: you can add it
[04/01/2009 08:42:35 PM] bjcullinan: A^-1 is the inverse right?
[04/01/2009 08:42:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/01/2009 08:46:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: i needa wash my face

[04/01/2009 08:54:04 PM] bjcullinan: need halp with problem 2
[04/01/2009 08:54:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: awesome!
[04/01/2009 08:54:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[04/01/2009 08:58:01 PM] bjcullinan: 1 0 0
 0 1 0
 0 0 1
[04/01/2009 09:07:56 PM] bjcullinan: you hung up on me
[04/01/2009 09:07:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: itse easier to explain on the phone
[04/01/2009 09:08:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry, you wanted to get off
[04/01/2009 09:08:11 PM] bjcullinan: it's harder for my to concentrate on the phone
[04/01/2009 09:08:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok, whatever you want
[04/01/2009 09:09:26 PM] bjcullinan: so row1 => row1 + (-4)*row2
[04/01/2009 09:09:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes and tehn + (-4)row3 to get rid of the other 4
[04/01/2009 09:10:53 PM] bjcullinan: it's not working
[04/01/2009 09:11:19 PM] bjcullinan: i put in 
 1 -4 -4
 0 1 7
 0 0 1
[04/01/2009 09:11:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you do the same to the identity?
[04/01/2009 09:12:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: you have to subtract four times the second row from the first, so in the identity side you will then have 1 -4 -32
[04/01/2009 09:12:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz you subtracted 4*7
[04/01/2009 09:12:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: then 4*1
[04/01/2009 09:13:13 PM] bjcullinan: i get it
[04/01/2009 09:14:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: cool
[04/01/2009 09:15:55 PM] bjcullinan: now i need help with 3 :-(
[04/01/2009 09:17:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[04/01/2009 09:19:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: what do you know
[04/01/2009 09:23:10 PM] bjcullinan: i guessed ADE
[04/01/2009 09:23:18 PM] bjcullinan: or ABDE
[04/01/2009 09:23:22 PM] bjcullinan: from what i know
[04/01/2009 09:23:27 PM] bjcullinan: but i must be missing something
[04/01/2009 09:23:55 PM] bjcullinan: oooooooh
[04/01/2009 09:24:07 PM] Crystal Diaz: well i dont remember the proof but i knwo that (ab)^(-1) = B-1 A-1 always
[04/01/2009 09:24:08 PM] bjcullinan: A*A^-1 = I
[04/01/2009 09:24:09 PM] bjcullinan: not 1
[04/01/2009 09:24:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: well 1 is kinda I in matrix world
[04/01/2009 09:24:47 PM] bjcullinan: but that doesn't mean it equals B
[04/01/2009 09:24:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: true
[04/01/2009 09:24:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: it has to be together
[04/01/2009 09:24:59 PM] bjcullinan: it would equal IB
[04/01/2009 09:25:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: ib = b
[04/01/2009 09:25:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: its not a*a-1*b
[04/01/2009 09:25:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: its a*b*a-1
[04/01/2009 09:25:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: which is different
[04/01/2009 09:25:27 PM] bjcullinan: IB = B?
[04/01/2009 09:25:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz you cant move around matrices like you can
[04/01/2009 09:25:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/01/2009 09:25:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: ib=b
[04/01/2009 09:25:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: bi=b
[04/01/2009 09:25:54 PM] bjcullinan: hmm
[04/01/2009 09:26:45 PM] bjcullinan: so definitely A and B
[04/01/2009 09:26:49 PM] bjcullinan: are true
[04/01/2009 09:27:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: no we just realized they are false
[04/01/2009 09:27:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: a*b*a-1 is not equal to a*a-1*b
[04/01/2009 09:27:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz you cant commute matrices
[04/01/2009 09:27:40 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[04/01/2009 09:27:54 PM] bjcullinan: then B is true because thats what you said above
[04/01/2009 09:28:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: no (ab)-1 = b-1a-1 
[04/01/2009 09:28:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: not a-1b-1
[04/01/2009 09:28:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: important
[04/01/2009 09:29:02 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/01/2009 09:29:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: butters reminds me off you
[04/01/2009 09:29:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: of you

[04/01/2009 09:39:54 PM] bjcullinan: so yes
[04/01/2009 10:06:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: good?
[04/01/2009 10:11:12 PM] bjcullinan: i don't know how to do 4
[04/01/2009 10:11:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: aw'
[04/01/2009 10:11:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[04/01/2009 10:11:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: well you can turn it into a system of equations
[04/01/2009 10:11:48 PM] bjcullinan: i want the right way
[04/01/2009 10:11:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: that is the right way?
[04/01/2009 10:12:01 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/01/2009 10:12:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: you have 4 equations, one for each entry
[04/01/2009 10:12:14 PM] bjcullinan: you don't do it with row operations?
[04/01/2009 10:12:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: so the first question is L11*U11 + L12*U21 = 4
[04/01/2009 10:13:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: the second is L11*U12 + L12*U22 = -3
[04/01/2009 10:13:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: the third is L21*U11 + L22*U21 = 12
[04/01/2009 10:13:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know if i have the 12 21 11 22s correct
[04/01/2009 10:13:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: but anyway
[04/01/2009 10:14:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: the 4th is L21*U12 + L22*U22 = -6
[04/01/2009 10:14:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: then you solve that knowing that L11 = L22 = 1
[04/01/2009 10:14:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: can you do that?
[04/01/2009 10:14:55 PM] bjcullinan: ya
[04/01/2009 10:20:27 PM] bjcullinan: so i have to make it echelon form first right?
[04/01/2009 10:20:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: know
[04/01/2009 10:20:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: no you do not i dont think
[04/01/2009 10:21:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh and L12=0 U21=0
[04/01/2009 10:23:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you have
[04/01/2009 10:24:44 PM] bjcullinan: U is the echelon form
[04/01/2009 10:24:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: u is just an upper triangular matrix
[04/01/2009 10:25:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: which i guess is in echelon form by definition
[04/01/2009 10:25:19 PM] bjcullinan: which can be found by reducing to echelon form
[04/01/2009 10:25:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: no reducing is necessary
[04/01/2009 10:27:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: those four equations i gave you reduce to, U11 = 4, U12=-3, L21*U11=12, and L21*U12 + U22=-6
[04/01/2009 10:28:15 PM] Crystal Diaz: which implies L21=3
[04/01/2009 10:28:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: and...
[04/01/2009 10:28:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: you know!
[04/01/2009 10:40:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: still need help
[04/01/2009 10:40:45 PM] bjcullinan: maybe in the later problems
[04/01/2009 10:41:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you figure out $?
[04/01/2009 10:41:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: 4?
[04/01/2009 10:42:00 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[04/01/2009 10:44:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: but do you know how to do it in general?!!?
[04/01/2009 10:44:29 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[04/01/2009 10:44:59 PM] bjcullinan: but how do i use the LU to solve a system?
[04/01/2009 10:45:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: hold on pepe
[04/01/2009 10:48:50 PM] bjcullinan: help with 8 9 and 10?
[04/01/2009 10:49:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: not how to solve  a system using LU?
[04/01/2009 10:49:16 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[04/01/2009 10:49:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[04/01/2009 10:49:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you know how?
[04/01/2009 10:50:04 PM] bjcullinan: i do not know how
[04/01/2009 10:50:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: so help on 6 too?
[04/01/2009 10:50:27 PM] bjcullinan: ya
[04/01/2009 10:50:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: well first you find L and U
[04/01/2009 10:51:00 PM] bjcullinan: yup got it
[04/01/2009 10:52:02 PM] bjcullinan: so?
[04/01/2009 10:52:04 PM] bjcullinan: what next?
[04/01/2009 10:52:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: then instead of solving Ax=b you have (LU)x=b so you solve Ly=b (replace Ux with y)  and that will give you a y1,y2,y3 then you solve, Ux=y for x
[04/01/2009 10:52:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: Ly=b solve for y
[04/01/2009 10:52:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: Ux=y solve for x
[04/01/2009 10:52:32 PM] bjcullinan: woah
[04/01/2009 10:52:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: got it?
[04/01/2009 10:53:46 PM] bjcullinan: no
[04/01/2009 10:54:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean understand
[04/01/2009 10:55:54 PM] bjcullinan: not at all
[04/01/2009 10:55:57 PM] bjcullinan: my head hurts
[04/01/2009 10:56:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: well you know how to solve Ax=b usually right?
[04/01/2009 10:56:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: you know A and you know b and you find x
[04/01/2009 10:57:29 PM] bjcullinan: i think i need an example
[04/01/2009 10:57:40 PM] bjcullinan: with values from problem 6 in it
[04/01/2009 10:57:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[04/01/2009 10:57:56 PM] bjcullinan: i am really good at putting together relationships
[04/01/2009 10:57:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[04/01/2009 10:58:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: you know A = LU
[04/01/2009 10:58:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: and you have L = 1 0 0; 4 1 0; 0 2 1
[04/01/2009 10:58:37 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you solve 100
[04/01/2009 10:58:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry
1 0 0
[04/01/2009 10:58:48 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry
[04/01/2009 10:59:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: 1 0 0
4 1 0
[04/01/2009 10:59:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry
[04/01/2009 10:59:05 PM] bjcullinan: what is the equation that i use
[04/01/2009 10:59:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok you use
[04/01/2009 10:59:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: well you do the row echelon stuff
[04/01/2009 11:00:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: you make a matrix
1 0 0  |  11
4 1 0  |  32
0 2 1  |  -12
[04/01/2009 11:00:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: you do row operations to make the right side in row echlon form
[04/01/2009 11:01:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: so first you do r2 <- r2 + (-4)r1
[04/01/2009 11:01:55 PM] bjcullinan: make L echelon form, got it
[04/01/2009 11:02:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: make L echelon form with b
[04/01/2009 11:02:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then by doing that, you find x
[04/01/2009 11:02:38 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/01/2009 11:02:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: i mean y
[04/01/2009 11:03:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: tell me wen you have y
[04/01/2009 11:04:53 PM] bjcullinan: making L echelon form just gives me I
[04/01/2009 11:05:08 PM] bjcullinan: ohhhh
[04/01/2009 11:05:11 PM] bjcullinan: with b
[04/01/2009 11:05:12 PM] bjcullinan: sec
[04/01/2009 11:07:02 PM] bjcullinan: k now i have 
 1  0  0  11
 0  1  0  -12
 0  0  1  12
[04/01/2009 11:07:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: now you solve
1  4 -1  |  11
0 -3  0  |  -12
0  0  3  |  12
[04/01/2009 11:07:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: and your answer is x
[04/01/2009 11:08:35 PM] bjcullinan: ooooooooHhhhhhhh
[04/01/2009 11:08:45 PM] bjcullinan: now i need help with finding the determinant of a 3x3
[04/01/2009 11:09:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: the way i do it is the wayi learned in physics
[04/01/2009 11:09:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: your write the matrix twice next to eachother
[04/01/2009 11:10:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: well
[04/01/2009 11:11:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: there are actually two ways
[04/01/2009 11:11:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: are you comfortable with finding the determininant of a 2x2?
[04/01/2009 11:11:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: heh
[04/01/2009 11:12:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: (Link: http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/explore/emmaspages/option1.html#Det)http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/explore/emmaspages/option1.html#Det
[04/01/2009 11:12:22 PM] Crystal Diaz: go down to the "determinant of a 3x3 matrix" section
[04/01/2009 11:14:08 PM] bjcullinan: 2x2 is easy
[04/01/2009 11:14:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you can make it 3 2x2s
[04/01/2009 11:14:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: if you go to the page
[04/01/2009 11:15:48 PM] bjcullinan: do i have to find the determinate of each 2x2 inside that?
[04/01/2009 11:16:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes
[04/01/2009 11:16:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: no
[04/01/2009 11:16:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: only the bottom three
[04/01/2009 11:16:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: did you go tot eh page?
[04/01/2009 11:17:04 PM] bjcullinan: ya
[04/01/2009 11:17:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: you do the top left entry * the det of the bottom right 2x2 + the top middle entry * the det of the outsides
[04/01/2009 11:17:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: plus the top right entry * the det of the left bottom 2x2
[04/01/2009 11:18:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: or you can do it off any row (or any column)
[04/01/2009 11:18:39 PM] bjcullinan: thats what i meant about finding determinant of each of the 3 matrices
[04/01/2009 11:18:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: what i just told you, you do using the first row, BUT if the 2nd row has two 0s in it, it would have been a lot easier to do it using the 2nd, cuz then you would multiply two of the 2x2s by 0 so you dont even have to find the determinant
[04/01/2009 11:19:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: i throught you meant of each 2x2 possible
[04/01/2009 11:20:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: you basically "cover up" the row and column of the first entry and multiply the entry by the determinant of what is not covered up,. then cover up the row and column of the second entry and multiply it by the determinant of what isnt covered up and then do the same for the thrid, then add them all up
[04/01/2009 11:21:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: you chose the row that has the most 0s to make it easy
[04/01/2009 11:21:52 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[04/01/2009 11:26:37 PM] bjcullinan:   Know how to find determinants by row reduction to echelon (upper triangular) form  
[04/01/2009 11:26:45 PM] bjcullinan: is that different from what we did?
[04/01/2009 11:26:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: hmm
[04/01/2009 11:27:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[04/01/2009 11:27:08 PM] bjcullinan: determinant of a triangular matrix?
[04/01/2009 11:27:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: its the product of the diagonals
[04/01/2009 11:28:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think
[04/01/2009 11:28:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes it is
[04/01/2009 11:28:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: so you can do it the way we did it, or you can do it by making it a triangular, then multiplying the diagonals 
[04/01/2009 11:30:18 PM] bjcullinan: ohhh
[04/01/2009 11:30:19 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/01/2009 11:36:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: how ar eyou doing baby?
[04/01/2009 11:36:28 PM] bjcullinan: i'm ok
[04/01/2009 11:40:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: me want shrooms
[04/01/2009 11:41:01 PM] bjcullinan: why?
[04/01/2009 11:41:03 PM] bjcullinan: those are gross
[04/01/2009 11:41:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz theya re goood
[04/01/2009 11:43:10 PM] bjcullinan: are we going to have to memorize all the properties of vector spaces?
[04/01/2009 11:43:14 PM] bjcullinan: or does he give them to us?
[04/01/2009 11:43:14 PM] *** Disconnected from server.
[04/01/2009 11:43:31 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not sure
[04/01/2009 11:43:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: additivity scalar multiplicity?
[04/01/2009 11:43:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know what properities you mean?
[04/01/2009 11:44:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: make sure you know he juicy stuff
[04/01/2009 11:44:54 PM] bjcullinan: yeah those are them
[04/01/2009 11:48:14 PM] bjcullinan: i'll finish studying in the morning
[04/01/2009 11:48:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok love
[04/01/2009 11:48:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: goodnight!!!!

[04/05/2009 10:57:06 PM] bjcullinan: as long as the fans work it will be fine
[04/05/2009 10:57:12 PM] Crystal Diaz: but what about my screen
[04/05/2009 10:57:21 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont want it to, how you say, ghost
[04/05/2009 10:58:06 PM] bjcullinan: go to power settings
[04/05/2009 10:58:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok i figured it out
[04/05/2009 10:58:16 PM] bjcullinan: and set the screen to turn off after a few minutes
[04/05/2009 10:58:26 PM] bjcullinan: online clock is a pretty good idea
[04/05/2009 10:58:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i was just messin around i know how to change the sleep
[04/05/2009 10:58:33 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[04/05/2009 10:59:01 PM] bjcullinan: ghosting is caused by burn in time
[04/05/2009 10:59:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: ya but i thought that was caused by having something on the screen for way too long
[04/05/2009 10:59:56 PM] bjcullinan: thats the time it takes for your backlights to heat up the lcd
[04/05/2009 11:00:09 PM] bjcullinan: ya that too
[04/05/2009 11:01:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: so as a CS major, did you learn how to design screen savers as they appear random
[04/05/2009 11:01:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: ?
[04/05/2009 11:02:07 PM] bjcullinan: screen savers are just programs that run and stop when you move the mouse
[04/05/2009 11:03:17 PM] bjcullinan: and computer don't do random
[04/05/2009 11:03:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah but the screen savor does "random" movements
[04/05/2009 11:03:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: can you do that?
[04/05/2009 11:04:09 PM] bjcullinan: sure
[04/05/2009 11:04:10 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not talking about the timing logic of when to put it on. I mean once its on
[04/05/2009 11:04:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: oh
[04/05/2009 11:04:33 PM] bjcullinan: didn't you make a random color generator techo flashy thing?
[04/05/2009 11:04:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: aint that cute, cuz it looks like a lot of crazy math to tell these ribbons where to go and how to trail!
[04/05/2009 11:04:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: thas different!
[04/05/2009 11:04:57 PM] bjcullinan: yes, it takes lots of math

After thanksgiving i gave us the chance to work things out, after christmas break is was still a problem, before spring break i gave it another shot, if we break up because you don't put forth the effort to find a job where we can be close together, what makes you think you even deserve to be with me after i get out of college?  why should i keep settling for less then what i deserve and expect out of a relationship?

[04/19/2009 08:58:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: so
[04/19/2009 08:58:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i think i lost 20 dollars
[04/19/2009 08:58:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: i hate to say it
[04/19/2009 08:58:32 PM] bjcullinan: must have been the abridged you were looking at
[04/19/2009 08:58:39 PM] bjcullinan: how did you do that!?
[04/19/2009 09:02:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: well, a friend gave me four bucks, and i gave her two back, and i had been carrying around 40 dollars for a couple days cuz i never took them out of my bunch of cards stack that i put in my pocket every morning, so i had two twenties and two ones. I went to a movie that cost two dollars, and i was standing in line and a girl came up asking if anyone had exact change, so i said yes and gave her the two dollars and went in with my new ticket. But then after the movie we went to College town bagels, and I ordered a sandwich. when i went to pay for it i pulled out two ones first, and i got all confused! i only had two ones, and i gave them to the ticket girl! did i give two twenties to her instead?! and then i found one of the twenties, and paid with that. but i never did find the other twenty.
[04/19/2009 09:04:39 PM] bjcullinan: hmm you'd think the girl that got the twenties would have realized and been nice enough to return it
[04/19/2009 09:06:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: ya i dont know maybe she didnt notice at first either
[04/19/2009 09:06:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just cant believe i could allow that to happen, i pulled out my two bucks i thought
[04/19/2009 09:07:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: somehow i gotta find a way to make 20 bucks i wouldnt normally have, or keep 20 bucks i would normally spend
[04/19/2009 09:08:39 PM] bjcullinan: good plan
[04/19/2009 09:10:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: so like.. i can prostitute myself

[04/19/2009 09:17:31 PM] bjcullinan: hmm what would be worth 20 dollars
[04/19/2009 09:26:12 PM] bjcullinan: i've always wanted to have anal sex and finger you at the same time

[04/25/2009 10:54:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: but decided not to
[04/25/2009 10:55:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: and theni hung around or watched something until chi alpha
[04/25/2009 10:56:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then i went to chi alpha and went through the back like usual and there were so many people in the front doing their protest!
[04/25/2009 10:56:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then we did some singing and praying i didnt feel right
[04/25/2009 10:58:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wanted to leave but i didnt
[04/25/2009 11:00:56 PM] bjcullinan: what were they protesting?
[04/25/2009 11:01:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: matt and tracy herman asked Chris to step down from Chi alpha leadership when chris decided to embrace his gayness
[04/25/2009 11:02:00 PM] Crystal Diaz: and so Chris contacted the Student Assembly people and Chi Alpha got their funding taken awa
[04/25/2009 11:02:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: t
[04/25/2009 11:02:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: y
[04/25/2009 11:03:44 PM] bjcullinan: so they were protesting him being gay?
[04/25/2009 11:03:53 PM] bjcullinan: don't you understand how fucked up they are!?
[04/25/2009 11:04:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: no it was a bunch of GLBT people protesting chi alpha
[04/25/2009 11:04:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: ah
[04/25/2009 11:04:18 PM] bjcullinan: that is bullshit, he followed christ and they turned their back when they found out he was gay?
[04/25/2009 11:04:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: no he was struggling with his gay ness for a while and they knew about it
[04/25/2009 11:05:15 PM] bjcullinan: so why would he have to step down?
[04/25/2009 11:06:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: because he decided to accept his sexuality and embrace his sin
[04/25/2009 11:06:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: so they didnt think someone who decides to keep on sinning is a good example for others as a leader
[04/25/2009 11:07:14 PM] Crystal Diaz: he wasnt asked to leave the group or anything
[04/25/2009 11:07:49 PM] bjcullinan: did he have anal sex?
[04/25/2009 11:08:20 PM] Crystal Diaz: ha i dont know! he had/has a boyfriend
[04/25/2009 11:08:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: (dunno if he still does)
[04/25/2009 11:08:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: its tough cuz he didnt want to get chi alpha in trouble i dontthink ,and they were all friends! Chris lives with chi alpha people
[04/25/2009 11:11:29 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then there were a couple baptisms in the gym pool
[04/25/2009 11:11:38 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then there was a pool party and we playd some water polo
[04/25/2009 11:11:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i was good at it!
[04/25/2009 11:11:45 PM] Crystal Diaz: it was fun.
[04/25/2009 11:12:05 PM] bjcullinan: baptists in the gym pool?

[04/25/2009 11:13:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: the only baptism ive seen on tv was in a lake
[04/25/2009 11:13:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: so i guess they can do it anywhere
[04/25/2009 11:13:41 PM] bjcullinan: pools have chemicals
[04/25/2009 11:13:47 PM] bjcullinan: i've never seen it in a pool
[04/25/2009 11:13:50 PM] bjcullinan: or a lake
[04/25/2009 11:13:53 PM] bjcullinan: only a church
[04/25/2009 11:14:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: idk, i thought it was odd too, but i decided not to think about it too much
[04/25/2009 11:17:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: and then we went to bear necessities
[04/25/2009 11:17:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i had a Cheesy Smash
[04/25/2009 11:17:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: and i did some cartwheels in the grass :)

[04/25/2009 11:21:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: a regular bike with gears and thin wheels, but the handle bars were lower than the seat
[04/25/2009 11:21:15 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[04/25/2009 11:21:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: it really threw off my balance
[04/25/2009 11:21:34 PM] Crystal Diaz: i almost fell!
[04/25/2009 11:21:43 PM] bjcullinan: oh no!
[04/25/2009 11:21:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah, and that was my night

[04/25/2009 11:29:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just dont like it when its in a sentence that makes me actual think about another woman doing stuff to you, especially when its paired with a comparison factor like lap dancing,
[04/25/2009 11:29:26 PM] Crystal Diaz: now i feel i cant ever do it, cuz you've already had a real one, so i cant ever be as good

[04/25/2009 11:57:54 PM] Crystal Diaz: gah you should read these fucking uh things
[04/25/2009 11:58:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: "Bachelors or Masters grads that represent the top 10% of their graduating classes. Prefer Ivy League, but exceptional candidates from top tier 1 schools are encouraged to apply.  PLEASE NOTE:  This position does NOT require previous portfolio management or investing experience; however, does require a very process oriented mind, past track record of process iomprovement and exceptional quantitative skills."
[04/25/2009 11:58:48 PM] bjcullinan: sounds good
[04/25/2009 11:58:52 PM] bjcullinan: what does it mean?
[04/25/2009 11:58:56 PM] bjcullinan: are you applying?
[04/26/2009 12:00:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: im not applying
[04/26/2009 12:00:24 AM] bjcullinan: maybe the employers that shop for kids from ivy league schools don't know how to appreciate people, that's a bullshit standard to set for hiring applicants.  you have to prove to them that you are the best in your field even though your GPA is lower then top 10%.
[04/26/2009 12:00:27 AM] Crystal Diaz: i dont have a 3.5/4
[04/26/2009 12:00:42 AM] bjcullinan: what company is that for because it's sounds pretty stuck up
[04/26/2009 12:01:20 AM] Crystal Diaz: i know huh!
[04/26/2009 12:02:58 AM] Crystal Diaz: Northwest Integrators LLC but they dont seem to have a website
[04/26/2009 12:03:40 AM] bjcullinan: GPA never reflects a persons intelligence, the system is broken, they probably just post that to scare people away because they have so many applications
[04/26/2009 12:04:21 AM] bjcullinan: lol
[04/26/2009 12:04:26 AM] Crystal Diaz: im not gonna work for corporate douchebags like that
[04/26/2009 12:04:27 AM] bjcullinan: what company doesn't have a website?
[04/26/2009 12:04:38 AM] Crystal Diaz: Northwest Integratosrs
[04/26/2009 12:04:59 AM] bjcullinan: looks like a bogus job
[04/26/2009 12:05:09 AM] bjcullinan: be careful who you give all your information to
[04/26/2009 12:05:50 AM] Crystal Diaz: there are 0 resumes submitted for those jobs
[04/26/2009 12:06:43 AM] bjcullinan: maybe you should take the challenge at full force and submit to jobs that have other applications
[04/26/2009 12:06:44 AM] Crystal Diaz: should i bother looking at boston mass jobs?
[04/26/2009 12:06:52 AM] bjcullinan: and come up with a way to advertise yourself
[04/26/2009 12:06:55 AM] Crystal Diaz: no thats the point
[04/26/2009 12:07:02 AM] Crystal Diaz: the description is so stuck up
[04/26/2009 12:07:06 AM] Crystal Diaz: that no one is applying!
[04/26/2009 12:07:23 AM] bjcullinan: yeah

[05/06/2009 03:22:06 PM] bjcullinan: tell them you did not have a personal experience

[05/06/2009 03:42:58 PM] bjcullinan: *harder
[05/06/2009 03:43:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: When it comes to tough school work situations, sometimes things aren't as bad as they seem, and it is useful to get help early. If you get stuck, try working in different environments or around different people.

The project should not be taken lightly and requires as much work each week as a regular course. Make weekly goals and maintain good communication with your team. A mission statement can help drive your work in the right direction when things start to look too vague.
[05/06/2009 03:43:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: easier said than done :)

[05/17/2009 03:53:53 PM] Crystal Diaz: it shows kids in the passion of the holy spirit
[05/17/2009 03:53:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: and its weird
[05/17/2009 03:53:58 PM] Crystal Diaz: cuz they are kids!
[05/17/2009 03:54:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: \and it shows some of their family life
[05/17/2009 03:55:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: its just so jesus centered its like wow
[05/17/2009 03:55:18 PM] Crystal Diaz: im convinced im going to hell!
[05/17/2009 03:55:27 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont like them

[05/17/2009 03:57:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: like my friends
[05/17/2009 03:57:13 PM] bjcullinan: sorry i was searching for stuff
[05/17/2009 03:57:23 PM] bjcullinan: you aren't going to hell
[05/17/2009 03:57:30 PM] Crystal Diaz: am too!
[05/17/2009 03:57:37 PM] bjcullinan: they make to feel bad for being a free thinker
[05/17/2009 03:58:00 PM] bjcullinan: that's what they want you to think so they can make you apart of the collective
[05/17/2009 03:58:34 PM] bjcullinan: just because you don't accept everything they tell you, for their interpretation of the bible, doesn't mean you are a bad person
[05/17/2009 03:59:03 PM] Crystal Diaz: i will never be a part of their collective
[05/17/2009 03:59:17 PM] bjcullinan: good
[05/17/2009 03:59:23 PM] Crystal Diaz: i believe they interpret the bible just fine
[05/17/2009 03:59:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just dont like th bible
[05/17/2009 04:00:54 PM] bjcullinan: so there are stories jesus tells that are supposed to be examples of things we should do
[05/17/2009 04:01:14 PM] bjcullinan: there are some things that should be taken figuratively, not literaly
[05/17/2009 04:01:24 PM] bjcullinan: and it is up to the interpreter
[05/17/2009 04:01:28 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont know man
[05/17/2009 04:01:44 PM] Crystal Diaz: it think its all a crack!
[05/17/2009 04:02:24 PM] bjcullinan: but if a person takes the entire bible literally without question, it is healthy, there is no balance between logic and faith and life
[05/17/2009 04:02:41 PM] bjcullinan: and if all you have in life is your faith, then you are willing to die for it
[05/17/2009 04:02:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: whatever
[05/17/2009 04:02:47 PM] bjcullinan: and you are willing to kill for it
[05/17/2009 04:03:18 PM] bjcullinan: and that's what happens when we get "terrorists"
[05/17/2009 04:03:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: whatever
[05/17/2009 04:04:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: could we never talk about god again thx
[05/17/2009 04:04:15 PM] bjcullinan: baby
[05/17/2009 04:04:21 PM] bjcullinan: come on, don't be like that
[05/17/2009 04:04:27 PM] bjcullinan: just don't worry about it
[05/17/2009 04:04:32 PM] Crystal Diaz: i can be however i want
[05/17/2009 04:04:40 PM] bjcullinan: you hold yourself to too high of standards
[05/17/2009 04:05:30 PM] bjcullinan: you don't have to be an extremist, to still have good faith
[05/17/2009 04:05:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: naw
[05/17/2009 04:05:51 PM] Crystal Diaz: im fine with shit faith
[05/17/2009 04:06:24 PM] bjcullinan: see that's why i wish you hadn't done this without me
[05/17/2009 04:06:55 PM] bjcullinan: you ran off with the wrong crowd, and now they have ruined you
[05/17/2009 04:06:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt do anything
[05/17/2009 04:07:04 PM] Crystal Diaz: they arent the wrong crowd
[05/17/2009 04:07:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: they are regular christians
[05/17/2009 04:07:21 PM] bjcullinan: and have this incredibly skewed view of what religion is, and how to balance it with the rest of your life
[05/17/2009 04:07:32 PM] bjcullinan: they aren't fucking regular!
[05/17/2009 04:07:33 PM] Crystal Diaz: dont talk to me about religion please!!@!!!
[05/17/2009 04:07:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes they are!!
[05/17/2009 04:07:49 PM] bjcullinan: they are not
[05/17/2009 04:07:54 PM] bjcullinan: and that's why your view is skewed
[05/17/2009 04:07:56 PM] Crystal Diaz: yes they are
[05/17/2009 04:08:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: fuck you
[05/17/2009 04:08:06 PM] bjcullinan: you can't tell who is "too into it"
[05/17/2009 04:08:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont care
[05/17/2009 04:08:23 PM] bjcullinan: you can't tell who doesn't have balance in their lives
[05/17/2009 04:09:05 PM] Crystal Diaz: they have fine balance
[05/17/2009 04:09:09 PM] Crystal Diaz: quit talking about them
[05/17/2009 04:09:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: you dotn know them
[05/17/2009 04:10:11 PM] bjcullinan: i can't believe you're so upset about this
[05/17/2009 04:10:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: if we never talk about them or the whole thng agian then there is no problem
[05/17/2009 04:10:51 PM] bjcullinan: there must be something we have to get past here because you keep bringing it up, and then you get upset about it
[05/17/2009 04:11:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: im sorry i was just telling you about a film
[05/17/2009 04:11:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: i wont bring it up again
[05/17/2009 04:13:01 PM] bjcullinan: i can't believe you said "fuck you"
[05/17/2009 04:13:35 PM] Crystal Diaz: well you keep badmouthing my friends!
[05/17/2009 04:13:39 PM] Crystal Diaz: it doesnt feel good
[05/17/2009 04:13:49 PM] bjcullinan: i am not bad mouthing them!
[05/17/2009 04:14:06 PM] bjcullinan: i am not saying they are bad people
[05/17/2009 04:14:14 PM] bjcullinan: i am saying they believe in something different
[05/17/2009 04:14:40 PM] bjcullinan: just because they don't have balance doesn't make them better or worse
[05/17/2009 04:14:44 PM] bjcullinan: you said it yourself
[05/17/2009 04:14:52 PM] Crystal Diaz: they do have balance
[05/17/2009 04:15:01 PM] bjcullinan: you're last boyfriend was all about sex, and luke was all about god
[05/17/2009 04:15:55 PM] Crystal Diaz: ok
[05/17/2009 04:16:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: my last boyfriend called himself a christian
[05/17/2009 04:16:06 PM] Crystal Diaz: he didnt like that i wasnt
[05/17/2009 04:16:23 PM] bjcullinan: but you said luke was all about god
[05/17/2009 04:16:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i didnt like that he called himself a christian and still had sex with me
[05/17/2009 04:16:32 PM] bjcullinan: where is the balance there?  you said it yourself.
[05/17/2009 04:16:40 PM] Crystal Diaz: reminds me of someone else!

[05/17/2009 04:17:25 PM] Crystal Diaz: im not the one who believes in god
[05/17/2009 04:18:23 PM] bjcullinan: so... the things i try to tell you about god go through one ear and out the next, because you don't feel like i am a credible source
[05/17/2009 04:18:50 PM] Crystal Diaz: no thats not it
[05/17/2009 04:18:56 PM] bjcullinan: so my logic for having sex, isn't enough for you?
[05/17/2009 04:19:36 PM] Crystal Diaz: well.... i guess not, but im not against it
[05/17/2009 04:20:08 PM] Crystal Diaz: i feel like someone shouldsnt have to come up with an explanation
[05/17/2009 04:20:16 PM] Crystal Diaz: they do it or they dont
[05/17/2009 04:20:38 PM] bjcullinan: yeah, and that's something i choose to do because i have balance in my life and faith
[05/17/2009 04:20:47 PM] Crystal Diaz: and if they do it
[05/17/2009 04:20:49 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats against god
[05/17/2009 04:21:02 PM] bjcullinan: but it's balance
[05/17/2009 04:21:15 PM] bjcullinan: something a lot of people don't have
[05/17/2009 04:21:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: i just dont feel like you can be a half christian and call it balance
[05/17/2009 04:22:19 PM] Crystal Diaz: hay babe
[05/17/2009 04:22:24 PM] Crystal Diaz: have you seen th movie Hot Fuzz?

[05/17/2009 04:22:46 PM] Crystal Diaz: brian
[05/17/2009 04:22:59 PM] Crystal Diaz: of course you are good enough!
[05/17/2009 04:23:17 PM] Crystal Diaz: why is it called Hot Fuzz?
[05/17/2009 04:23:35 PM] bjcullinan: you have this incredibly high expectation for everything!  things can't be good, or fine, everything has to be perfect and the best with you.
[05/17/2009 04:23:42 PM] Crystal Diaz: brian
[05/17/2009 04:23:43 PM] Crystal Diaz: !
[05/17/2009 04:23:52 PM] bjcullinan: you know how you said your last boyfriend was all about sex
[05/17/2009 04:24:02 PM] Crystal Diaz: i dont give a shit about if we have sex or not and if you think its bad or not and if your logic makes sense or not
[05/17/2009 04:24:07 PM] bjcullinan: you are all about worrying that everything won't be perfect
[05/17/2009 04:24:11 PM] Crystal Diaz: thats the beauty of not being religious!
[05/17/2009 04:24:38 PM] bjcullinan: you should give a shit about it because it matters to me

[05/17/2009 05:23:47 PM] bjcullinan: you know it's kind of weird you say "talking" because once you said "fuck you", it started to sound a lot more like an argument
[05/17/2009 05:24:01 PM] Crystal Diaz: yeah
[05/17/2009 05:24:13 PM] Crystal Diaz: sorry dude
