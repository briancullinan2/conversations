[01/29/2009 01:32:18 PM] Tim Sapio: hey, brian, when you come in today, please check Charlie Schlinger's computer out for him. When printing from Microsoft Office programs to the printer in 315, he is having issues with the printer thinking that it is printing to legal-sized paper when it should be printing to standard. If you can determine/fix the problem, talk to Charlie and give him instructions on how to avoid these issues in the future.
