[01/14/2005 01:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok then insert the other CD
[01/14/2005 01:50 PM] Brian: maps
[01/14/2005 01:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and install All Seeing Eye, and copy the map files over, don't copy the folder or zip files
[01/14/2005 01:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all you want are the .pk3 files
[01/14/2005 01:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: copy those into q3ut3
[01/14/2005 01:52 PM] Brian: wheres All Seeing Eye
[01/14/2005 01:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: on the CD with the Maps
[01/14/2005 01:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its called eyeinstaller
[01/14/2005 01:52 PM] Brian: its on the other

[01/14/2005 01:53 PM] Brian: does it matter if i install the maps then the eye thingy
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do the eyeinstaller first
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we can play
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then you will be able to see which maps you need
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and which ones you already have
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: remember you just want .pk3 files
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] Brian: ok
[01/14/2005 01:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no folders or .zip files, extract them first if they are zipped and copy them to your q3ut3 folder
[01/14/2005 01:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but you don't need any maps to play on my server
[01/14/2005 01:55 PM] Brian: ok
[01/14/2005 01:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it plays all the maps that come with urban terror
[01/14/2005 01:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so install eye and go through that short setup and then we can play
[01/14/2005 01:57 PM] Brian: do i need to read the tutorial
[01/14/2005 01:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no

[01/14/2005 02:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[01/14/2005 02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: one more thing to try
[01/14/2005 02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: before i come over

[01/14/2005 02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and select properties
[01/14/2005 02:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then a tab window will come up, click hardware

[01/14/2005 02:20 PM] Brian: thats it
[01/14/2005 02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's what i was afraid of
[01/14/2005 02:20 PM] Brian: ok
[01/14/2005 02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it could be that your graphics card can't handle it
[01/14/2005 02:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you play any other video games?
[01/14/2005 02:21 PM] Brian: what kind do i need
[01/14/2005 02:21 PM] Brian: yes

[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] Brian: no
[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean do you press esc, because it will take a few seconds before it starts
[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it goes straight to the main screen?
[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] Brian: i press esc when the screen comes up
[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] Brian: yes
[01/14/2005 02:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: don't do that then
[01/14/2005 02:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: let it keep loading and don't press escape
[01/14/2005 02:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and see what happens
[01/14/2005 02:23 PM] Brian: but everything is in boxes
