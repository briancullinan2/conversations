[03/05/2005 12:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you always can just copy them over
[03/05/2005 12:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you just can't use any fancy stuff like forms and certain buttons from front page
[03/05/2005 12:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you have to script them all yourself
[03/05/2005 12:37 PM] James: oh
[03/05/2005 12:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just copy over the html files yourself
[03/05/2005 12:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: go to my documents/my webs/site name/files
[03/05/2005 12:38 PM] James: "the server may not have front page extensions installed"
[03/05/2005 12:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[03/05/2005 12:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just copy them over yourself
[03/05/2005 12:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: front page is to stupid to realize that none of your pages need the front page extensions yet it has to have them there anyways
[03/05/2005 12:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: are you trying to ftp them to your own drive? or is there a local network option?
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] James: ftp
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wrong
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: apache doesn't support ftp
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] James: oh
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] James: ummm
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is why it is an HTTP server
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] James: oh gotcha
[03/05/2005 12:41 PM] James: what were you using @ school to upload that stuff to your site then?
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that was a php thing
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] James: oh
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i think frontpage has a local option
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] James: not sure
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah right there
[03/05/2005 12:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: go to File/Publish Site
[03/05/2005 12:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and click the "File System" option
[03/05/2005 12:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that will show a folder path
[03/05/2005 12:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: right?
[03/05/2005 12:45 PM] James: yea
[03/05/2005 12:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now click browse and point to your htdocs folder
[03/05/2005 12:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but you should make a sub folder if you plan to have more than 1 site, you can always do that later though
[03/05/2005 12:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now try to publish
[03/05/2005 12:47 PM] James: okay
[03/05/2005 12:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did it work?
[03/05/2005 12:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now click publish
[03/05/2005 12:47 PM] James: 1 sec
