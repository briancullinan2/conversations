Huitzilopoctli: yur grounded?
Zero{Grounded from the comp}: I had nothing to say  
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me  
And I let it all out to find /that I'm  
Not the only person with these things in mind  
But all the vacancy the words revealed  
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel  
Just stuck/hollow and alone  
And the fault is my own  
And the fault is my own  
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone 
And I've got nothing to say  
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face  
Looking everywhere/only to find that it's  
Not the way I had imagined it all in my mind 
What do I have but negativity  
'Cause I can't justify the  
Way everyone is looking at me  
Nothing to gain/hollow and alone  
And the fault is my own  
The fault is my own  
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone 
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
