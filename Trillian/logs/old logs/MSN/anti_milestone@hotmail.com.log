[04/16/2006 01:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[04/16/2006 01:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it either ruined apache or PHP
[04/16/2006 01:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i am pretty sure its apache because even when the page loads it shows up without images as if they just didn't send
[04/16/2006 01:22 AM] David McAarthur: hmm
[04/16/2006 01:22 AM] David McAarthur: you check the log messages/

[05/15/2006 09:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok what do you think of this idea, instead of having a files section where you upload everything, instead i just put the upload on every page if you go to a directory that belongs to you, and files becomes just general files
[05/15/2006 09:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you think?
[05/15/2006 09:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like if you are logged in and you click on your log in name, then you can upload
[05/15/2006 09:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: make sense?

[05/15/2006 10:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i put it on the sides, in a normal case it would be in between the panel and the hard drive mounts, standing up vertically
[05/15/2006 10:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but because my case is 1337, it shines through all the front panels because its a full tower, and has this like net thing in each little panel

[05/16/2006 08:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: he acts like the only safe software to use is the stuff that either comes with your hardware, or if he uses

[05/22/2006 05:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wanted to see that
[05/22/2006 05:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: based on a true story
[05/22/2006 05:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you believe in hauntings?
[05/22/2006 05:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: unrest of spirits?
[05/22/2006 05:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: an alternate dimension for the dead
[05/22/2006 05:36 PM] David McAarthur: nope
[05/22/2006 05:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or even people becoming possessed with demons trying to escape hell?
[05/22/2006 05:36 PM] David McAarthur: nope
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what would it take to make you believe?
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] David McAarthur: cant ever really know, but yeh i dont think so
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: to witness it for yourself?
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] David McAarthur: theres nothing that could make me belive it either way
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not through a movie screen?
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] David McAarthur: because you cant prove it either way
[05/22/2006 05:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even if you were to experience it first hand
[05/22/2006 05:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if we were to stay the night in a haunted house, and weird shit happened you still wouldn't believe?
[05/22/2006 05:38 PM] David McAarthur: believe what?
[05/22/2006 05:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that hauntings were real
[05/22/2006 05:39 PM] David McAarthur: id belive that theres things we cant explain
[05/22/2006 05:39 PM] David McAarthur: but i already belive that
[05/22/2006 05:41 PM] David McAarthur: do you belive in hauntings?
[05/22/2006 05:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/22/2006 05:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there is too much evidence not too
[05/22/2006 05:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe i just know too much
[05/22/2006 05:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but there really are houses considered haunted
[05/22/2006 05:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and we could venture to one of them and spend the night there
[05/22/2006 05:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fuck there are a lot of super hero movies coming out this summer
[05/22/2006 05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i believe in people becoming possessed
[05/22/2006 05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its how satan does his dirty work
[05/22/2006 05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i also believe in God
[05/22/2006 05:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: therefore there are limits
[05/22/2006 05:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like no demon can pass into this world, its against the rules and god would start the holy war, revelations, the rapture, that is if any demon ever did
[05/22/2006 05:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and hauntings are rejected spirits, not suitable for heaven or hell
[05/22/2006 05:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: either that or they are just concentrated energy
[05/22/2006 05:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: every person guilty of murder in a specific incident leaves behind a terrible guilt and it lingers and builds up
[05/22/2006 05:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all the fear from people that get caught in the middle make it more powerful
[05/22/2006 05:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i am just speculating
[05/22/2006 05:48 PM] David McAarthur: cool
[05/22/2006 05:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its been proven that through thought and concentration, moods can be changed right?
[05/22/2006 05:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so what if that feeling was so intense that it caused something to move, or break
[05/22/2006 05:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: something people might call a hauntined
[05/22/2006 05:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *haunting
[05/22/2006 05:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that energy couldn't escape, so it keeps building
[05/22/2006 05:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think we should go to a haunted house and find out for ourselves, take keifer too
[05/22/2006 05:52 PM] David McAarthur: i dont see how changing moods and telekinesis are connected
[05/22/2006 05:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: just the energy is the same
[05/22/2006 05:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if it was powerful enough i think it could change physical objects instead of just mental

[05/24/2006 11:26 AM] David McAarthur: maxivista?
[05/24/2006 11:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thanks
[05/24/2006 11:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah you can not only do mouse and keyboard but it actually creates a remote virtual display on another computer
[05/24/2006 11:27 AM] David McAarthur: like vnc?
[05/24/2006 11:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: vnc?

[05/24/2006 11:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you have 3 displays?
[05/24/2006 11:28 AM] David McAarthur: oh no
[05/24/2006 11:28 AM] David McAarthur: like kde & gnome then?
[05/24/2006 11:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah see this adds on to the video drivers and extends your desktop to a 3rd monitor
[05/24/2006 11:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: through another computer, and across an internet connection
[05/24/2006 11:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so its list i have 3 monitors now, but you can do up to 4 just with maxivista, so i could potentially have 6 monitors

[05/24/2006 11:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you could still use maxivista, just use your laptop as the server
[05/24/2006 11:36 AM] David McAarthur: no
[05/24/2006 11:36 AM] David McAarthur: just says so on the pagge

[05/24/2006 11:42 AM] David McAarthur: i was looking at the helix media streaming 
[05/24/2006 11:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and resources would be allocated properly, and you would get it as a video file
[05/24/2006 11:42 AM] David McAarthur: but that looks better
[05/24/2006 11:43 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i think this does more

[05/24/2006 11:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am happy with this player, it can output video in different formats, you can chose the module and it will use that to play it
[05/24/2006 11:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have this other one FrameShots
[05/24/2006 11:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i am trying to hack it
[05/24/2006 11:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its a lot simpler, it just outputs the number of images you specify, instead of a certain number of images per second
