[12/06/2005 11:14 PM] Keifer Street: what's the difference?
[12/06/2005 11:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: trillian has a Gmail notifier

[12/07/2005 11:29 AM] Keifer Street: I'm up
[12/07/2005 11:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hey do you know how i could connect to the wireless internet with my PSP
[12/07/2005 11:30 AM] Keifer Street: Well, with any normal internet connection you have to set up a VPN to connect properly
[12/07/2005 11:30 AM] Keifer Street: vpn.nau.edu
[12/07/2005 11:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see they just implements music streaming through RSS feeds, and i was up all night programming my music library into making XML feeds for my PSP, but i can only use it through my router
[12/07/2005 11:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: didn't work
[12/07/2005 11:32 AM] Keifer Street: Then you have to go through the NAU Registration process... I do not think there is any easy way to connect your PSP to the internet because you'd have to find a way to bypass NAU Registration and a way to set up a VPN on your PSP
[12/07/2005 11:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it supports WEP
[12/07/2005 11:34 AM] Keifer Street: What is WEP?
[12/07/2005 11:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the encryption
[12/07/2005 11:34 AM] Keifer Street: For?
[12/07/2005 11:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like entering a password
[12/07/2005 11:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't understand how to use VPN
[12/07/2005 11:35 AM] Keifer Street: haha
[12/07/2005 11:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do i have to install anything? why can't i just connect to that NAU network?
[12/07/2005 11:35 AM] Keifer Street: Yeah, I've only had to set it up once
[12/07/2005 11:36 AM] Keifer Street: Well... through Windows you have to go through the Wireless connection setup wizard
[12/07/2005 11:36 AM] Keifer Street: and enter the correct settings
[12/07/2005 11:36 AM] Keifer Street: Beyond that, my memory fades
[12/07/2005 11:36 AM] Keifer Street: There is something else that you have to do before you can connect wirelessly; I'm not sure if its Registration or something more...
[12/07/2005 11:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to find this out so i can listen to my RSS Feeds on my way to class
[12/07/2005 11:39 AM] Keifer Street: What is an RSS Feed?
[12/07/2005 11:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: omfg
[12/07/2005 11:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its a feed that changes frequently
[12/07/2005 11:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its a type of standard XML
[12/07/2005 11:40 AM] Keifer Street: Oh, Ok, I suppose that helps, but I don't exactly know what XML is either
[12/07/2005 11:40 AM] Keifer Street: lol
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: XML is amazing
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] Keifer Street: How would you listen to these feeds on the way to class, wirelessly or after you download them onto your PSP?
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] Keifer Street: I would love to stay and chat, but I have an appointment in Gillenwater at 12:00pm
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] Keifer Street: See ya
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its RSS
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it doesn't need to be downloaded
[12/07/2005 11:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its streaming
[12/07/2005 11:42 AM] Keifer Street: Yeah, but how would you find a wireless connection all the way to class
[12/07/2005 11:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it will be around the builings

[01/18/2006 09:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i think this was the end of my winning streak
[01/18/2006 09:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i know this girl that i really want to be involved with, and it would definitely be more meaningful then a one night stand
[01/18/2006 09:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but she lives far away so i have to wait
[01/18/2006 09:46 PM] Keifer Street: Probably just my Christian views I guess...
[01/18/2006 09:46 PM] Keifer Street: haha
[01/18/2006 09:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah probably

[01/18/2006 09:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i promise that if we did room together next year one night stands amongst other things would be completely inappropriate activity
[01/18/2006 09:50 PM] Keifer Street: hhaaha
[01/18/2006 09:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so please don't let what i said earlier discourage you from wanting to room together

[01/18/2006 09:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know i know, and you're completely right
[01/18/2006 09:51 PM] Keifer Street: You said you're not a practicing Catholic... fine... then why not be a practicing Christian?
[01/18/2006 09:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't practice because of my views on religion
[01/18/2006 09:52 PM] Keifer Street: oh?
[01/18/2006 09:52 PM] Keifer Street: Which are?
[01/18/2006 09:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'd prefer we didn't talk about it, but i think my strick catholic upbringing has also pushed me away from practicing on my own
[01/18/2006 09:53 PM] Keifer Street: Well, if you ever have questions about stuff like that, don't be afraid to ask man...
[01/18/2006 09:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thanks man

[02/08/2006 12:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what does god say about masterbation?  do i have to stop downloading porn?  i can't even count the number of times i've claimed that i download it because the models are beautiful and i don't get off to it.  i want to go with you to a meeting and i want to borrow a bible, i couldn't tell you how many times i got chills, when you first started talking my heart sank and i felt guilty for denying god because of being forcefully raised with him in my life
[02/08/2006 12:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: this is a lot for me to take in, but i'd like to try to believe, if it is meant to happen it will
[02/08/2006 12:24 AM] Keifer Street: Hey man, I really can't tell you what to do.. but I am extremely glad that you're thinking about these things honestly... however... Jesus said, "if you even 'look' at a person with lust (sexual desire/want), then you're guilty of adultery by heart"... so, I would have to say 'no', but if you honestly do not do those sort of 'things', then having a model of a beautiful woman (like sports illistate
[02/08/2006 12:25 AM] Keifer Street: d model... not playboy)... would be OK... but the stipiulation is IF you honestly didn't think those types of things about those people
[02/08/2006 12:25 AM] Keifer Street: but...
[02/08/2006 12:25 AM] Keifer Street: I'll level with you brain
[02/08/2006 12:26 AM] Keifer Street: I've been struggling with mastrobation (not even about my girlfriend) for years... all the way up unto a few weeks ago... What I ended up doing was downloading the most secure program on the planet (CyberPatrol) and gave the password to Vu.... I only knew that those things would have led to the break-up of me and my girlfriend and that my life would be empty if I continued with this 'animalistic s
[02/08/2006 12:26 AM] Keifer Street: atistaction of my bodily lusts;
[02/08/2006 12:27 AM] Keifer Street: Do you know why God gave men rules to follow?
[02/08/2006 12:28 AM] Keifer Street: To help them... when he told Eve not to eat of the tree of good and evil... he did so because he didn't want them to have to work or bear children... he wanted to make their lives easier
[02/08/2006 12:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it doesn't make sense, what is god invented lust so encourage re-population, then of course to ballence the lust there is love and marraige, lust is sometimes essential the original attraction to your sould counterpart may only take place if lust was initially present but then replaced by love
[02/08/2006 12:28 AM] Keifer Street: haha...
[02/08/2006 12:28 AM] Keifer Street: God did not 'invent' lust.... Satan did, you see, God gave people the 'natural' feelings of physical attraction between the opposite sex..
[02/08/2006 12:29 AM] Keifer Street: However,
[02/08/2006 12:29 AM] Keifer Street: Satan to the 'natural' and turned it into 'sexual' feelings
[02/08/2006 12:29 AM] Keifer Street: You see...
[02/08/2006 12:29 AM] Keifer Street: Its perfectly natural for you to be attracted to women, that's how God desinged it
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: But.... to want to ravish and have sex with them (or sexual favors) is NOT something God implaned in you from birth
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: Example:
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: When you're a child... did you ever lust after another person (I mean like at age 5)?
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: No
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: But...
[02/08/2006 12:30 AM] Keifer Street: You might have 'liked' somebody or had a crush
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] Keifer Street: That childlike crush is the type of love and attraction that God designed it to be
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] Keifer Street: The sex part came from the devil
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean maybe the word lust isn't the right one to use, maybe it is temporary satifaction of the bodied urges to keep man within the bound of rules within the bound of marraige and devotion to love, obviously i can't walk around with a boner all the time, are you saying wet dreams are unnatural, that would be like saying puberty is not real, masterbation gives a person the ability to control their body so they can naturally be a part of society
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] Keifer Street: Don't get me wrong.... though
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so sex for pleasure is evil?
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] Keifer Street: sex is NOT bad... only sex outside of the boundaries in which God made
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] Keifer Street: (namely marriage)
[02/08/2006 12:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: namely?
[02/08/2006 12:32 AM] Keifer Street: I am looking forward to having sex with my wife... and I WILL, MOST ASSUREDLY
[02/08/2006 12:32 AM] Keifer Street: get pleasure from it
[02/08/2006 12:32 AM] Keifer Street: lol
[02/08/2006 12:32 AM] Keifer Street: However, 
[02/08/2006 12:32 AM] Keifer Street: I don't lust, (or won't) after her in that way until I marry her
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] Keifer Street: God intended marriage to be extremely special and individual for both parties involved... which is why he designed it to be between a virgin man and a virgin woman
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then until i am married there is no one to commit adultery against, obviously god will be sitting there watching me, but i can'
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: t say i have ever been truely in love with another woman
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] Keifer Street: if you go 'whoring' yourself in your teenage years... you can never give your marriage pertner that gift which God meant... your virginity and purity
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] Keifer Street: but
[02/08/2006 12:33 AM] Keifer Street: If you have, there is still a hope
[02/08/2006 12:34 AM] Keifer Street: because...
[02/08/2006 12:34 AM] Keifer Street: you still have choices
[02/08/2006 12:34 AM] Keifer Street: God meant true love to be between a man and a woman... to be best friends, or partners in raising a family
[02/08/2006 12:35 AM] Keifer Street: You won't have ANY depth in a relationship in which sex (outside of marriage) is involved... there is no love... your eyes are blinded with lust
[02/08/2006 12:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and when it comes down to it, i'd probably never have sex with a woman outside of marriage for that really would be a sin; i agree. so although i may have lust for another woman now, eventually that will be replaced with love for another woman and i will stop, is it still a terrible sin up until that part or can i still use it to my advantage and to properly fit into public so that love between me and another woman could be made possible
[02/08/2006 12:35 AM] Keifer Street: True love... God's love... is far suprior and true
[02/08/2006 12:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so then i am a victim of lust and can't be blamed
[02/08/2006 12:36 AM] Keifer Street: Please, though Brian...
[02/08/2006 12:36 AM] Keifer Street: Don't try to justify your sin with logic
[02/08/2006 12:36 AM] Keifer Street: You know what is right
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] Keifer Street: You also know what you should do... because remember, you have a conscience that speaks to your heart
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] Keifer Street: First things first though....
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] Keifer Street: None of this will make a dime a difference if you are without the blood of Jesus...
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know what is right, but i also know what is necissary, i can't find the person i am to fall in love with if i can't go into public constantly worrying if i'm going to pop a boner in the middle of class
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] Keifer Street: Oh phewey
[02/08/2006 12:37 AM] Keifer Street: Mastrobation is NOT necessary
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] Keifer Street: neither is drugs, alchol, or smoking
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] Keifer Street: it is an ADDICTION
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] Keifer Street: and I can testify to that
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hm
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] Keifer Street: MASTROBATION is not required for your survival... you do not NEED it
[02/08/2006 12:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: interesting, i'll have to think about that more deeply
[02/08/2006 12:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: can i still download? i have nothing else to fill up this hard drive space and i've always been a collector. maybe i could sell it to jews they are already going to hell
[02/08/2006 12:40 AM] Keifer Street: Haha... 
[02/08/2006 12:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you think about the passion of the christ movie, do you think its a pretty reasonable representation of christ's time here on earth?
[02/08/2006 12:41 AM] Keifer Street: It's funny the things you ask me about are the hardest struggles, as a Christian, that I've ever faced... I've continually downloaded/deleted things because I wasn't sure if it was right... and kept telling myself stuff like... well... they make enough money... but then I thought
[02/08/2006 12:41 AM] Keifer Street: If you steal a dollar from a huge, corporate conglomorate, are you still a theif?

[02/08/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: she made it perfectly clear she didn't want to be sexually active, for a guy just starting college and me personally having a few one night stands (not sex, but everything up until) that statement could be pretty dissatisfying
[02/08/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but to tell you the truth
[02/08/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really feel like i will not be able to move on with love insterests if i don't give this relationship with her a chance
[02/08/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really believe that she IS the next one of the list, i'm not saying shes the last girl i'll ever date
[02/08/2006 01:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i'd never consider excluding that chance
[02/08/2006 01:06 AM] Keifer Street: Well... you seem like man of reason, right

[02/08/2006 01:08 AM] Keifer Street: Honestly, I would like to see nother better (and happier) than to two of you being saved,  and getting happily married

[02/08/2006 01:08 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we have different goals, i can never be posative that would happen, but if it is mean to happen somehow life will bring us together

[02/08/2006 01:12 AM] Keifer Street: If she is a Christian... I would say you better get saved tonight and call her up and tell her the good news... she would be very pleased, I'm sure (as would I by the way...)
[02/08/2006 01:12 AM] Keifer Street: I mean that's not a 'valid' reason for becoming a Christian
[02/08/2006 01:12 AM] Keifer Street: however,
[02/08/2006 01:12 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: to be honest at first i thought my attraction to her was a childhood fantasy, she wouldn't date me in middle school, she had boyfriends in high school but we never messed around, but after she told me she didn't want to be sexually active and i found myself still immensly attracted to her, i am not expecting to "get some" AT ALL, and i still want to be with her, i knew then that it is more then just a fantasy
[02/08/2006 01:13 AM] Keifer Street: I honestly think that if you both become Christians, that she really is the true love that God planned for you
[02/08/2006 01:13 AM] Keifer Street: But
[02/08/2006 01:13 AM] Keifer Street: I don't know much about that sort of thing in the 'grand scheme of things'
[02/08/2006 01:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't tell you that i will be saved tonight, i don't like the pressure, i don't think it would matter if i am tonight or maybe i will be when i go with you to a meeting and i can physically feel the power all around me, maybe it would happen then
[02/08/2006 01:17 AM] Keifer Street: Well... no pressure from me... but like I siad, there are no 'magic words' that you have to say... its you, God and that's it... talking... you may or may not feel a great 'whoosh' of power, but the bible says if you declare Christ as your King, that he PROMISES AND GUARANTEES your salvation
[02/08/2006 01:18 AM] Keifer Street: and eternal life
[02/08/2006 01:18 AM] Keifer Street: I will pray for you Brian, I pray that God opens your eyes, and your heart...
[02/08/2006 01:18 AM] Keifer Street: goodnight my friend
[02/08/2006 01:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: goodnight

[02/10/2006 04:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm not excited
[02/10/2006 04:59 PM] Keifer Street: Hmmm... well, I'm gonna go see if I can fix my camera.... when I turn it on it says "format required"
[02/10/2006 04:59 PM] Keifer Street: but after that, I'll help you
[02/10/2006 04:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol you don't have to help me clean
[02/10/2006 05:00 PM] Keifer Street: Well, if you want some advice... it is best to fire up the grill and let it heat up for about 5 minutes before you clean it... the fire heats up the bars and makes the stuff easier to clean
[02/10/2006 05:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we will need to clean twice
[02/10/2006 05:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you haven't seen the grill

[02/24/2006 07:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but on the site for raymond it says double occupancy instead of triple but on the floor layout and the room i saw it showed 1 bed and 1 bunk bed, so i am thinking there are 2 different style rooms that are really similar they don't list them separately, so logically it would give us priority to get a room there because we will be paying them more money for a third person

[03/05/2006 10:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: remember back when we discussed the intention of pictures weather or not they are intended to be stimulating and lead to sin determined weather or not they were art or porn
[03/05/2006 10:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you can't just apply that to one type of entertainment you apply that to every type, if a porno video is intended to be stimulating it should not be watched, if a movie is intended to be entertaining it can be watched.

[03/05/2006 10:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you said you wanted to do everything to avoid putting evil before your eyes.  if i was that radical, doing everything possible to avoid evil including never playing video games again, never watching TV again, and never watching movies again, and never listening to music again.
[03/05/2006 10:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because you can choose a full glass of cyanide or a drop, but you can also choose the size of the glass.  saying that you can't watch a movie because it has one seen that shows two people in love (making love being apart of being in love) it is no more radical to say you can't listen to rock because there is 1 song in the world with a sexual connotation, or not watching any movie because there might be a bad movie out there, or not watching any TV because there might be 1 bad show.  i am not going to try to avoid evil presented by other people because they cannot control me.  if i were to break down under a certain evil and do what peewee did and masturbate in a movie theatre because there is one erotic scene then i will receive justice from the law of the land and then avoid that type of evil, but that is completely irrational

[03/05/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: evil is all around, you think you may be avoiding it by keeping it off your computer, what is sinful is to allow that evil to become a part of you, to allow it to break the commandments, and to allow it to make yourself act evil.  a movie, and media, could very well lead you to evil, but when you refuse to allow it to affect you, you are doing exactly what jesus did in the desert, you are rejecting the evil, there was no way for jesus to completely prevent evil from happening, do you think he tried to stop satan from talking to him?
[03/05/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no all he did was reject the evil, when you watch a movie with sinful concepts in it because it's a good movie without them then just ignore what is evil don't completely avoid it, do what is christ-like and reject it, don't make a radical decision to shelter yourself from every single possibility.  to me it is better to control yourself and not allow evil into your life even when it is right in front of you.  just like committing a sin on purpose is like insulting jesus, rejecting evil even when presented with it every day is like punching satan in the face

[03/05/2006 11:40 PM] Keifer Street: The intentions of the makers are IRRELEVANT to whether or not you should watch something
[03/05/2006 11:41 PM] Keifer Street: You judge something by its 'fruits' or content
[03/06/2006 08:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how about its as simple as this, if it will lead you to sin and you recognize that its bad, then don't watch it, if you just recognize that there is a bad part and you know it won't lead you to sin then there is no reason you can't just watch the rest of the movie and ignore the bad part

[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] Keifer Street: What is her e-mail address???
[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why?
[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] Keifer Street: Actually, I'm not quite sure

[03/09/2006 10:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: having fun writing e-mails?
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: does she have MSN too?
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Keifer Street: No, I talked to her over Messenger
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Keifer Street: yeppers
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cool
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Keifer Street: look at her e-mail doofus...lol
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Keifer Street: @hotmail...
[03/09/2006 10:56 PM] Keifer Street: Keifer says: 
Hey, I know you might be a little distraught or confused about this whole 'Amy' thing... but I do honestly think that Brian really likes you 
~*-Christina-*~ says: 
i know he does 
~*-Christina-*~ says: 
he admitted it to me the other day 
~*-Christina-*~ says: 
he pretty much said if it wasn't for him being commited he would ask me out 
Keifer says: 
I simply think that the timing is wrong a
[03/09/2006 10:56 PM] Keifer Street: Keifer says: 
I simply think that the timing is wrong and he is forced to oblige to Amy because she travlled so far to see him over Spring Break... man... I wouldn't like to be in his shoes... ... but personally, I'd pick you   
~*-Christina-*~ says: 
thx, i appreciate that
[03/09/2006 10:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thanks man
[03/09/2006 10:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my heart is cut in half, i don't want to break either of theirs
[03/09/2006 10:57 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah, I know how you feel
[03/09/2006 10:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know either way it will be ok
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i just need time to think about it
[03/09/2006 10:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know amy really likes me, but i just want to make sure we both didn't make the mistake of jumping into something we didn't mean to
[03/09/2006 11:00 PM] Keifer Street: Well... she did travel really far just for you... I might hold off on telling her the 'Christina' bit for a little while
[03/09/2006 11:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[03/09/2006 11:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but its not the traveling thing
[03/09/2006 11:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i basically just said hey do you want to come visit me in AZ
[03/09/2006 11:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we will just have to let this play out
[03/09/2006 11:01 PM] Keifer Street: Well, try to have fun with Amy, and then seriouslly think and make an un-biased decision based upon their personalities
[03/09/2006 11:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the problem is, Amy is completely committed, i don't think she wants another boyfriend, i don't think she wants an "after me" at all.  I am afraid she is expecting to much, see you and I are different, you found your lover and plan to marry her, but for me i can't do that, i have to be sure there isn't a better match
[03/09/2006 11:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I HAVE TO BE SURE
[03/09/2006 11:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: much emphesis on that 
[03/09/2006 11:03 PM] Keifer Street: Just choose which one you find more 1)physically attractive 2)fun-loving 3) things in common and 4) peronality
[03/09/2006 11:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah then christina has already won based on those 4 things
[03/09/2006 11:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm not going to decide now, its to soon
[03/09/2006 11:04 PM] Keifer Street: Really?  How will you know unless you hang out with her?
[03/09/2006 11:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need to spend more time with Amy in person
[03/09/2006 11:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok when you list fun loving, christina is way more playful, but that might mean Amy is more mature, with things in common, there are two main parts of my life, computers and band, i have devoted most of my life to both of those activities, christina has band in common, Amy has neither
[03/09/2006 11:06 PM] Keifer Street: Hmm.... Well, reserve your judgements until after the break
[03/09/2006 11:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: definitely
[03/09/2006 11:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: thanks man for all the support
[03/09/2006 11:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really appreciate you being there for me, and i hope you expect the same from me
[03/09/2006 11:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you and sara EVER get into a big argument and you think you need a middle man to help find a happy median, don't ever hesitate to ask
[03/09/2006 11:10 PM] Keifer Street: haha

[03/09/2006 11:20 PM] Keifer Street: ~*-Christina-*~ says:

[03/09/2006 11:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what!?

[03/09/2006 11:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't think they are that great, and my haircut looks gay, i hope it grows back soon
[03/09/2006 11:26 PM] Keifer Street: ~*-Christina-*~ says: 
But seriouslly, don't tell Brian, but he would look sexy with a mustache and/or beard
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no more games

[04/13/2006 07:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its because she thinks your pretty
[04/13/2006 07:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and she told me not to tell you
