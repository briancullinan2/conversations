[03/12/2006 02:44 PM] Christina Sanders: awww :$
[03/12/2006 02:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how is lauren feeling?
[03/12/2006 02:45 PM] Christina Sanders: good... she has been out and about, she just got a head cold
[03/12/2006 02:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i'm not really feeling it yet
[03/12/2006 02:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to jack another pillow with 300 thread count pillow cover from my house so when i come back from spring break you can spend the night again
[03/12/2006 02:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its so hard to share a pillow, they just don't come long enough
[03/12/2006 02:48 PM] Christina Sanders: well i do have a body pillow
[03/12/2006 02:48 PM] Christina Sanders: if that counts
[03/12/2006 02:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i guess that would be long enough
[03/12/2006 02:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my dad has a bunch of those, i always sleep between when i am staying at his house
[03/12/2006 02:49 PM] Christina Sanders: i have one here and one at home 
[03/12/2006 02:49 PM] Christina Sanders: and when i am at home i seriously have a posse of pillows on my bed i sleep with
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol wow
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] Christina Sanders: you could say i am a pillow whore....
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] Christina Sanders: lol
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol i guess that why we could sleep much the other night
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] Christina Sanders: no kidding
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and because everything you do turns me on might add to the problem of trying to sleep
[03/12/2006 02:50 PM] Christina Sanders: hee hee
[03/12/2006 02:51 PM] Christina Sanders: it was so interesting though because i would fall asleep in your arms and while i slept all i could think or dream about was being in your arms
[03/12/2006 02:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol awww that's cute
[03/12/2006 02:51 PM] Christina Sanders: it's true though
[03/12/2006 02:52 PM] Christina Sanders: :)
[03/12/2006 02:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: all i thought about was holding you close to me
[03/12/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i think i slept more then i thought, because we only made out like twice and that was probably for an hour or so and we were awake at like 10
[03/12/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so there are lots of other hours
[03/12/2006 02:53 PM] Christina Sanders: isn't it funny how time flies so fast when you are making out
[03/12/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol yeah
[03/12/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or having fun

[03/12/2006 03:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how do i surprise you?
[03/12/2006 03:43 PM] Christina Sanders: well as i get to know you more (this might sound horrible) but i realize that there is so much inside of you that amazes me
[03/12/2006 03:44 PM] Christina Sanders: there is more to you than the computer geek
[03/12/2006 03:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you mean you're surprised i know so much about computers AND have a personality?
[03/12/2006 03:44 PM] Christina Sanders: ummm yeah......

[03/12/2006 03:45 PM] Christina Sanders: well...
[03/12/2006 03:45 PM] Christina Sanders: what i mean is
[03/12/2006 03:46 PM] Christina Sanders: i have friend back home who is a total computer geek and he does a life outside of computers but he is total jerk and inconsiderate (especially girls) and i sorta had this sterotype in my head that computer geeks were jerks and no personality
[03/12/2006 03:46 PM] Christina Sanders: then i met you
[03/12/2006 03:46 PM] Christina Sanders: i know that sounds really really really bad

[03/12/2006 03:47 PM] Christina Sanders: well i am attracted to more than your personality
[03/12/2006 03:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are some computer geeks that think they are all smart and all knowing, and the thing for me is, i always want to learn MORE, like i want to know everything, but i learn as much from everyone as i possibly can
[03/12/2006 03:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but you were right to think some computer geeks are jerks, it happens
[03/12/2006 03:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: some nerds trade their social lives for their nerd lives and don't know how to live in society and treat people, its quite sad actually
[03/12/2006 03:49 PM] Christina Sanders: i know
[03/12/2006 03:50 PM] Christina Sanders: i am glad i caught one that is the exceptionallity

[03/12/2006 03:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll stop talking so you can do that and maybe by 5 we can hang out?

[03/13/2006 11:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oops
[03/13/2006 11:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: totally mistake

[03/13/2006 11:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am totally falling for you, i have never hooked up with a girl so fast, i know we really have something special
[03/13/2006 11:40 PM] Christina Sanders: i have never clicked with someone as well as you and i
[03/13/2006 11:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't wait until after spring break when i am free of all obligations and we can just be together
[03/13/2006 11:40 PM] Christina Sanders: yes i know i know
[03/13/2006 11:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and further digressing on your question earlier, i wouldn't consider it cheating because i really don't want to be involved with Amy, the only reason i am delaying tell her is because it would be even more awkward if she was upset the entire time
[03/13/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah i understand
[03/13/2006 11:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i promise you i am completely focused on you, i have always been friends with Amy, and that's how it will remain
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you finish your powerpoint?
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: not yet
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you fight with your roomie?
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: i needed to talk to someone so i went to talk to my friend liz
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: no we didn't fight
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: needed to talk to someone?
[03/13/2006 11:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: are you ok?
[03/13/2006 11:45 PM] Christina Sanders: oh i am fine
[03/13/2006 11:45 PM] Christina Sanders: i just needed to talk to liz, about you and me, and i needed someone to vent to
[03/13/2006 11:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really? is it something i did?
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: no... no!!!!!!!!!
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: she didn't know aobut us
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: and she walked by the room
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: and i was sitting on you....
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: she wanted to know the story
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[03/13/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: and i needed to have some roomate venting time
[03/13/2006 11:47 PM] Christina Sanders: and i got to my friends nancie and liz when i need to vent
[03/13/2006 11:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok just making sure, i know how awkward this is, its completely different for me to, and i never meant for it to happen like this, if i had met you 3 weeks ago, we wouldn't have this problem, but it will all work out
[03/13/2006 11:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok well maybe we should maybe take it back a notch around your roommate
[03/13/2006 11:48 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah.... i think so, but we can talk about it when we are alone together
[03/13/2006 11:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, i really don't think Eric will mind if you stay the night, but i really wish we could be alone more often
[03/13/2006 11:50 PM] Christina Sanders: i know
[03/13/2006 11:50 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i'm not going to try to get you to ditch any important meetings

[03/15/2006 04:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: look i want to say a few things
[03/15/2006 04:06 PM] Christina Sanders: go ahead
[03/15/2006 04:06 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really though about whats going on
[03/15/2006 04:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i really want to make our relationship work and i know we can if we just try to get over this bump in the road
[03/15/2006 04:07 PM] Christina Sanders: uh huh
[03/15/2006 04:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i know that this is not the way i should be treating you, and i hope afterwards you can forgive me
[03/15/2006 04:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am the one that made the mistake
[03/15/2006 04:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not you
[03/15/2006 04:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i want you to tell everyone you have talked to about us just that
[03/15/2006 04:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and if they have a problem with it please tell them to talk to me about because you are paying for something i did
[03/15/2006 04:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what i could have done, the right thing to do, was told Amy i didn't think it would work out the day we kissed, and i let it go on too long
[03/15/2006 04:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now people think you are an accomplice to my mistake
[03/15/2006 04:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you mean a lot to me, more then i could ever say, and i want you to always be completely honest with me, you don't deserve to have people look down on you for what i did, if you are having second thoughts and want to back out of this, please tell me, i have an incredible attraction to you, but i would feel worse if you had to sacrifice a relationship with your friends because of me
[03/15/2006 04:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i could not describe the remorse i would feel if i let this relationship go bad because of a stupid little mistake like bad timing
[03/15/2006 04:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i would feel worse if i ever hurt you
[03/15/2006 04:14 PM] Christina Sanders: I am really scared right now, I am not sure what to do.... I mean I have had other relationships, but nothing like this, heck my first "real" relationship was over the phone...  but what i am trying to say is that I am so clueless what to do.... I want to stay on good terms with my friends, but theres a point where maybe this will tell me who my friends are and who aren't
[03/15/2006 04:14 PM] Christina Sanders: i really want this to work out too, I just don't know what to do
[03/15/2006 04:14 PM] Christina Sanders: I am attracted to you as well and I don't want to break your heart either or get my heart broken again
[03/15/2006 04:14 PM] Christina Sanders: I am so confused
[03/15/2006 04:14 PM] Christina Sanders: but all i know is that everytime I am with you, my day gets so much better
[03/15/2006 04:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then think of this, if i didn't have a relationship with Amy how would you feel?
[03/15/2006 04:16 PM] Christina Sanders: much better, but still afraid of rushing into it to fast and lost the fire and magic of the relationship  too soon
[03/15/2006 04:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you think that is what is happening?
[03/15/2006 04:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you think we are moving to fast?
[03/15/2006 04:16 PM] Christina Sanders: yes and no
[03/15/2006 04:17 PM] Christina Sanders: well all i am afraid of is losing the magic of our relationshipp
[03/15/2006 04:18 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well, do you think it is going to die tomorrow?  or do you think that this is what is killing it?
[03/15/2006 04:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i don't know
[03/15/2006 04:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i don't think this is killing this relationship

[03/15/2006 04:21 PM] Christina Sanders: i think i have trillian figured out finally
[03/15/2006 04:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I think that only time can tell what will happen, i wish i could see the future and tell you how long we will be together
[03/15/2006 04:21 PM] Christina Sanders: well lemme just say this so i can get it off my chest
[03/15/2006 04:22 PM] Christina Sanders: the reason why i am afraid of our relationship falling apart / losing the magic is because that's what happend between ryan and i and I hated it
[03/15/2006 04:22 PM] Christina Sanders: I hated the deadness of the realtionship
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: and I don't want that to happen with you because i like you too much
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the only thing i know for certain is that it feels good now, it feels good to have someone to wrap your arms around, someone you can love and trust and be with and never get sick of
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: exactly
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: i guess that i have fallen for you too
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you still enjoy being around him afterwards?
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: and i don't want it to end
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: oh i do
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: he is my friend
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so he kind of lost interest in you?
[03/15/2006 04:23 PM] Christina Sanders: we just didn't have a chance in the relationship point of view
[03/15/2006 04:24 PM] Christina Sanders: well he just got sick and tired of not being able to be with me so he gave up
[03/15/2006 04:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or you both kind of ended up "being together" but not really having fun?
[03/15/2006 04:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: was he the phone relationship?
[03/15/2006 04:24 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah he was the phone relationship
[03/15/2006 04:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well i promise you i will never be tired of being with you
[03/15/2006 04:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: as long as we are together i will have a passion for you
[03/15/2006 04:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so the rest, is up to you
[03/15/2006 04:26 PM] Christina Sanders: well as long as you promise never to let go of me....
[03/15/2006 04:26 PM] Christina Sanders: physically, mentally, emotionally
[03/15/2006 04:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i promise
[03/15/2006 04:26 PM] Christina Sanders: then i am yours
[03/15/2006 04:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would not worry about your friend that thinks your naughty
[03/15/2006 04:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what instant messenger does he use?
[03/15/2006 04:27 PM] Christina Sanders: aim
[03/15/2006 04:27 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tell him to talk to me
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: k, i do my best
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: but it seems kinda wierd
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: because i already know what he might say
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tell him i am the one he should be talking to because i am the one at fault
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i can explain it better
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: sure have your "boyfriend" defend you

[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: i will tell him
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] Christina Sanders: i just can't talk to him right now
[03/15/2006 04:28 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't care what he says if he wants the truth he should go to the source

[03/15/2006 04:46 PM] Christina Sanders: i'll just make a point of crying in front of you next time so i can wipe my eyes on your shirt
[03/15/2006 04:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was telling Tony about this the other night, and i asked him what he thought about you, and he said to me "i am not going to support you in anyway" and when i thought about it i remembered all the times he and Eric went out to eat without me, and every time he came into our room without even talking to me because he just wanted to play games, and i realized hes not really that great of friend and his oppinion doesn't matter to me
[03/15/2006 04:48 PM] Christina Sanders: who is tony?
[03/15/2006 04:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will promise to never cause you to cry ever again

[03/15/2006 04:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: someone we met last semester
[03/15/2006 04:48 PM] Christina Sanders: oh okay
[03/15/2006 04:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when i thought about it, i knew there was nothing he could say to me that would hurt my feelings for you
[03/15/2006 04:50 PM] Christina Sanders: well on my side the general consensous is that i might be taking it a little fast
[03/15/2006 04:51 PM] Christina Sanders: i agree, but not too worried about it anymore because i know that if I feel uncomfortable, you would stopp in a second
[03/15/2006 04:51 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: of course
[03/15/2006 04:51 PM] Christina Sanders: and the farthest i am going for now is kissing

[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you don't have to decide that now
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] Christina Sanders: :)
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but if your feelings are that strong, that is wonderful
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] Christina Sanders: well as i said i take time
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it is reassuring that our relationship will last a long time
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is fine
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i should take more time
[03/19/2006 10:32 PM] Christina Sanders: i just want to establish a trust

[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] Christina Sanders: and are hard to remove
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: of course
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] Christina Sanders: heck that's what happened with ryan and i
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would not want that to happen
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] Christina Sanders: he fell for me first i took time
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] Christina Sanders: then when the relationship ended he got over me
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] Christina Sanders: and it took me 3 months
[03/19/2006 10:34 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that is very sad
[03/19/2006 10:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that's another thing we have in common
[03/19/2006 10:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i feel a good story coming on
[03/19/2006 10:35 PM] Christina Sanders: oh.....
[03/19/2006 10:35 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my first girlfriend in high school dumped me 3 days before valentines day
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i had relatives flying out and i was so excited to introduce her
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we have already made plans to go out to eat
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] Christina Sanders: :(
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *had
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] Christina Sanders: :(
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was so excited, i could prove to her how much she meant to me
[03/19/2006 10:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: when she broke it off, she did it in a note, but she also told me before i read it
[03/19/2006 10:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: look back at it later i thought about giving the note back to her and telling her to wait until after our date
[03/19/2006 10:37 PM] Christina Sanders: what a witch
[03/19/2006 10:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i am glad i didn't though, i mean then i wouldn't have been able to spend valentines day like i spend every other valentines day, ALONE
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: hey i know how that feels
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: every vday
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: watching all my friends make plans and send eachother flowers
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: i hated it
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i thought i was getting over it pretty quick, i didn't see her in a few days and i never cried
[03/19/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: i always was left out
[03/19/2006 10:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah valentines day sucks, people don't even know why it exists, its not a happy story
[03/19/2006 10:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but when my new ex-girlfriend came back to school and i saw what a wreck she was in, i got sick
[03/19/2006 10:39 PM] Christina Sanders: :(
[03/19/2006 10:39 PM] Christina Sanders: oh wow
[03/19/2006 10:39 PM] Christina Sanders: such a happy story
[03/19/2006 10:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but time went by and i eventually got over it
[03/19/2006 10:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: until the band trip
[03/19/2006 10:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it gets better
[03/19/2006 10:40 PM] Christina Sanders: uh oh
[03/19/2006 10:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my best friend for 3 years at the time, started talking and becoming friends with my ex-girlfriend
[03/19/2006 10:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i kept reminding him that she was mine first, and he got angry with me because "he just wanted to be friends and didn't need me reminding him of that every time they were together"
[03/19/2006 10:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so on the trip they flirted infront of me
[03/19/2006 10:41 PM] Christina Sanders: uhoh
[03/19/2006 10:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my ex-girlfriend and her friend sat behind us every single day on the bus
[03/19/2006 10:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it was so annoying
[03/19/2006 10:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: one day a bus broke down and we all had to pile onto one so our director told us to try and fit 3 people in a seat and sit on each others laps
[03/19/2006 10:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and of course my ex-girlfriend sat on my best friends lap
[03/19/2006 10:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it was absolutely terrible
[03/19/2006 10:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but time went on
[03/19/2006 10:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i was less then broken hearted, we argued online, i always initiated a friendly conversation and she always finished it hatefully

[03/22/2006 01:55 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if you think your friends would disapprove, maybe its not such a good idea

[03/22/2006 01:56 AM] Christina Sanders: and not worry about when i got to get back to my room
[03/22/2006 01:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know, just do what you feel is right, i'll have the extra pillow with me if you do :-D

[03/22/2006 01:58 AM] Christina Sanders: i just feel awkward with your roommate being there
[03/22/2006 01:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: eh we have stuff in the middle, its not like he can look over and see us, besides, it would be mostly sleeping, not such much making out as last time, just because we both have class
[03/22/2006 02:00 AM] Christina Sanders: true
[03/22/2006 02:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and with my big comforter i usually feel quick secluded from him, its strange

[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: :D
[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: i think so
[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i admit, we did move kind of fast physically
[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but the thing is for guys its not so much we just want the physical part
[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its just reversed from what girls want
[03/29/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: girls want the mental and emotional part first
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: i have to say i have always wanted the physical part
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and guy what the physical part, and then afterwards the on going mental relationship
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: but i experienced a relationship where it was all about the physical
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: and i hated that
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i am sure we can find a happy medium
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: well we were only attracted physically and no other way
[03/29/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: i think we can find a happy medium too
[03/29/2006 01:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes well i have as well, but i guess the reason why i let us move a little fast physically is because when i find someone right i get attached pretty quickly
[03/29/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: i can tell
[03/29/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: ;)
[03/29/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: brb i need to brush my teeth and wash my little facwe
[03/29/2006 01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but it will all work out
[03/29/2006 01:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because our relationship is very strong on all mediums, its something i haven't had for a while, which makes me all the more confident that there is really something good between us
[03/29/2006 01:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *good and long lasting
[03/29/2006 01:44 AM] Christina Sanders: i am just happy you are attracted to me other than physically
[03/29/2006 01:44 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: of course
[03/29/2006 01:45 AM] Christina Sanders: and that you are attracted to me emotionally the most

[03/30/2006 10:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is it that you are applying for again?
[03/30/2006 10:51 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is it a scholarship outside of school?
[03/30/2006 10:52 AM] Christina Sanders: and then my dad was saying that my future at nau depends on if i get this letter
[03/30/2006 10:52 AM] Christina Sanders: this scholarship is the yavapai county education endowment

[03/30/2006 10:53 AM] Christina Sanders: and this scholarship is the main reason i am at nau and not at community college in cottonwood
[03/30/2006 10:53 AM] Christina Sanders: well i have called the lady multiple times today and she won't be in until i am in class
[03/30/2006 10:54 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what about after class?

[03/30/2006 10:55 AM] Christina Sanders: education bldg first then physical science next
[03/30/2006 10:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how about i meet you outside and you can use my cell phone to call and ask for an extension
[03/30/2006 10:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then after class you can go to your teacher and ask for a letter
[03/30/2006 10:56 AM] Christina Sanders: i don't know this teacher at all!
[03/30/2006 10:56 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and if you can't fax it tomorrow, i can easily drive you down there before 5
[03/30/2006 10:57 AM] Christina Sanders: the only reason my dad is making me is because i got an a in that class
[03/30/2006 10:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's ok, i'm sure the teacher has been asked for a more tedious task
[03/30/2006 10:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you still have his website you could find his office hours
[03/30/2006 10:58 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is the name of the teacher?
[03/30/2006 10:58 AM] Christina Sanders: well i have another idea
[03/30/2006 10:58 AM] Christina Sanders: that teacher is sylvester allred
[03/30/2006 10:59 AM] Christina Sanders: but i am thinking of asking my lab instructor for bio... bethany tropp her and i got along really well
[03/30/2006 10:59 AM] Christina Sanders: so maybe....
[03/30/2006 10:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see you have options, might as well ask them both, asking for something like this never hurt, i don't think they could both turn you down, then you will have an extra one for next year
[03/30/2006 11:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you will be ok, now where is the ed building so i can meet you?

[04/03/2006 03:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: besides that's just evidence that there is still that fire between us
[04/03/2006 03:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll be honest, i was nervous going into this relationship because i really liked you, and the first time you spent the night i didn't want it to turn out like those other relationships where i didn't enjoy being with you afterwards.  but when i still felt the growing need to be around you after that first night, i can't even describe the happiness i felt, i finally found someone that i really wanted to be with.  like i explained before i am very picky, mostly when it comes to finding someone i get along with
[04/03/2006 03:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am crazy about you
[04/03/2006 03:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and therefore i respect everything you share with me physically
[04/03/2006 03:56 PM] Christina Sanders: :) well i can honestly say i have had relationships where i was wanting to be with the guy so much but with you I need to be near you, i need and have to be in your arms
[04/03/2006 03:56 PM] Christina Sanders: i feel protected, alive and free to be myslef around you
[04/03/2006 03:56 PM] Christina Sanders: and i really enjoy that
[04/03/2006 03:57 PM] Christina Sanders: and love having someone who can handle all of me
[04/03/2006 03:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am glad, i really enjoy you, i've never felt this close to someone in a relationship either
[04/03/2006 03:58 PM] Christina Sanders: i feel i can tell anything to you and i don't get reactions etc from you like others
[04/03/2006 03:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i enjoy everything about you, and i want to know everything about your life

Session Start (b.cullinan@cox.net:Christina Sanders): Sun May 21 00:56:51 2006
[05/21/2006 12:56 AM] Christina Sanders: gah
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: stupid msn
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: anyways
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: anyways
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: i really miss you
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: like alot
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i really miss you too
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: here's my e-mail
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the start of it
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: k
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll keep typing but you can't say anything
[05/21/2006 12:57 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: I thought a lot about what you said.  I am glad you said it.  At first I felt like instead of putting this relationship on hold between second and third base you were trying to back track it to first.  At first it hurt, and felt like there was regret, which can be very bad for a relationship, but then I realized that those were not your intentions.  And instead you just wanted to bring out the better and more important parts of this relationship.  I am glad you told me how you were feeling.  Now I guess it is my turn.
[05/21/2006 12:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: to be honest, i prayed.  I prayed that god would let you know that i am not angry or regretful or doubtful of what you said, and that i still love you.  I prayed that he would tell me you still love me, and there was no regret for the things we have done.  and i prayed that i would be able to better communicate my feelings.
[05/21/2006 12:59 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i decided to write this e-mail
[05/21/2006 01:00 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess the reason that i provoked doing these things, being playful in bed and all, is because i am afraid.
[05/21/2006 01:01 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am afraid of what people have told me, i am afraid of how people act in movies, and i'm afraid of what i see if my parents.  i am afraid of having a shitty sex life, is what it comes down to.  i am afraid that when i am old enough to get married and finally have sex, that it will have worn down and would be boring and wouldn't be playful or experimental or anything
[05/21/2006 01:02 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'm not suggesting that i would have sex before marriage, i am just saying the reason i do these things is because i'm hoping to keep it up, keep the feeling alive, because it feels wonderful
[05/21/2006 01:03 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am afraid that after marriage i won't have a beautiful brunet girl sitting on top of my topless leaning down to kiss me and her crazy hair going everywhere.  i am afraid it will be dull, and only for making babies
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i guess i shouldn't worry about it, because it a long ways off, and my spouse and i will deal with it when we get there
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so you are right
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we should take more time
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and take it easy
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and just enjoy each other
[05/21/2006 01:04 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not because of what we do in bed
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so there it is
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: my side of the story
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] Christina Sanders: wow
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i hope i didn't scare you off already
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: *sigh*
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] Christina Sanders: i love you so much
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] Christina Sanders: and even more so
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] Christina Sanders: i am glad you told me that
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: * thanks goodness*
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] Christina Sanders: really
[05/21/2006 01:05 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i love you too
[05/21/2006 01:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: praying helps
[05/21/2006 01:06 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2006 01:06 AM] Christina Sanders: oh yeah it does
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: prayer was my lifeline this past year
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now you understand all of my sexual frustration?
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: yes i do
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: okay
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: now it is my turn
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: i ihave something to tell you
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok
[05/21/2006 01:07 AM] Christina Sanders: and i don't want you to interject
[05/21/2006 01:08 AM] Christina Sanders: the main reason i brought all of this up was because I was afriad that we were starting to get to the point of our relationship only being physical
[05/21/2006 01:09 AM] Christina Sanders: the last few times you made me orgasm to be honest i didn't really enjoy it until the actual orgasm but i didn't say anything because i could tell that you enjoued it as well and i didn't want to cause a confliict at all and i want you to be happy
[05/21/2006 01:09 AM] Christina Sanders: so that is why the last few nights i fell asleep
[05/21/2006 01:09 AM] Christina Sanders: without anuthing
[05/21/2006 01:10 AM] Christina Sanders: i wanted to prove to myself that i could spend the night with you and it not involve any physical stuff other than cuddling and kissing
[05/21/2006 01:10 AM] Christina Sanders: but in the end i ended up hurting you more than anything
[05/21/2006 01:10 AM] Christina Sanders: i had been wanting to say this too u but i didn't know how to
[05/21/2006 01:10 AM] Christina Sanders: luckily today at the wedding
[05/21/2006 01:11 AM] Christina Sanders: the big thing that they said was that the couple stayed pure in every aspect of their life to the best of their abilities
[05/21/2006 01:11 AM] Christina Sanders: and i realized i wanted that to be said about me at my wedding
[05/21/2006 01:11 AM] Christina Sanders: and i wanted my relationship to revolve around what God wanted for me and you and not what i wanted
[05/21/2006 01:12 AM] Christina Sanders: and seeing my mom freak out over the hickey
[05/21/2006 01:12 AM] Christina Sanders: i wouldn't want her to know what else i have done
[05/21/2006 01:12 AM] Christina Sanders: and even though i enjoued all of it with you
[05/21/2006 01:12 AM] Christina Sanders: i feel ashamed
[05/21/2006 01:13 AM] Christina Sanders: i have acted way out of character this semster (but you, that was a good thing, you were good, this pertains more to my school stuff)
[05/21/2006 01:13 AM] Christina Sanders: and i want to get back on track to where i waws
[05/21/2006 01:13 AM] Christina Sanders: followinig god more than ii have
[05/21/2006 01:13 AM] Christina Sanders: i believe that the thing that trigged alot of this was not going to church
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] Christina Sanders: and next year i am goinig to find one that i feel comftorable with
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] Christina Sanders: because i need God more than anythinig
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] Christina Sanders: and without him, i will not go the right way at all
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] Christina Sanders: so anyways there is my "email"
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] Christina Sanders: i am done
[05/21/2006 01:14 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i will be there by your side to support you
[05/21/2006 01:15 AM] Christina Sanders: i knew i got a keeper when i found you
[05/21/2006 01:15 AM] Christina Sanders: i love you
[05/21/2006 01:15 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i love you
[05/21/2006 01:15 AM] Christina Sanders: and i want to be with you because you have been there for me and i truly believe that we were meant to be together
[05/21/2006 01:15 AM] Christina Sanders: and i say that from our relationship these past 2 months
[05/21/2006 01:17 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i know our relationship is strong, i trusted myself not to take the physical part too far, but i must admit there was a lot of temptation, and i might not have been able to handle it, but knew that it would be ok because we had those two months together, and now we have to spend to apart
[05/21/2006 01:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i guess i wasn't to worried how far the physical part went, because we would be forced to be apart from each other
[05/21/2006 01:18 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:18 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and could develop the other parts of our relationship
[05/21/2006 01:19 AM] Christina Sanders: well this is sorta off aliittle but something you should know
[05/21/2006 01:19 AM] Christina Sanders: i am really worried about next semester
[05/21/2006 01:19 AM] Christina Sanders: because since i got that d my parents want me to retake my special ed class
[05/21/2006 01:19 AM] Christina Sanders: and i am taking it next semester
[05/21/2006 01:19 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: maybe i just got too used to getting in your pants, that i let my guard down, and we both got a little off track
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: and not dropping any classes I will be taking 17 credit hours
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: just so you know
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's a lot
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah we did both get a little used to it
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: i think i can handle it
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we will get through it together
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: and i needed it
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will help you focus on school
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: all those classes will force me to pay attention and do my work
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: thx
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: i think you should at least take one more class
[05/21/2006 01:20 AM] Christina Sanders: PLEASE!!!!!!
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why?
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will be working during the school year
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] Christina Sanders: i know
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will stay on task because i will be busy
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] Christina Sanders: but if we end up together
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] Christina Sanders: i don't really want to have to be all alone teaching while i wait for you to graduate
[05/21/2006 01:21 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2006 01:22 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'll be fine

[05/21/2006 01:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tomorrow?
[05/21/2006 01:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what time?
[05/21/2006 01:23 AM] Christina Sanders: i fly out at 2 tomorrow
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] Christina Sanders: i would have to be at the airport like noon
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] Christina Sanders: isih
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you have your boarding pass?
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: any bags to check?
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] Christina Sanders: only one
[05/21/2006 01:24 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so we would still have to wait in line i hate checking bags
[05/21/2006 01:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will be up by 10:30 ish
[05/21/2006 01:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: call me around then just in case
[05/21/2006 01:25 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even if they say no, call me before you leave your house to say goodbye
[05/21/2006 01:25 AM] Christina Sanders: i will
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i still can't believe your mom freaked about the hickey
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its really not that big of deal
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] Christina Sanders: she was like.. you aren't being pure!!
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even while staying pure
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] Christina Sanders: i was like ITS JUST A HICKEY!!!!!
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] Christina Sanders: on the neck
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] Christina Sanders: as a joke
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its just a hickey
[05/21/2006 01:26 AM] Christina Sanders: for his mom
[05/21/2006 01:27 AM] Christina Sanders: but i didn't tell her that you did it to freka out your mom because she was freaking out
[05/21/2006 01:27 AM] Christina Sanders: and i couldn't get it out
[05/21/2006 01:27 AM] Christina Sanders: oh well
[05/21/2006 01:27 AM] Christina Sanders: at least it is over
[05/21/2006 01:27 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so what exactly do you consider being pure?
[05/21/2006 01:28 AM] Christina Sanders: i dunno
[05/21/2006 01:28 AM] Christina Sanders: well not having sex is a bigge
[05/21/2006 01:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because it sounds to me like it means nothing we have done together
[05/21/2006 01:28 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean that would be pure
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess we could just forget about it all, or pretend it never happened
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: well i do think the orgasm stuff wasn't exactly sainthood stuff
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that never ends well
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: well i was just gonna have it a thing in the past
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: and not bring it up
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah but still
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: i am not lying about it
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] Christina Sanders: or pretending it isn't happening
[05/21/2006 01:29 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i can't help but think about you
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: i am just not gonna vocalize about it
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: same here
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: i wish you werei in bed with me
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: in my queen sized bed
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] Christina Sanders: with a crapload of pillows
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that would be nice
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that's not pure either
[05/21/2006 01:30 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: according to your parents
[05/21/2006 01:31 AM] Christina Sanders: well i am thinking my mom thinks hickeys are something you do while having sex and only then
[05/21/2006 01:31 AM] Christina Sanders: and i seriuosly think that is why she said that
[05/21/2006 01:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well i hope so
[05/21/2006 01:31 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because then she would be wrong
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would never go against what your parents say
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: well seriiously i am just not gonna talk about it and keep it to myself
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: thx
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well between you and me
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: don't keep it to yourself
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] Christina Sanders: thats what i meant
[05/21/2006 01:32 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because then there will be that void that keeps filling up with everything we don't say to each other
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: purity has a lot to do with intention
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and only god knows your true intention
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah true true
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] Christina Sanders: when i meant myself i meant us
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] Christina Sanders: sry
[05/21/2006 01:33 AM] Christina Sanders: i meant not tellinig others who don't need to know
[05/21/2006 01:34 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so while your mother thinks my intention for giving you that hickey what you have sex with you, my intention was merely only to amuse you, but now i guess it is doing more harm
[05/21/2006 01:34 AM] Christina Sanders: well i did telll her the story why it happened
[05/21/2006 01:34 AM] Christina Sanders: and she then seemed to let up on me about it
[05/21/2006 01:35 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i could say the same about everything we have done, like my intention for getting you off was to make you feel good, but i don't think it works in that case, and we should both ask forgiveness
[05/21/2006 01:35 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah i agree
[05/21/2006 01:35 AM] Christina Sanders: i actually have prayed for forgiveness for what i have done
[05/21/2006 01:36 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have too
[05/21/2006 01:36 AM] Christina Sanders: but i also pray that we stay together and become what God wants us to be as a couple
[05/21/2006 01:36 AM] Christina Sanders: i also have asked for the strength to say no to you
[05/21/2006 01:36 AM] Christina Sanders: which is hard
[05/21/2006 01:36 AM] Christina Sanders: because ii want you to be happy
[05/21/2006 01:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wish i could put my balls in cryostasis for later use
[05/21/2006 01:37 AM] Christina Sanders: haa haa
[05/21/2006 01:37 AM] Christina Sanders: wow
[05/21/2006 01:37 AM] Christina Sanders: that was random
[05/21/2006 01:37 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: believe me, i have prayed for help dealing with it
[05/21/2006 01:38 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it doesn't feel good, so i try to take care of it myself, but then i still doesn't feel good
[05/21/2006 01:38 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:38 AM] Christina Sanders: i do have to say it has been interesting you have your needs but i can't meet those needs without doing things i am not ready for
[05/21/2006 01:39 AM] Christina Sanders: aka sex
[05/21/2006 01:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: nah, i wouldn't let you go that far, there are alternatives, but it is still not pure
[05/21/2006 01:39 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what a terrible flaw in the design
[05/21/2006 01:40 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: if guys don't get off, it hurts.  if guys get off the wrong way or before marriage, it hurts.
[05/21/2006 01:40 AM] Christina Sanders: oh wow
[05/21/2006 01:40 AM] Christina Sanders: hah i like being a girl
[05/21/2006 01:40 AM] Christina Sanders: lol
[05/21/2006 01:40 AM] Christina Sanders: i wont be mean anymore
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] Christina Sanders: i am sorry you have to go through that
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] Christina Sanders: i hate it because i can't help you at all
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: blue ball probably feels like a period
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then getting off hurts emotionally
[05/21/2006 01:41 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: really
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: i didn't know that
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah, because its against gods will
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not pure
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not fair
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: oh hurts that way
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: ahh
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: i know what you mean now
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: hey at least you don't experience child birth!!!
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: lol
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: especially if porn is used as "assistance"
[05/21/2006 01:42 AM] Christina Sanders: ill be nice
[05/21/2006 01:43 AM] Christina Sanders: i hate how the world is
[05/21/2006 01:43 AM] Christina Sanders: gah
[05/21/2006 01:43 AM] Christina Sanders: why is everything revolved around sex and making yourself feel good
[05/21/2006 01:43 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the bible is very specific, to even look at a woman with lust is to commit adultery in your heart
[05/21/2006 01:43 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so if a guy gets off, it still hurts
[05/21/2006 01:44 AM] Christina Sanders: oh wow
[05/21/2006 01:44 AM] Christina Sanders: i am really glad that we are talking about this because to be honest, i ihad no clue where you stood on this issue and with GOD as well
[05/21/2006 01:44 AM] Christina Sanders: so ii am really happy like alot
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] Christina Sanders: to hear you say this
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not about making yourself feel good necessarily, its more a habit
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i am trying to break it
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] Christina Sanders: samehere
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but that still does change the physical pain that must be dealt with
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:45 AM] Christina Sanders: pain is temporary God is forever
[05/21/2006 01:46 AM] Christina Sanders: hee hee i ilike that one alot
[05/21/2006 01:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[05/21/2006 01:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i started speculating
[05/21/2006 01:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what if one were to concentrate only on the wonderful feeling
[05/21/2006 01:46 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and not think about another person with lust
[05/21/2006 01:47 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess that would be the only good solution, or i could just be full of shit and trying to justify my sin like most sinners do
[05/21/2006 01:47 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah well that's excatly what it was
[05/21/2006 01:47 AM] Christina Sanders: i fell into that shit as well
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i don't know, its a hard topic
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] Christina Sanders: it is
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] Christina Sanders: because we want to follow our human instinct
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i do know that once i am married i would like to practice tantra
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] Christina Sanders: and not what god wants us to follow
[05/21/2006 01:48 AM] Christina Sanders: tantra?
[05/21/2006 01:49 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it not only teaches to expand the orgasm, but also completely rids to person of the animalistic instinct, and teaches the person to focus all the sexual energy on the emotional attachment to their partner
[05/21/2006 01:49 AM] Christina Sanders: oh wow
[05/21/2006 01:50 AM] Christina Sanders: interesting
[05/21/2006 01:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[05/21/2006 01:50 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: tantra.com
