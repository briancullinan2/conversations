BrianJCullinan: well?
BrianJCullinan: i thought you needed help?
PUREformOFaLOSER: ok we have a HD that wont come up
BrianJCullinan: who is this?
PUREformOFaLOSER: I tried pluggin it into my HD slot but all it does is stays at the beginniong.. the command prompt screen
PUREformOFaLOSER: seth
BrianJCullinan: do you have another harddrive?
BrianJCullinan: how did you start your computer before?
PUREformOFaLOSER: yes
PUREformOFaLOSER: no its not my HD its my friends
BrianJCullinan: ok
PUREformOFaLOSER: i am trying to bring it up on my comp
BrianJCullinan: and you want to boot from his harddrive?
PUREformOFaLOSER: yes
BrianJCullinan: did you change the BIOS?
PUREformOFaLOSER: no
BrianJCullinan: did you make it slave or master?
PUREformOFaLOSER: both
PUREformOFaLOSER: we tried it on both
PUREformOFaLOSER: slave it comes up and says operating system not found
PUREformOFaLOSER: master it just fricken bleeps at me with its little curser
BrianJCullinan: you need to change your friends hard drive to master, and your other hard drive to slave
PUREformOFaLOSER: gotcha
PUREformOFaLOSER: ill try that
BrianJCullinan: then the master hard drive needs to be connected to the cable 1 slot on your mother board, so you will probably have to reconnect those
BrianJCullinan: unless you have a cord that can put two hard drives on to one, then it doesn't matter
