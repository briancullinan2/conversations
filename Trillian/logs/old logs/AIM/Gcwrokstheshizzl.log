 Where's the pills that cure that thing that you call "sweeping me off my feet"?  
 It's girls like you that keep open graves for boys like me, that keep themselves locked up for days 
 Behind these bedroom walls, every night I sing along with all her favorite songs.  
 I sing until my voice is gone, until my lungs are bleedin'.  
 Tell me you don't miss these brown eyes and that you're not in love.  
 Take this stupid heart,  
 I know it's all you ever wanted me for

[04/08/2004 12:31 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: well zach doesnt want a commitment like he doesnt want a relationship which i like. and drew...well i actually like dreww and i dont get tired of him. i want to be with him all the time 
[04/08/2004 12:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you would rather not have commitment because you're afraid of it?
[04/08/2004 12:32 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: ya 
[04/08/2004 12:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you know this is a very hard age in every persons life
[04/08/2004 12:33 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: it is?

[04/08/2004 12:34 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: ehh 
[04/08/2004 12:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: so it might be hard to tell if someone is or isn't committed to you already, because it could change like the rest of that person
[04/08/2004 12:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe eventually you'll give commitment another chance
[04/08/2004 12:34 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: I dunno 
[04/08/2004 12:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: you just shouldn't ruin your body by doing drugs in the mean time
[04/08/2004 12:36 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: eh yeah i know 
[04/08/2004 12:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should let it out when things are going well
[04/08/2004 12:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: tell someone, tell me, i don't mind, if that is the difference between doing and not doing drugs
[04/08/2004 12:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: tell yur mom to stop giving you shit about those things and just let it go
[04/08/2004 12:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: let hannah worry about you, shes not going to be the only one
[04/08/2004 12:37 PM] Gcwrokstheshizzl: i cant.it is so hard for me to try and show emotion bcuz i just never have
