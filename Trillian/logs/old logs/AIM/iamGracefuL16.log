LittlePNutss: theres you, i'd go ou with you, but i like being your friend
LittlePNutss: nd then there is another girl in band
LittlePNutss: but shes too young for me
LittlePNutss: at least i'm mature enough to admit she is too young
iamGracefuL16: is she a freshman?
LittlePNutss: hey what a guess
LittlePNutss: yup
iamGracefuL16: it's not that saxophone player is it?
LittlePNutss: she looks skanky
LittlePNutss: no
iamGracefuL16: flute player?
LittlePNutss: yup
iamGracefuL16: hm..... well there's Eric, Brianna and that other one
iamGracefuL16: which one is it?
LittlePNutss: Brianna
LittlePNutss: Shes really pretty
iamGracefuL16: have u talked to her a lot?
LittlePNutss: and hasn't been polluted with all the evils of high school
LittlePNutss: i've talked to her before
LittlePNutss: but she hardly talked back
iamGracefuL16: young and innocent minds.....
iamGracefuL16: she seems slightly shy
iamGracefuL16: who else do you like?
LittlePNutss: what do you mean slightly
iamGracefuL16: I dunno, I haven't talked to her
LittlePNutss: there are some other girls who i just think are really pretty but haven't talked to before
iamGracefuL16: well of course, everyone does that
LittlePNutss: i need a girlfriend
iamGracefuL16: why do you need one?
LittlePNutss: cuz girls are fun
LittlePNutss: keep things interesting
iamGracefuL16: true, but what happens if you break up with her, and never speak to her again/
iamGracefuL16: ?
LittlePNutss: then things are more interesting
LittlePNutss: and i try to get her back
iamGracefuL16: what if you dumped her?
LittlePNutss: i wouldn't go out with her if I was going to dump her
iamGracefuL16: true, but people change
iamGracefuL16: except in my parents' case, but that's a different story......
LittlePNutss: mine to
LittlePNutss: anywho
LittlePNutss: i would let the girl decide where she wants to go with a relationship
iamGracefuL16: that's good
LittlePNutss: on any subject, weather its kissing, or dating, or what movie she wants to see
LittlePNutss: it would be completely up to her, i'm pretty passive when it comes to that
iamGracefuL16: yeah, but if she was a gf, she'd let you make some decisions too
iamGracefuL16: *a good gf
LittlePNutss: yeah sure, it would be a mutual decision
LittlePNutss: but depending on what it is, i'd go with what she wants
LittlePNutss: i'd want to make her happy
iamGracefuL16: that's cool
LittlePNutss: and she'd want to be with me
LittlePNutss: but i would have to find someone i trust
LittlePNutss: and really like
iamGracefuL16: so, just curious, you don't have to answer if you don't want to, but how many gfs have you had?
LittlePNutss: because then i could trust that she would make the best decision
LittlePNutss: based on our common intrests perhaps
iamGracefuL16: trust is important
LittlePNutss: its very important
iamGracefuL16: yeah, but relationships are still a lot of work
LittlePNutss: nah
LittlePNutss: they are fun
LittlePNutss: we are good at it
iamGracefuL16: wait, what?
LittlePNutss: i would like talking to my gf on the phone and such
LittlePNutss: everyone is good at relationships, we have formed relationships since the day we were born
iamGracefuL16: true
iamGracefuL16: but those sort of relationships are a bit different
LittlePNutss: and the only expences are ocasional dates
LittlePNutss: the boyfriend/ girlfriend relationship is only an extension
LittlePNutss: being more then just friends
iamGracefuL16: wow, sounds like you've given all this some thought
LittlePNutss: definatly
iamGracefuL16: I just go with the flow
LittlePNutss: yeah and i would to
iamGracefuL16: wherever the relationship goes is what's probably meant to happen
LittlePNutss: you can do that in a datin relationship
LittlePNutss: exactly
LittlePNutss: thats why they aren't too much work
iamGracefuL16: yeah, I guess
LittlePNutss: i highly dissagree with people who think they are
iamGracefuL16: really?
iamGracefuL16: have you been in one before?
LittlePNutss: relationships would be so much easier and more fun if everyone expressed themselves
iamGracefuL16: guys have a hard time with that thogh
iamGracefuL16: *though
LittlePNutss: the most important part of a relationship is communication, and if that doesn't happen then it wasn't meant to be
LittlePNutss: yeah some guys
iamGracefuL16: a lot of them
LittlePNutss: but if i found a girlfriend i knew and trusted i'd always tell her how i feel
LittlePNutss: and i would expect the same from her
LittlePNutss: no secrets!
iamGracefuL16: wow, you really do have all that planned out
LittlePNutss: i hope so
LittlePNutss: someday it might work
LittlePNutss: i might find someone i'm meant to be with and it will last forever
iamGracefuL16: I'm sure you will
LittlePNutss: i hope so
LittlePNutss: and you will find someone too
iamGracefuL16: yay, there is hope
LittlePNutss: your a good person, and good people deserve love
iamGracefuL16: well, so r u

BrianJCullinan: i don't know, there just happens to be this thing in the world called money

iamGracefuL16: I'm good, how r u?
BrianJCullinan: i'm not sure
iamGracefuL16: why aren't you sure?
BrianJCullinan: *immatating Mika's russain accent* i'm indefferent
iamGracefuL16: well, Micah should speak, he stuck someone's monkey down his pants on the bus

iamGracefuL16: wow, I can't type today
iamGracefuL16: sry about that
iamGracefuL16: O:-)
BrianJCullinan: see, there is this girl
BrianJCullinan: ....
iamGracefuL16: Breanaa
iamGracefuL16: Brianna, go on
BrianJCullinan: i took into consideration what you said
BrianJCullinan: Brianna
BrianJCullinan: yes
iamGracefuL16: what?
BrianJCullinan: about going to fast
iamGracefuL16: and what is your opinion?
BrianJCullinan: its just we get along great and i don't want to waste time
BrianJCullinan: but, you're right, i shouldn't push it
iamGracefuL16: well, mayb in ur case you don't have to wait
BrianJCullinan: and i'm trying not to
BrianJCullinan: lol your to slow
iamGracefuL16: there's no right or wrong answer, it's all opinion
BrianJCullinan: i suppose
BrianJCullinan: its just i've never had so much in common
iamGracefuL16: well, what do u guys have in common?
BrianJCullinan: when ever i've gone from really liking a girl, to not liking and moving on, there is always something that i look back on and really can't stand about her, but with Brianna, i'm trying to see her from all points of view, and i honestly can't find anything i don't like
iamGracefuL16: lol, just curious, what can't you stand about me?
BrianJCullinan: i guess the biggest thing we have in common is, we are both interested in computer work, and we are both interested in band
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: i was hoping you'd ask
iamGracefuL16: ::wondering if that's a good thing::
BrianJCullinan: there is nothing i don't like about you, only you're not very insterested in computer work
BrianJCullinan: hm, your pretty, your really nice, you can see, me
BrianJCullinan: thats the important things
iamGracefuL16: of course I can
iamGracefuL16: but just a hint, everybody feels invisible sometime
BrianJCullinan: but i never got enough time to get to know you, before you started talking to Andy  >:o
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan:  
BrianJCullinan:  
iamGracefuL16: lol, I knew Andy b4 u
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry
BrianJCullinan: how sad
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: j/k
BrianJCullinan: we make better friends anyways
BrianJCullinan: we will have to stay in touch
iamGracefuL16: yeah, cuz if we went out, and broke up, then I'd lose a funny guy friend
iamGracefuL16: who I like squirting with a water bottle
iamGracefuL16: :-DO:-)
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: well i think that if people are friends before going out, then they will be friends after going out
BrianJCullinan: but we were friends long enough before i liked you
iamGracefuL16: just curious, when did you start liking me?
BrianJCullinan: hm
BrianJCullinan: pretty soon after we met
BrianJCullinan: i think i liked a lot of people as long as they could see me
BrianJCullinan: but i thought you were pretty even before you and bradly broke up
iamGracefuL16: oh gosh, back then?  ewww... I still had like the frizzy hair going, I didn't even know how to control it, i was shy, insecure, and just starting to not be so shy
BrianJCullinan: then you could see me as opeque and i liked you
BrianJCullinan: your hair was different everyday
BrianJCullinan: but i'm glad we are friends
BrianJCullinan: your fun to bother, and write on with markers
BrianJCullinan: and next time i'm going to get your entire WHITE shirt all wet *grin*
iamGracefuL16: lol, yes markers r so much fun
iamGracefuL16: u wish
iamGracefuL16: u'll b the one completely soaked
iamGracefuL16: and with sharpie on ur face, hehe
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: shush
BrianJCullinan: yur goin' down

BrianJCullinan: oh yeah?
BrianJCullinan: well then
BrianJCullinan: hm
BrianJCullinan: *ponders*
BrianJCullinan: Andy huh?
BrianJCullinan: why?
BrianJCullinan: you really like him?
iamGracefuL16: I dunno, I just like him, it's weird, I've liked him since November
BrianJCullinan: i see
BrianJCullinan: you think hes hott?
iamGracefuL16: he's cute, I wouldn't say hot, cuz like nobody @ Pinnacle lives up to my high standards of hotness
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: thanks
BrianJCullinan: >:O
iamGracefuL16: what's that for?
BrianJCullinan: i'm not hott?
iamGracefuL16: well, would you like to hear MY definition of hot?
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: lets hear it
BrianJCullinan: i'll have something to work on
iamGracefuL16: ok, tall, muscular arms, mayb six pack (:-D)  blue eyes, blond or brown hair (doesn't matter), charming smile
BrianJCullinan: lol that counts me out
iamGracefuL16: that counts like every guy @ Pinnacle out, but there's a lot of good looking guys at Pinnacle
BrianJCullinan: yeah there are
BrianJCullinan: like me
iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: well, when you ask brianna out, I hope things work out for you guys, cuz she seems like a really sweet girl
BrianJCullinan: she is
BrianJCullinan: but i'm not gonna push it
BrianJCullinan: thanks so much for the supports
BrianJCullinan: you're such a great friend
iamGracefuL16: hey, no problem, hehe thankx you to!  you're one of those ppl I could tell a lot of things to, and your funny, so that's a bonus
iamGracefuL16: so, just curious (can u tell I'm a curious lil person 2night) when do you think u'll ask Brianna out?
BrianJCullinan: maybe by friday
BrianJCullinan: but i might wait
BrianJCullinan: gots to see how things go
BrianJCullinan: she called me
BrianJCullinan: shes calling me back from her house
iamGracefuL16: OoOoOhhhh how sweet
BrianJCullinan: since her dad won't let her online
iamGracefuL16: they're so cute at this age
BrianJCullinan: yeah she is
iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: well, let me know b4 u ask her out, I want to hide behind the corner
iamGracefuL16: not literally
iamGracefuL16: but I want to know how it goes
BrianJCullinan: ok
iamGracefuL16: cuz it bugs me when ppl know things I don't, that's an issue of mine
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: i'm talking to her
iamGracefuL16: on the phone
iamGracefuL16: ?
BrianJCullinan: yup
iamGracefuL16: sry, this is a weird, question, but have you had a gf b4?  u don't have to answer if you don't want to
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: its ok
BrianJCullinan: i kind of have
iamGracefuL16: kinda?
BrianJCullinan: but it never went really far
BrianJCullinan: i've never been kissed
BrianJCullinan: how about you?
iamGracefuL16: well, I've still got my never been kissed title, but you know about the rest of my history
BrianJCullinan: good title
BrianJCullinan: it means a lot
iamGracefuL16: yeah, I want it to be special, something I remember
BrianJCullinan: and
BrianJCullinan: it means a lot to the person
BrianJCullinan: afterwards you can tell them it was your first kiss
BrianJCullinan: and think of how they would feel
BrianJCullinan: so special

iamGracefuL16: heyya
iamGracefuL16: hehe
BrianJCullinan: oh
iamGracefuL16: don't mind me, I'm being confusing tday
iamGracefuL16: *today
BrianJCullinan: *tear* no responce to my e-mail yet
iamGracefuL16: who'd u email?
BrianJCullinan: her
BrianJCullinan: now that i'm home i don't know what to do
iamGracefuL16: yeah same
iamGracefuL16: today wasn't worth my time
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: boring
BrianJCullinan: hmmm i'm thinking i might work on my flash card program
iamGracefuL16: lol, I'm trying to figure out how I'm ever gonna finish this stupid mind game
BrianJCullinan: mind game?
iamGracefuL16: Minesweeper, I beat it at Beginner and Intermediate, but I can't beat it at Expert
BrianJCullinan: lol
iamGracefuL16: and because I can't, it bugs me, so every day I try and beat it
iamGracefuL16: but I got 11 seconds on Beginner, which is not too shabby
iamGracefuL16: lol, I realized today that urs names go 2gether...... BRIAN   BRIANna  hehe, isn't that cool?
BrianJCullinan: she noticed that too
BrianJCullinan: our screennames are also the same length
BrianJCullinan: and she always hangs around Erika, and i'm always around Eric
iamGracefuL16: ooohhh Twilight Zone.......
iamGracefuL16: so, do you know if she has a crush on u?
BrianJCullinan: i think there is something there
iamGracefuL16: I'm guessing so
BrianJCullinan: we hug eachother
iamGracefuL16: how cute, it's like your going out already
BrianJCullinan: but today i really felt something when i hugged her
BrianJCullinan: well i hope we soon will be
iamGracefuL16: oh, that's so sweet
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't think a hug is a big deal, and its not, its only showing affection for someone else, it doesn't mean you have to like eachother more then friends
BrianJCullinan: but i think we do like eachother a lot
iamGracefuL16: that's good, see, I'm not a hugging person, not really for anybody except certain special exceptions
BrianJCullinan: thats ok
BrianJCullinan: i like hugging people
iamGracefuL16: lol, like Andrew
iamGracefuL16: does
BrianJCullinan: yeah but he hugs everyone
BrianJCullinan: so does cindy
BrianJCullinan: i only like hugging people i really like
BrianJCullinan: girls mostly
iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: ya know, you should create a profile
iamGracefuL16: you have no info
BrianJCullinan: i know
iamGracefuL16: oh there u are, 50 minutes l8r, hehe jk
BrianJCullinan: i have the second and third song memorized
iamGracefuL16: that's awesome, I worked on the 3rd last night
iamGracefuL16: the 2nd song took me forever to get the counting down, I had my dad work with me on it
BrianJCullinan: lol haha
BrianJCullinan: yes weight curls are good
BrianJCullinan: i'm sexersizing
iamGracefuL16: huh?
iamGracefuL16: your lifting weights?
BrianJCullinan: weight curls
iamGracefuL16: as in bicep curls?
BrianJCullinan: you don't really need a gym to do weight curls
iamGracefuL16: yeah, I have a gym in my room
BrianJCullinan: i use 15lb weights and usually do 100 of them
BrianJCullinan: i'm not very strong
BrianJCullinan: not yet
iamGracefuL16: well, if ur looking to build muscle, you should use heavier weights, and  do 6-8 repititions 2-3 times
BrianJCullinan: it depends
iamGracefuL16: right now, all ur doing is toning muscle, so that's fine if your not looking to build it
BrianJCullinan: using a lighter weight and doing more curls makes the muscle grow longer, and using heavy weights doing a few at a time makes the muscle grow taller
BrianJCullinan: so i think i'm in the right place
iamGracefuL16: you want longer muscles?  I thought guys were into having some
iamGracefuL16: actual muscles
BrianJCullinan: no i use 15 pounds, its not too light
BrianJCullinan: but i do a lot of them
BrianJCullinan: so i like the way my muscles are forming now
BrianJCullinan: i just have to keep exersizing
iamGracefuL16: hey whatever works, I like to build muscle, so I do it a different way
BrianJCullinan: i see
BrianJCullinan: what weight do you use?
iamGracefuL16: for bicep curls I use 12,  but I also like to do leg extensions, bench press, lat pulls, tricep kickbacks, calf raises, butterfly, seated rows, all the basic stuff
BrianJCullinan: lol yeah.....
iamGracefuL16: weighttraining it fun stuff
iamGracefuL16: *is
BrianJCullinan: i think i'll stick with running from people that want to kick my ass, weight curls, situps, and pushups
iamGracefuL16: lol, that works
iamGracefuL16: that's my weakness runnin
iamGracefuL16: g
iamGracefuL16: I suck at it so bad
BrianJCullinan: no fancy names
BrianJCullinan: lol
iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: well, I have all that crap in my room
iamGracefuL16: might as well use it
iamGracefuL16: plus a treadmill
BrianJCullinan: i like running, but i can only do it when i want to show off or someone is chasing me
iamGracefuL16: I suck at it, my endurance is so horrible it's embarasssing
BrianJCullinan: like at band camp i ran with Cale one day, only around the field thought not very far, and people chase me on occasion and i can stay away from them
iamGracefuL16: ur lucky
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: i messed up my muscle the week before school after band camp
iamGracefuL16: leg, arm? which one?

BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't like youngin's

BrianJCullinan: she was just not having a good day
iamGracefuL16: well, we're coming back tomorrow, and I'm giving her a second chance
iamGracefuL16: I had a shitty day to, and I didn't need her to add to it
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't like young people
BrianJCullinan: or freshmen
BrianJCullinan: and i don't blame her
iamGracefuL16: y not?
BrianJCullinan: there crabby
BrianJCullinan: and they think they own the place
iamGracefuL16: we're crabby?  look at her......
BrianJCullinan: her and i have been there for 3 years and we don't need anymore lower classman shit
BrianJCullinan: we've had enough already from the upperclassmen
iamGracefuL16: well, I don't give u any
BrianJCullinan: i know
BrianJCullinan: but obviously people give it to her
iamGracefuL16: so, i'd appreciate it if she didn't take everything out on us for what our stupid class did
BrianJCullinan: and maybe instead of finding ways to challenge her temper you should try to avoid it, wouldn't that be an idea?
iamGracefuL16: that means avoiding Andrew
iamGracefuL16: and I'm not going to plan according to her
BrianJCullinan: yeah if you want me to say something to her i can
iamGracefuL16: no, don't worry about it
BrianJCullinan: but don't get all bad ass attitude towards her just because she burst, everyone does sometimes
iamGracefuL16: Andrew told us to still come over tomorrow
iamGracefuL16: I'm not, I'm giving her a second chance tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: its not a chane
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't care weather you like her or not
iamGracefuL16: and I don't care either, until u treat my friends like shit, then I care
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't care if she made Katie angry, the only one thats going to make a difference is andrew and even then, she has a problem with andrew being bipolar too
iamGracefuL16: well, Katie wasn't angry, I was angry
BrianJCullinan: ok
iamGracefuL16: but like I said, I had a shitty day too
BrianJCullinan: yeah me too
BrianJCullinan: must have been the weather

BrianJCullinan: the general population of people are stupid

iamGracefuL16: good
iamGracefuL16: u know, if we had known that she was upset and needed to talk to Andrew, we wouldn't have bothered her in the first place
BrianJCullinan: well i can agree with her
BrianJCullinan: you guys go over there and mess with andrew
iamGracefuL16: mess with him?  he tells us to come visit him?

BrianJCullinan: well they are the ones that deserved what she said, not you guys, sorry if that what it came across as
iamGracefuL16: well, u agreed with her
BrianJCullinan: i agreed that you guys go ovetr and mess around, not that she should have been mean about telling you to leave
iamGracefuL16: u mean she should have told us in a more polite way to stay away from her and Andrew?
BrianJCullinan: sure
BrianJCullinan: then told chris and becca never to come back
BrianJCullinan: she just wanted a conversation

BrianJCullinan: j/k
BrianJCullinan: do you ever hang out with him?

iamGracefuL16: what do u mean?
BrianJCullinan: have you gone to movies together?
BrianJCullinan: or just hung out at one of your houses
BrianJCullinan: ?
iamGracefuL16: no, he just comes over to my house, we watched LOTR 2 on Sunday
BrianJCullinan: good movie
BrianJCullinan: and he doesn't put his arm around you?

BrianJCullinan: lol oOo
BrianJCullinan: sounds like you could be a fun girlfriend
iamGracefuL16: is that sarcasm?
BrianJCullinan: get one of his friends to say something
BrianJCullinan: no not sarcastic
iamGracefuL16: I don't know any of his friends, except like Micah
BrianJCullinan: lol any girl that gets impatient when they aren't getting the right attention is a good one for a relationship
BrianJCullinan: means it will last a long time, they won't let it end
iamGracefuL16: that's good.... I guess.... anywho, how r things with u and Brianna?
BrianJCullinan: Brianna on the other hand, she never says anything, and i think there is an urge to be with me but sometimes it's hard to tell
iamGracefuL16: what do u mean she never says anything?
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't talk much in person, and she doesn't put her arm around me when i do, her.  but i know she wants to be with me, she just won't say it in person
BrianJCullinan: i'm her first boyfriend
BrianJCullinan: it will take a while
iamGracefuL16: yeah, u have to be patient
iamGracefuL16: it's weird.....
BrianJCullinan: i am trying
iamGracefuL16: like since Andy and I have been going out, we talk a lot more, conversation is easier
iamGracefuL16: give it some time
BrianJCullinan: yeah i know
BrianJCullinan: i'm the impatient one
iamGracefuL16: guys usually are
iamGracefuL16: is she allowed to go places with u, like the movies?
BrianJCullinan: oh well, i can wait i suppose, we are getting closer
BrianJCullinan: i'm not sure
BrianJCullinan: i think i will wait until after friday night when i meet her mom to bring that up again
BrianJCullinan: i have plans to make a really great impression
iamGracefuL16: bring it up again?  did u already bring it up?
BrianJCullinan: well i told her to ask, and her mom keeps saying "we need to have a 'talk'"
iamGracefuL16: like u and her need to have a talk, all three of u, or just her and her mom?
BrianJCullinan: and Brianna tells me about these "talks" and i don't like them
BrianJCullinan: her and her mom
BrianJCullinan: talk
iamGracefuL16: does Brianna have a good relationship with her mom?
BrianJCullinan: i need a second opinion on these "talk" because from what Brianna has told me, her mom isn't too eager to let her date
BrianJCullinan: i think so
BrianJCullinan: and when she comes back and tells me, i don't like what she says
iamGracefuL16: well, she's so young though
iamGracefuL16: what does she say?
BrianJCullinan: well i don't know if i should tell you, her mom sure wouldn't like me telling people what she said, she didn't even want Brianna to tell me
BrianJCullinan: i guess you would probably be the best person to ask though since you seem like you were brought up right (i only use seem, because i honestly don't know very much about you)
BrianJCullinan: they're just little things, her mom has told her "guys are only after one thing"
iamGracefuL16: lol!!!  sounds like Claire's mom
BrianJCullinan: brb need to find it in the convo.
iamGracefuL16: hehe, I got that lecture from her mom, and I'm not even her daughter
BrianJCullinan: but that isn't true!  that's terribly insulting
iamGracefuL16: I know, it's a stereotype
BrianJCullinan: and a terrible one to tell a daughter
iamGracefuL16: and it probably sux to have such a bad stereotype
iamGracefuL16: my mom is like that but not as bad
iamGracefuL16: cuz she went out with a senior as a freshman, so I'm like easier to raise than she probably was
BrianJCullinan: ok she also said 
 yes, and guys at 16 and 17 r always thinking about sex..
BrianJCullinan: what a terrible thing to say
BrianJCullinan: maybe sometimes, but not always!
iamGracefuL16: well, I heard some crazy statistic that the average teenage guy thinks about sex every 5 seconds or something
BrianJCullinan: and
 "they will beg u!"
BrianJCullinan: i will not
BrianJCullinan: thats mean
BrianJCullinan: i take much offence to that
iamGracefuL16: I know, ur one of the guys who I think wouldn't pressure a girl to do something like that
BrianJCullinan: i know
iamGracefuL16: just, maybe she'll change her mind after meeting u
BrianJCullinan: ok so maybe i thought about taking it a little furthur, but if the time actually came when i was in that type of situation i would tell her 'no, we can't'
BrianJCullinan: i hope he does
BrianJCullinan: *she
iamGracefuL16: yeah, cuz uh.... I doubt u want to wind up with a pregnant gf or something
BrianJCullinan: lol yeah nasty
iamGracefuL16: well, that's good, all I can say is give it time, and her parents will start to trust you
BrianJCullinan: i can't even support myself, how would i be able to support a baby
iamGracefuL16: you couldn't probably
BrianJCullinan: i have enough $
BrianJCullinan: mMm $
iamGracefuL16: and think of ur gf!  that'd be a million times harder for her
BrianJCullinan: lol yeah
iamGracefuL16: like that's my worst fear, not dying, but getting raped and winding up pregnant
BrianJCullinan: that is scary
BrianJCullinan: i don't know much about it, but dying during pregnancy doesn't sound fun either
iamGracefuL16: yeah really!
BrianJCullinan: i'd shoot myself if i got a girl pregnant and she died from it
BrianJCullinan: seriously i'd kill myself
BrianJCullinan: i'd be so depressed
iamGracefuL16: I bet!
BrianJCullinan: and it would be all my fault
iamGracefuL16: oh well, we definitely have to finish this conversation another time, remind me, cuz I have to go!
BrianJCullinan: now you have me scared
iamGracefuL16: good, don't have sex, have a nice day!
BrianJCullinan: lol
iamGracefuL16: I'll ttyl!
BrianJCullinan: bye

iamGracefuL16: (Link: http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/alexhan)http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/alexhan
BrianJCullinan: thats why i asked, i was thinking about her, and i'm "hm i wonder how andrea and andy are"
iamGracefuL16: cool
BrianJCullinan: because last time we talked it seemed like you and Andy weren't going anywhere
BrianJCullinan: whats that site for?
iamGracefuL16: go look
BrianJCullinan: your role model?
iamGracefuL16: lol, no, but he has his own fricken CD!
BrianJCullinan: thats cool
BrianJCullinan: i looked
BrianJCullinan: he must be good
BrianJCullinan: did you listen to the songs?
iamGracefuL16: no I'm having a problem downloading them, I think my music running program needs to be upgraded
BrianJCullinan: it didn't work for me either
BrianJCullinan: something is wrong with the format
BrianJCullinan: don't bother with it
iamGracefuL16: yeah, I figured so, I think it worked for Eric though, he's the one who told me to listen to the songs
iamGracefuL16: anywho, I was trying to get suggestions from Eric for a song for solo ensemble
BrianJCullinan: will you be my acompniast?
BrianJCullinan: or how ever you spell it
iamGracefuL16: I dunno, let me see the music, cuz if I can't play it well, I won't play it for your sake
BrianJCullinan: lol
iamGracefuL16: I think I'm gonna have my piano teacher be mine
iamGracefuL16: she's the best one I could think of
BrianJCullinan: i wouldn't worry about it, it's easy for me, so i doubt it would be hard for you
BrianJCullinan: well you get half the points earned that i get if you acompany, i think, plus the points you get when you solo
iamGracefuL16: hey cool, Mrs. Earnest give the points?
iamGracefuL16: like letter pts?
BrianJCullinan: both letter points and judge points i think
iamGracefuL16: yay, I could use letter points
iamGracefuL16: I could care less if I get a participant rating on my solo
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: i don't care either
iamGracefuL16: piano is where I get my Superiors, O:-):-D
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to ditch district competition if they try and make me go
iamGracefuL16: heck if I made it I'd go
iamGracefuL16: then again, cows don't fly, so I probably won't
BrianJCullinan: lol
iamGracefuL16: but I'd like to try
iamGracefuL16: plus I'm doing Jazz Fest for piano in November
iamGracefuL16: and 2 levels of the study program in piano in April
BrianJCullinan: fun
iamGracefuL16: oh yes, and duet ensemble for piano

iamGracefuL16: kids and their shinanigans
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: conflabit...  hooligans they are
iamGracefuL16: lol!
iamGracefuL16: I might do chamber, if they need saxophones, is musical the thing where they didn't have saxophones/
iamGracefuL16: ?
BrianJCullinan: um not sure
BrianJCullinan: maybe it was chamber where they didn't have them
iamGracefuL16: mayb both, i can't remember
BrianJCullinan: either way you could play piano in either one
iamGracefuL16: yeah true
BrianJCullinan: they really need a pianist in the music

LittlePNutss: but i don't want to tell you
LittlePNutss: you'll be scared
iamGracefuL16: scared?  doubt it
iamGracefuL16: all guys r horny
LittlePNutss: i kept finding ways to sneak my hands up her shirt
iamGracefuL16: not surprised
LittlePNutss: but she was so warm and soft
LittlePNutss: it was irrasistable
LittlePNutss: i kept her warm to
iamGracefuL16: u need self control
LittlePNutss: lol yup
LittlePNutss: i have none
LittlePNutss: to bad people were there or we both would have been really naughty
LittlePNutss: but that wasn't the worst of my bad behavier
LittlePNutss: *sigh* i'm a horn dog, and i feel bad about it
iamGracefuL16: just control it
LittlePNutss: lol
LittlePNutss: well
LittlePNutss: she let me
LittlePNutss: she said it was ok
LittlePNutss: so i didn't feel bad at the time
iamGracefuL16: that's good, u don't want to piss her off
LittlePNutss: i know, i would have left her alone if she was mad
LittlePNutss: she was cuddly too
iamGracefuL16: that's good
LittlePNutss: she hung on me to, but was really cold
LittlePNutss: and i helped keep her warm
LittlePNutss: but i did worse
iamGracefuL16: how nice
LittlePNutss: so i was being flirty like that, then she took my wallet, and i said if she didn't give it back i'd get under her bra
LittlePNutss: is that worse then what goes on in the back of your bus?
iamGracefuL16: no
LittlePNutss: ok
LittlePNutss: is it still bad ?
iamGracefuL16: going out, not really, just watch where it leads you......
LittlePNutss: yeah i considered that
LittlePNutss: i keep thinking, its not going any further
LittlePNutss: all fun in games, and play is fun
LittlePNutss: but i can't let is go further
LittlePNutss: she said she didn't mind it, other then people being there
LittlePNutss: what did you do the whole time?
LittlePNutss: are you going to be in band next year/
LittlePNutss: ?
LittlePNutss: i hope you had fun
iamGracefuL16: of course I'll be in band next year
LittlePNutss: woo hoo!
LittlePNutss: yay

LittlePNutss: you're fun
LittlePNutss: you've changed
LittlePNutss: i thought you were prude
LittlePNutss: i use to
LittlePNutss: not any more
LittlePNutss: you're really cool
LittlePNutss: i wish i had more friends like you
iamGracefuL16: thankx
iamGracefuL16: hey, do u know Ashley West
iamGracefuL16: ?
LittlePNutss: yup

LittlePNutss: tell her i changed my e-mail next time she send you one, its not b.cullinan@cox.net
LittlePNutss: the . changed from j
LittlePNutss: to many junk mail
LittlePNutss: big mistake
LittlePNutss: long story
iamGracefuL16: I bet
iamGracefuL16: I get porn mail all the time
iamGracefuL16: it sux
LittlePNutss: good stuff
LittlePNutss: you like it?
iamGracefuL16: no
LittlePNutss: lol ok
LittlePNutss: i didn't think you would
LittlePNutss: so, what about you and Andy?
iamGracefuL16: what about us?
LittlePNutss: had he put his arm around you yet?
iamGracefuL16: yep
LittlePNutss: you enjoy his attention?
iamGracefuL16: yes
LittlePNutss: have you two kissed yet?  i know you shouldn't kiss and tell but you can trust me to repect that information
iamGracefuL16: ok
iamGracefuL16: no
LittlePNutss: do you want to?
iamGracefuL16: yes, but there's a place & a time
LittlePNutss: i mean the first kiss is supposed to be for someone you really really like, just make sure you want to give it to him
LittlePNutss: yes there is
LittlePNutss: but places and times change
iamGracefuL16: what do u mean?
LittlePNutss: i mean, how do you know where the right time and place it, if there is a spacific time and place then its not really a first kiss, or not a good one, it has to be completely unexpected
iamGracefuL16: yeah......
iamGracefuL16: but like in front of ppl's parents is not a good time
LittlePNutss: those are the best, whe neither of you can stand it any longer and just have to give it up to eachother
LittlePNutss: yeah definatly not a good time, but i hope you find the right time and place
iamGracefuL16: is that how urs happened?
iamGracefuL16: yeah me 2
LittlePNutss: i think you would enjoy it
LittlePNutss: mine?
LittlePNutss: wow
LittlePNutss: i could never forget that night
iamGracefuL16: I bet
LittlePNutss: want details?
LittlePNutss: could give you some ideas
iamGracefuL16: sure
iamGracefuL16: I won't tell
LittlePNutss: well i guess it happened that night, as opposed to any other night, because we had cuddled a lot, and we real close to eachother
iamGracefuL16: who made the move?
LittlePNutss: i don't know if it was to soon to kiss or if we should have done it sooner, but that didn't really matter
iamGracefuL16: was it at a football game?
LittlePNutss: we walked outside together and she was going to say good night, i was kind of expecting it, but i really wanted it
LittlePNutss: not i went to her house and we watched a movie together
iamGracefuL16: really?
iamGracefuL16: her parents let u?
LittlePNutss: it was probably a month ago
LittlePNutss: yeah, you said andy came to your house to watch movies
iamGracefuL16: only once did we watch a movie
iamGracefuL16: but he's come over dozens of times
LittlePNutss: ok well we did that, and this was the first time i went to her house actually
iamGracefuL16: were u nervous?
LittlePNutss: well i was, i don't really go to people houses
LittlePNutss: and i've never gone to someones house driving by myself
LittlePNutss: so yeah i was nervous
iamGracefuL16: have u guys gone on a date yet?
iamGracefuL16: U bet
iamGracefuL16: *I
LittlePNutss: yeah we went to see Kill Bill
LittlePNutss: but ANYWAS
iamGracefuL16: yay for u
LittlePNutss: we walked outside together, and i was really hoping we would kiss, but i didn't know if she wanted to (always let Andy know if you want to, make sure he knows because it's really hard on us) so we hugged and i wispered in her ear that i wanted to kiss her, and she kind of came on to me, we were close, and she kissed me, pretty unexpectedly
LittlePNutss: i thought it would just be a little peck, but it was a lot more
LittlePNutss: it was fun, and when i got home i learned how much she really really liked it
LittlePNutss: neither of us could explain how much we liked it, because we had never done it before
iamGracefuL16: was it both of ur first kisses?
LittlePNutss: so we both looked forward to it, and i found out later that she really really wanted to kiss me, and was going to die if she didn't that night, so that was a pretty encouraging thought
LittlePNutss: yup both our first
LittlePNutss: and i brought up the point that it's kind of a turn on to know that you turn someone else on
iamGracefuL16: aw... how cute
LittlePNutss: lol sounds confusing, i hope your experience is just as enjoyable, and you should look forward to it
LittlePNutss: be sure to tell me when it happens
iamGracefuL16: I will.... if it ever happens
iamGracefuL16: :-\
LittlePNutss: damnit, i just foung out i work 7:30 am to 4 pm tomorrow
LittlePNutss: *found
LittlePNutss: that makes me angry
iamGracefuL16: that's a long time
LittlePNutss: 8.5 hours
iamGracefuL16: ugh!
LittlePNutss: darnit, i wanted to enjoy this weekend
iamGracefuL16: sucks huh?
LittlePNutss: thats not going to happen
LittlePNutss: yeah i'd say
LittlePNutss: don't ever get a shity job when your old enough
LittlePNutss: make sure its one you like
LittlePNutss: and would sacrafice for
iamGracefuL16: I'm trying to find a career, it's hard, I don't know what to choose
iamGracefuL16: I need to look more into the ones I'm interested in
LittlePNutss: i turned my resolution way down on my computer
LittlePNutss: its really dark
LittlePNutss: oOo
iamGracefuL16: lol, so easily amused
LittlePNutss: yup
LittlePNutss: i have some business to attend to

iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: u r
LittlePNutss: good question
LittlePNutss: what is up with andtre
LittlePNutss: *andrew
LittlePNutss: i tried to tell him
iamGracefuL16: I have no idea
iamGracefuL16: tell him what?
LittlePNutss: he said he doesn't want to be best friends because we never talk
iamGracefuL16: do u guys talk?
LittlePNutss: so i don't understand what a best friend really is, and don't care, as long as we're friend
LittlePNutss: and i'd hve to blame the not talking on him
iamGracefuL16: how can u not understand what a best friend is?
LittlePNutss: i always try to talk to him and he ignores me, signs off on me, or i'm to busy to talk on the phone
iamGracefuL16: that's not kewl
LittlePNutss: who cares what a best friend it, why do you have to have a best friend, why does it matter?
LittlePNutss: i try to talk to him at school but he never responds because hes bipolar
iamGracefuL16: I couldn't live without my best friends
iamGracefuL16: !!!
 
LittlePNutss: so then you have more then one?
LittlePNutss: and why are they your best
LittlePNutss: ?
iamGracefuL16: Katie and Claire
iamGracefuL16: and they're best friends, cuz when I need someone they're always there, we can tell each other anything, we just have fun together I guess
iamGracefuL16: Annie is also a very good friend, but we don't hang out much
iamGracefuL16: don'
iamGracefuL16: t u have best friends like that?
LittlePNutss: well.... no
LittlePNutss: kind of
LittlePNutss: bridget is always there for me but we dont talk unless one of us has a problem
LittlePNutss: i talk to you a lot
iamGracefuL16: oh... I feel special now!
LittlePNutss: and i think i could trust you with anything
iamGracefuL16: yay
iamGracefuL16: jeez.... why must I have to keep everybody's secrets?
LittlePNutss: so i guess by your definition you're my best friend
iamGracefuL16: it's such a hard job
LittlePNutss: lol
iamGracefuL16: lol
LittlePNutss: i just called brianna
iamGracefuL16: fun stuff
LittlePNutss: she was at a party and i told her i would make her say , "i love you"
LittlePNutss: infront of her friends
LittlePNutss: very cruel i know
iamGracefuL16: lol, not really
iamGracefuL16: but ok
LittlePNutss: they were watching a funny show, but when i got her to say it louder i heard lots of laughing but it might of been from the show
iamGracefuL16: just..... be careful with those words
LittlePNutss: lol i love her as a friend
LittlePNutss: and as a person
iamGracefuL16: that's good
LittlePNutss: not someone i want to spend the rest of my life with, sure i'd be cool if that happened but i'm not planning on that right now
iamGracefuL16: yeah, that's a long ways away
LittlePNutss: and i've told her that, and she agrees
iamGracefuL16: I'm glad things are working out with u and Brianna
LittlePNutss: me to
LittlePNutss: and thank you
LittlePNutss: you're to nice to me
iamGracefuL16: I try to be nice to everyone, except a select 2
LittlePNutss: what if andy saw me hitting on you, he'd probably be mad
iamGracefuL16: well, more like one really
LittlePNutss: who?
iamGracefuL16: yeah especially the whole sucker thing
iamGracefuL16: I think he'd come after u
LittlePNutss: yeah probably
LittlePNutss: hes scary
iamGracefuL16: scary?
LittlePNutss: who arem't you nice to?
iamGracefuL16: oh Rebecac
iamGracefuL16: *Rebecca
iamGracefuL16: well I am
iamGracefuL16: but when I lose patience, I'm not so nice
LittlePNutss: i don't like her either
iamGracefuL16: but there's nobody I "hate"
iamGracefuL16: nobody does
LittlePNutss: thats sad
LittlePNutss: i wonder why
LittlePNutss: she can't be any more annoying then me
LittlePNutss: unless i'm missing something
iamGracefuL16: cuz she's a drama queen, she tries to hard, and she makes fun of ppl behidn they're back and acts like they're friends
iamGracefuL16: ur not annoying
iamGracefuL16: trust me
iamGracefuL16: Bradley is annoying
iamGracefuL16: ur nowhere near him
iamGracefuL16: "Suddenly, I'm feeling invisible....."
iamGracefuL16:          
iamGracefuL16:

iamGracefuL16:         
iamGracefuL16:      
iamGracefuL16:      
LittlePNutss: sorry
LittlePNutss: talking to my mommy
iamGracefuL16: lol
LittlePNutss: my mommy loves me more then you
iamGracefuL16: probably true
iamGracefuL16: my mommy loves me more than u
LittlePNutss: speaking of which, back to the topic of me saying it to Brianna, don't you think it would be more weird for me to be so close to her with kissing and everything we do, and NOT say it?
LittlePNutss: yeah but i still love you as a person, you're a good person, and a great friend
LittlePNutss: remember that one time i wanted to go out with you
iamGracefuL16: how could I forget
LittlePNutss: i still think we should go to a dance together, but not we both have someone special
iamGracefuL16: u didn't get a hug, and then u went off as fast as u had liked me
LittlePNutss: i bet i sounded creepy huh?
LittlePNutss: yeah i was a strange kid, i'm more suttle now i hope
iamGracefuL16: lol
iamGracefuL16: not really creepy.... plus I heard u had a crush on like practically every other girl in band
LittlePNutss: i don't want to say i was desparate because thats kind of insulting, but i just needed someone, and you're a pretty incredible girl, so it would have been a good time investment
LittlePNutss: no not every other girl, heather and ashley thats it
LittlePNutss: and jen
LittlePNutss: shes hot
iamGracefuL16: well, that's important
LittlePNutss: i mean just as a person and personality to shes just hot
LittlePNutss: wouldn't you agree
LittlePNutss: shes so much fun, she hot
iamGracefuL16: that she's hot?  I have no idea, cuz I don't know what guys standards for "hotness" are
LittlePNutss: i'm not talking about appearence i mean just the way she acts and how outgoing she is
LittlePNutss: it's hot
iamGracefuL16: ok.......?  sure
LittlePNutss: anyways
LittlePNutss: how about you
LittlePNutss: what guys did you like?
LittlePNutss: Andy?
LittlePNutss: Bradly?
LittlePNutss: you went out with him
LittlePNutss: that was scary
iamGracefuL16: ugh!
iamGracefuL16: u didn't even know me then
LittlePNutss: but since i saw you in the band room the first day i thought you were really pretty, and then i found out you were going out with bradly, and thought you were insane
iamGracefuL16: lol!!!
LittlePNutss: and you're tall!
iamGracefuL16: wow, I went from pretty to insane in 4 days
LittlePNutss: taller then him
iamGracefuL16: that's a BAD thing
LittlePNutss: yeah
LittlePNutss: i thought, "that poor girl"
iamGracefuL16: well think about it...... every freshman flute except Brianna went out with him
iamGracefuL16: they all made the same stupid mistake I did
iamGracefuL16: and I learned a TON from it
LittlePNutss: i should probably go to bed now
LittlePNutss: thats good that you learned from it
LittlePNutss: don't jump into relationships
LittlePNutss: right?
iamGracefuL16: definitely
LittlePNutss: i learned that to eventually
LittlePNutss: the hard way
iamGracefuL16: what do u mean?
LittlePNutss: instead of jumping into a relationship, i kept trying and failing
iamGracefuL16: eek
LittlePNutss: then it finally came to me, maybe i shouldn't be so eager
LittlePNutss: so thats when i learned to control myself
LittlePNutss: it really was getting out of hand for me
LittlePNutss: it would have been easier to just do it and then learn not to jump in so soon, but instead i kept getting the rejection from trying
LittlePNutss: very bad
LittlePNutss: i want to go to bed and talk to you at the same time
LittlePNutss: but can't
iamGracefuL16: lol, same!
LittlePNutss: and i should really go to bed
iamGracefuL16: yeah, u have to get up so early
LittlePNutss: same?  thats good, then i can let you go to
iamGracefuL16: yeah, but I don't know if I will.....
iamGracefuL16: cuz I'm talking to Andrew
LittlePNutss: it's really great talking to you, and i'm sure there will be plenty of time to talk later
LittlePNutss: or tomorrow
LittlePNutss: so i hope you have a good night

[18/08/2004 03:30 PM] Andrea: yeah, well the problem in my section

[18/08/2004 03:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: :-D
[18/08/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: then again you might be able to get away with making double tonguing a two person situation
[18/08/2004 03:55 PM] Andrea: haha
[18/08/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: *activity
