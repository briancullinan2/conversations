[02/24/2006 04:16 PM] Me: yes maybe
[02/24/2006 04:16 PM] Me: not sure
[02/24/2006 04:16 PM] Nate Casiraro: One way to make different concentrations of HCl in a 100.00 mL volumetric flask from a stock 5.0 M solution would be to use different volumetric pipets. What would be the molarity (M) of the 100.00 mL of dilute HCl if you used a 55.00 mL volumetric pipet?
[02/24/2006 04:16 PM] Nate Casiraro: do u know how to do that
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Me: maybe
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Me: not sure
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Me: m1*v1=m2*v2
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Nate Casiraro: well didnt u do it
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Nate Casiraro: do u know the answer
[02/24/2006 04:17 PM] Nate Casiraro: because it is due soon
