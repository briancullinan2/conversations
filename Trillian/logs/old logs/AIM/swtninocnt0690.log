[03/27/2006 03:21 PM] Katie Sharman: diff
[03/27/2006 03:21 PM] Katie Sharman: reading buret volumes is a ain in the butt
[03/27/2006 03:23 PM] Me: omfg yeah
[03/27/2006 03:23 PM] Me: i hate how you have to fucking scroll down every goddamn time

[03/27/2006 03:23 PM] Katie Sharman: yeah
[03/27/2006 03:23 PM] Katie Sharman: and u have to get it right to .002
[03/27/2006 03:24 PM] Me: does it want us to subtract it from 25ml?
[03/27/2006 03:25 PM] Katie Sharman: the # from the burett on the right minus the one on the left
[03/27/2006 03:26 PM] Me: no i mean for the first 2
[03/27/2006 03:26 PM] Me: where it is just the amount for each burret
[03/27/2006 03:26 PM] Katie Sharman: o
[03/27/2006 03:27 PM] Katie Sharman: u read it from the tp down
[03/27/2006 03:28 PM] Katie Sharman: if the blue is between 2 and 1.5 then the number should be
[03/27/2006 03:28 PM] Me: yeah
[03/27/2006 03:28 PM] Me: i hate this thing
[03/27/2006 03:29 PM] Katie Sharman: yeah

[03/27/2006 03:31 PM] Katie Sharman: ok
[03/27/2006 03:31 PM] Me: rinse inside walls of the flask?
[03/27/2006 03:31 PM] Katie Sharman: 5
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Katie Sharman: refill buret for next trial - 7
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Me: rinse the clean buret twice?
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Katie Sharman: add titrant to sample - 4
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Me: k
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Katie Sharman: rinse the clean buret twice - 1
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Katie Sharman: fill buret w titrant - 2
[03/27/2006 03:32 PM] Katie Sharman: when a light pink - 6
[03/27/2006 03:33 PM] Katie Sharman: rinse inside walls - 5
[03/27/2006 03:33 PM] Katie Sharman: refill if needed to between - 3
[03/27/2006 03:33 PM] Katie Sharman: rinse the clean buret - 1
[03/27/2006 03:35 PM] Katie Sharman: got it?
[03/27/2006 03:38 PM] Me: yeah
[03/27/2006 03:38 PM] Me: now i have another stupid math one
[03/27/2006 03:38 PM] Me: Estimating the mass of sample needed to optimize precision
[03/27/2006 03:38 PM] Katie Sharman: k
[03/27/2006 03:39 PM] Me: damnit i don't know how to do that one either
[03/27/2006 03:39 PM] Katie Sharman: ok
[03/27/2006 03:40 PM] Katie Sharman: what r ur #'s
[03/27/2006 03:40 PM] Me: If 6.74 mL NaOH was used in the titration of a 0.430 g sample use ratios to determine mass of sample needed to use 22.00 mL of NaOH in the next trial. 
 
[03/27/2006 03:41 PM] Katie Sharman: 1.404g
[03/27/2006 03:43 PM] Me: how did you figure that out?
[03/27/2006 03:44 PM] Katie Sharman: ratios
[03/27/2006 03:44 PM] Katie Sharman: 22*.43/6.74
[03/27/2006 03:47 PM] Me: If 6.68 mL NaOH was used in the titration of a 0.489 g sample of unknown, use ratios to determine the volume of NaOH needed in the next trial to titrate a sample mass of 0.847 g of your sample containing KHC8H4O4. 
 what will the final buret reading be if the initial buret reading is 1.04 mL. 
 
[03/27/2006 03:49 PM] Katie Sharman: 12.61mL
[03/27/2006 03:49 PM] Katie Sharman: i think
[03/27/2006 03:49 PM] Me: yes
[03/27/2006 03:49 PM] Me: where are these in the lab manual?
[03/27/2006 03:49 PM] Katie Sharman: ratios
[03/27/2006 03:50 PM] Katie Sharman: nt in the lab bok
[03/27/2006 03:50 PM] Katie Sharman: idk
[03/27/2006 03:50 PM] Katie Sharman: its math and im good at that
