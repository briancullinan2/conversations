*** Auto-response from grandslam419: Written with pen. 
 Sealed with a kiss. 
 If you are my friend. 
 Please answer this. 
 Are we friends? 
 Or are we not? 
 You told me once.  
 But i forgot. 
 So tell me now. 
 And tell me true.  
 So i can say. 
 "I'm here for you" 
 Of all the friends 
 I've ever met, 
 You're the one 
 I won't forget. 
 And if I die 
 Before you do, 
 I'll go to heaven 
 And wait for you. 
 I'll give the angels 
 Back their wings, 
 And risk the loss 
 Of everything. 
 Just to prove my 
 friendship is true.. 
 to have a friend like you!! 
 hey! brb!

[02/08/2004 11:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: hey read the site
[02/08/2004 11:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: it says right there
[02/08/2004 11:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know, it's hard to admit
[02/08/2004 11:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: you may think that only the "ronchie" girls admit that kind of secret
[02/08/2004 11:39 PM] Shannon: riiiiiiiiight
[02/08/2004 11:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: but when your alone, and it's dark in your room, and you might even be bored with nothing to do, or simply sexually unsatisfied, the urge will always be there for you
[02/08/2004 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: let it out i say, you have nothing to fear
[02/08/2004 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: :-D
[02/08/2004 11:40 PM] Shannon: um no
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: at least your not brutally wounded by the religious ritual also known as cercumsizing
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] Shannon: lol
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean seriously, that's like chopping off part of your fingure because the priest told you too
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: it hinders you for life
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: seriously
[02/08/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: it makes it less sensitive
[02/08/2004 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: Whenever I get really turned on, my chest becomes hot with blotchy red spots. Is this a problem or something to be alarmed about? They fade away after orgasm. 
  
 this is called a "sex flush," something about 25% of males may experience during high states of arousal, usually occurring on the torso above the waist, and sometimes extending to the face. 
 
[02/08/2004 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
