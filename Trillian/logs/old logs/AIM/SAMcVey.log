BrianJCullinan: i have been searching on how to use automatic e-mail in forms all morning and can't find anything that will work
BrianJCullinan: it all depends on an e-mail program installed on a server, our server is netfirms, but i don't have the authority to install anything on their server

*** Auto-response sent to samcvey: I am currently away from the computer.
BrianJCullinan: well i looked up on net firms that it does have a sendmail program installed
samcvey: So you just need sendmail?
BrianJCullinan: now i just need the darn IP address to put into the perl script because it is for security so only hvr1 IP address can use the script
BrianJCullinan: any idea where to find the IP address of our site?
samcvey: You can use a reverse lookup or just ping it.
samcvey: Looks like 209.171.43.13
BrianJCullinan: how?
samcvey: ping hvr1.com in the command line
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: ok i followed the directions
BrianJCullinan: i defined the only two variables it said to, 'referers' - who can use the script
 and mailprog - where the send mail program is
BrianJCullinan: now it should work right?
samcvey: Got me...never seen it before.

BrianJCullinan: thanks for the e-mail about forms
BrianJCullinan: but
BrianJCullinan: those all use the "maitto:" command, which uses your own mail client and just automatically compiles the results
BrianJCullinan: we need the servers mail client to send the forms because not everyone at home uses outlook or msn, and somepeople log on the a site in a webbrowser to check their mail
BrianJCullinan: in which case the default mail client in windows has not been changed from outlook express
BrianJCullinan: therefore when a "mailto:' event is called it opend the unconfigured outlook express
BrianJCullinan: and prompts the user to set up an acount, not send form results
BrianJCullinan: but, i will keep looking
samcvey: How are all these people creating Web sites with Dreamweaver that do that then?
*** Auto-response sent to samcvey: I am currently away from the computer.
BrianJCullinan: try filling out one of their example forms, and internet explorer will promt you and say that a form is trying to sumbit something, then if you have outlook open it will prompt you as well saying that something outside of outlook is trying to submit a form
BrianJCullinan: this is not an easy task, i've already tried the "mailto:" and decided to go beyond that
samcvey: I understand that some of these use the local client rather than the server's mail program. There must be an easy solution since this is a very common function for Web sites. I'd ask the hostinf company. Surely they must have clients that do this.
BrianJCullinan: the host at webdez, may not even have any send mail command set up on his server, he may just have the front page stuff set up, in which case there is no way for me to use front send mail command without using front page
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to call him, in a few days, i think he is out of town, in his last e-mail he said he was
samcvey: I'd ask anyways. Tell him you're using Dreamweaver and want the server to Email form results. Is it possible to create just the form page in FRontpage and put it on the site if this is the only solution?
BrianJCullinan: yeah i guess that would be ok too
BrianJCullinan: then i can add my style sheets and such using dreamweaver
BrianJCullinan: i just wish i knew enough
samcvey: I don't like using two tools for a single site, but it might get you around the issue temporarily.
BrianJCullinan: once i figure out how to using this, there really won't be any stopping us, we can find more clients after this, get some more business and such
BrianJCullinan: but if we use netfirms a lot, maybe they can get us some deals if we call in, maybe that would attract more people who need websites
BrianJCullinan: yeah i don't like using two tools, but then again most servers are built on linux just like net firms is

[14/06/2004 09:37 AM] samcvey: Do some searches on nVidia nFrce drivers. It's a relatively new chipset, so there may be some issues.

[14/06/2004 11:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: so it is something wrong with the display driver then?
[14/06/2004 11:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: that's what the article said
[14/06/2004 11:12 AM] samcvey: Looks that way.
[14/06/2004 11:12 AM] samcvey: I'd do what it says

[14/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: but windows didn't do exactly what it said it would
[14/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: the wizard again automatically put display drivers back in, eventhough the fix said that it would start a wizard and i should click cancel
[14/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: so should i reinstall the ati stuff?
[14/06/2004 11:27 AM] samcvey: Yes. As long as you cleaned everything out as instructed.

[16/06/2004 09:41 AM] BrianJCullinan: i got some data files from creata card and quicken
[16/06/2004 09:41 AM] BrianJCullinan: and copied over her games
[16/06/2004 09:41 AM] samcvey: Did you get the whole Quicken directory and test to see if it runs?
[16/06/2004 09:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: and some pictures
[16/06/2004 09:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: and her documents
[16/06/2004 09:42 AM] samcvey: Does creata card run?
[16/06/2004 09:44 AM] BrianJCullinan: haven't installed it
[16/06/2004 09:44 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'll do it now
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: why am i just now getting e-mails from 3 days ago
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] samcvey: OK. Do you have my list?
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: i checked my mail yesterday how come i didn't get them all then?
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes i do
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: want me to put quicken on?
[16/06/2004 09:45 AM] samcvey: Maybe we should just copy the entire old hard drive to a directory on the new one so it is all in one place.
[16/06/2004 09:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: doesn't matter they are both in the computer and accessible.
[16/06/2004 09:46 AM] samcvey: Which version of Quicken does she have? Can you copy the whole directory and get it running?
[16/06/2004 09:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i'll try the whole directory
[16/06/2004 09:47 AM] samcvey: OK. If that doesn't work, just leave it for me. We may need to upgrade because I don't have the older versions.
[16/06/2004 09:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[16/06/2004 09:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: quicken might be able to upgrade the data too
[16/06/2004 09:48 AM] samcvey: Don't want to leave the old drive in the system. Too much heat and slows everything down.

[16/06/2004 11:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: i copied over quicken
[16/06/2004 11:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: and some .dll files were missing so i moved them over to the same folder
[16/06/2004 11:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: it opened
[16/06/2004 11:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i loaded the data file
[16/06/2004 11:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: i also got creata card to work and copied those data files into the right place
[16/06/2004 11:26 AM] samcvey: Good. What's left?
[16/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: nothing on the list that i can do
[16/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: scanner?
[16/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: printer?
[16/06/2004 11:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: that's it
[16/06/2004 11:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: but windows will do it automatically as soon as it is pluged in
[16/06/2004 11:27 AM] samcvey: I downloaded printer drivers, but need to install with the printer hooked up. Scanner drivers cant be downloaded, they must be installed form disk.
[16/06/2004 11:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok but won't windows take care of that?
[16/06/2004 11:27 AM] samcvey: Probably not.
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: well then i guess it is done
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] samcvey: Just have to do it when I take it back.
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: did you still want me to copy over her hard drive
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: even though our list is complete
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: ?
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] samcvey: Not a bad idea.
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[16/06/2004 11:28 AM] samcvey: That way the files will be there if needed and we don't have to re-install the old drive.
[16/06/2004 11:29 AM] samcvey: We'll just delete them when we're sure everything is OK.
[16/06/2004 11:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[16/06/2004 11:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: want me to format the old one to?
[16/06/2004 11:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: by itself
[16/06/2004 11:30 AM] samcvey: Nope. Just leave everything on it for now.
[16/06/2004 11:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am copying it over now
[16/06/2004 11:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: could switching screens back and forth damage my monitor?

[30/07/2004 11:07 AM] samcvey: yes
[30/07/2004 11:07 AM] BrianJCullinan: i need a little help converting a tempo to seconds
[30/07/2004 11:07 AM] samcvey: ok
[30/07/2004 11:07 AM] samcvey: ok
[30/07/2004 11:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: so the tempo is 250, but it's cut time
[30/07/2004 11:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: so it is really 125
[30/07/2004 11:08 AM] samcvey: ok thats in beats per minute
[30/07/2004 11:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: so a whole note gets 2 clicks
[30/07/2004 11:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah so how do i convert that to miliseconds?
[30/07/2004 11:09 AM] samcvey: a whole note gets two clicks? or a quarter note?
[30/07/2004 11:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: a whole note
[30/07/2004 11:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: it's in cut time
[30/07/2004 11:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: it would get 4 clicks
[30/07/2004 11:10 AM] samcvey: so the teim signature is 2/2?
[30/07/2004 11:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[30/07/2004 11:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i need to convert that to milliseconds so that i can highlight the words on the website
[30/07/2004 11:11 AM] samcvey: tempo is 250 in 2/2 so a half note is one click
[30/07/2004 11:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: correct
[30/07/2004 11:11 AM] samcvey: so a whole note gets 2 clicks
[30/07/2004 11:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[30/07/2004 11:12 AM] samcvey: so what is the question you need to answer?
[30/07/2004 11:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: i need to convert that 2 clicks for a whole note into a millisecond length of time
[30/07/2004 11:13 AM] samcvey: 250/60 = beats/second
[30/07/2004 11:13 AM] samcvey: 4.1666_
[30/07/2004 11:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i got that
[30/07/2004 11:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: then divide by 2 to get the length of a whole note
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: 2.083_
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] samcvey: multiply
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] samcvey: by2
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: ohhhhh
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: then divide by 1000 to get the milliseconds
[30/07/2004 11:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: i mean multiply
[30/07/2004 11:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: no that doesn't work
[30/07/2004 11:17 AM] samcvey: we are still in beats per second
[30/07/2004 11:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[30/07/2004 11:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: so now how to i get the length of a half note?
[30/07/2004 11:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: it's half the time right?
[30/07/2004 11:18 AM] samcvey: 1 second/4.1666 = .24 second
[30/07/2004 11:19 AM] samcvey: each half note is .24 of a second
[30/07/2004 11:19 AM] samcvey: each whole note is .48 of a second
[30/07/2004 11:20 AM] samcvey: times 1000 = 240 for a half note or 480 for a whole note
[30/07/2004 11:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: no, we're 1 division behind
[30/07/2004 11:21 AM] samcvey: whats that mean?
[30/07/2004 11:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: 833 matches the whole note, 480 matches the halfnote when i put it with the music
[30/07/2004 11:22 AM] samcvey: 480 *2=960
[30/07/2004 11:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[30/07/2004 11:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: that works
[30/07/2004 11:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'll upload it and show you
[30/07/2004 11:23 AM] samcvey: what is it?

[30/07/2004 11:25 AM] BrianJCullinan: of course it has to load
[30/07/2004 11:27 AM] samcvey: You should divide the text by the line of the song. Each line ends randonmly now.
[30/07/2004 11:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[30/07/2004 11:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: but at least it is the right length of time
[30/07/2004 11:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: now i have to figure out how to get the music and text to start at the same time
[30/07/2004 11:28 AM] samcvey: you know how many miliseconds for each beat, which equals a word or syllable.
[30/07/2004 11:28 AM] samcvey: Of course, I would want to read ahead so I could sing it. Just do it a line at a time
[30/07/2004 11:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: well i was going to put line breaks
[30/07/2004 11:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: but keep the highlighting the word like cakewalk does
[30/07/2004 11:29 AM] samcvey: I see you are just highlighting the word

[16/08/2004 02:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok they are downloaded now how do install them?
[16/08/2004 02:16 PM] samcvey: Either burn to a boot CD or look at instructions on fedora site
[16/08/2004 02:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: the instruction at the bottom of the download page is for linux users who have the same type of command promt
[16/08/2004 02:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: and what is a boot cd?
[16/08/2004 02:17 PM] samcvey: You can boot from the first CD once you burn them
[16/08/2004 02:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: just burn them as iso files?
[16/08/2004 02:28 PM] samcvey: Not sure. ISO is a CD image. I think Roxio will figure that out, but I don't know if Windows will do it.
[16/08/2004 02:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: i guess we will find out
[16/08/2004 02:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: that means i'll have to copy it to your computer
[16/08/2004 02:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: looks like it just burnt the file
[16/08/2004 02:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'll have to back up my drive to your comp
[16/08/2004 02:35 PM] samcvey: Try the Roxio software on my machine

[16/08/2004 02:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm copying them to your computer
[16/08/2004 02:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: then i'll burn it
[16/08/2004 02:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: and start the install i already printed out all the directions for dual boot to have with me
[16/08/2004 02:53 PM] samcvey: OK. Just right click and open to start EasyCD Creator
[16/08/2004 02:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i did
[16/08/2004 02:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: i found where to click it just said it could cause problems if it isn't on the hard drive
[16/08/2004 02:54 PM] samcvey: OK.
[16/08/2004 02:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i guess we will see how it goes

[16/08/2004 04:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: i like source code
[16/08/2004 04:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is still copying to your computer
[16/08/2004 04:03 PM] samcvey: OK.
[16/08/2004 04:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: should be done in the next hour or so, just in time for you and i to mess around with it
[16/08/2004 04:03 PM] samcvey: Seems like a waste of time and bandwidth to download all that
[16/08/2004 04:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: bandwidth?
[16/08/2004 04:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: we have limits on how much we can download?
[16/08/2004 04:04 PM] samcvey: No, but why download all that just to throw it away?
[16/08/2004 04:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: i won't throw it away
[16/08/2004 04:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll learn how to change it
[16/08/2004 04:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it's not taking up my time
[16/08/2004 04:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: the nice thing about azurues is it copyies just as fast as windows but it takes up very little cpu
[16/08/2004 04:05 PM] samcvey: I'd rather you spend your time on homework and learning the basics. The source will be hugely complex
[16/08/2004 04:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i can do anything else at the same time
[16/08/2004 04:06 PM] samcvey: ???
[16/08/2004 04:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: at the same time it can download and not inturupt me at all
[16/08/2004 04:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean unlike a windows copy, i can play quake at the same time
[16/08/2004 04:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: and cpu usage is being replaced by a stalling network like windows always does
[16/08/2004 04:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: *isn't
[16/08/2004 04:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: did i mention it can resume transfer instead of completely canceling and deleting the progress

[19/10/2004 02:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i think i change the virtual server
[19/10/2004 02:52 PM] samcvey: do it and ill try
[19/10/2004 02:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: and the firewall remote desktop setting is dependant on the virtual server setting
[19/10/2004 02:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok try it now
[19/10/2004 02:53 PM] samcvey: That works
[19/10/2004 02:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: wonderful
[19/10/2004 02:53 PM] samcvey: so no DMZ change required?
[19/10/2004 02:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i don't know if it has been changed back

[19/10/2004 02:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: wait one more thing, does norton have a built in firewall?
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] samcvey: no
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: should i reenable the sp2 one?
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] samcvey: THere is a Norton Internet security product
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: should i turn on sp2?
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] samcvey: If you had your SP2 firewall on, that would stop it from working
[19/10/2004 02:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: no, it sets itself up to allow remote desktop

[04/18/2005 01:27 PM] Me: there we go
[04/18/2005 01:31 PM] Me: i like the dual LAN
[04/18/2005 01:31 PM] Me: that would be really useful
[04/18/2005 01:31 PM] samcvey: for what?
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] Me: then i wouldn't need a router for just 2 computers
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] samcvey: true
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] Me: and if i had one, i wouldn't need a router in college
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] Me: eric could just plug into mine
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] samcvey: maybe...
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] samcvey: you son't know the specifics of their LAN yet
[04/18/2005 01:32 PM] Me: its not out?
[04/18/2005 01:33 PM] samcvey: what?
[04/18/2005 01:33 PM] Me: the KN1
[04/18/2005 01:33 PM] Me: how come it doesn't show up on newegg.com?
[04/18/2005 01:33 PM] Me: can you even buy the ecs yet?
[04/18/2005 01:34 PM] samcvey: thought so
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] Me: it supports Realtek ALC655 6-Channel audio CODEC but in the pictures there are only 3 jacks
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] Me: on the dfi, it specifically says 6 jacks
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] samcvey: dfi is 8-channel
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] Me: so is the KN1 like the one i have now?
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] Me: where it switches the microphone and input out for speakers?
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] samcvey: yes 6-channel has only 3 jacks
[04/18/2005 01:35 PM] Me: oh
[04/18/2005 01:36 PM] Me: so it would not support a 5.1 surround?
[04/18/2005 01:36 PM] Me: but the 8-channel would?
[04/18/2005 01:36 PM] samcvey: tat is 6 channel
[04/18/2005 01:37 PM] Me: but how can it supports a 5.1 speaker with on 3 jacks?
[04/18/2005 01:37 PM] Me: *only
[04/18/2005 01:37 PM] samcvey: 2 speakers each jack
[04/18/2005 01:38 PM] Me: so it does replace the microphone and audio-in for speaker jacks?
[04/18/2005 01:38 PM] samcvey: not sure. i think so
[04/18/2005 01:38 PM] Me: that's what i don't like about this one now, because i'm already out one jack because of my ATI stuff
[04/18/2005 01:39 PM] Me: but the 8 channel has 6 jacks, 2 speakers on 3 jacks, 1 sub, 1 mic, and 1 input
[04/18/2005 01:39 PM] Me: i think, that makes sense right?
[04/18/2005 01:39 PM] samcvey: look at the doc for my new one
[04/18/2005 01:40 PM] Me: is that a PF21?
[04/18/2005 01:40 PM] Me: oh yeah the PF21 has 6 jacks
[04/18/2005 01:40 PM] Me: its just the KN1 that only has 3
[04/18/2005 01:41 PM] Me: yeah i would definitely like to have an 8-channel for AMD
[04/18/2005 01:42 PM] samcvey: i have the 915p-a
[04/18/2005 01:42 PM] Me: its an 8-channel right
[04/18/2005 01:42 PM] samcvey: yes
[04/18/2005 01:42 PM] Me: awesome
[04/18/2005 01:42 PM] samcvey: kn1 is only $129
[04/18/2005 01:45 PM] Me: yeah but that audio means a lot to me
[04/18/2005 01:45 PM] samcvey: you have yet to use anything beyond 2 speakers...
[04/18/2005 01:45 PM] Me: PCI Express x1 slots what are those for
[04/18/2005 01:46 PM] Me: ?
[04/18/2005 01:46 PM] samcvey: not sure
[04/18/2005 01:47 PM] Me: look at the Serial ATA with RAID on the DFI
[04/18/2005 01:47 PM] Me: all of that looks good
[04/18/2005 01:49 PM] Me: i don't know to much around RAID
[04/18/2005 01:49 PM] samcvey: hsa to be 64-bit processor
[04/18/2005 01:50 PM] Me: i am thinking about that too, now that the prices are going down
[04/18/2005 01:50 PM] Me: and i will have spent the whole summer saving up by the time i go to buy one
[04/18/2005 01:50 PM] Me: does it have to be a 64 bit OS?
[04/18/2005 01:50 PM] samcvey: not sure
[04/18/2005 01:51 PM] Me: 6 USB ports on the DFI

[04/28/2005 12:15 PM] samcvey: yes, read the doc to make sure you have the right drivers for sounds, LAN, etc
[04/28/2005 12:15 PM] Me: i am having problems with internet explorer

[04/28/2005 12:19 PM] Me: probably and IE Error
[04/28/2005 12:19 PM] Me: i ran a virus scan and a spy sweep and it didn't improve

[04/28/2005 12:57 PM] samcvey: you can check, but i think you may need separate drivers for each

[04/28/2005 01:36 PM] samcvey: does reboot clear it up?
[04/28/2005 01:36 PM] Me: nope
[04/28/2005 01:37 PM] samcvey: yes, i would install everything that is not via chipset driver
[04/28/2005 01:37 PM] Me: no chipset drivers show up
[04/28/2005 01:37 PM] Me: i already installed hyperion
[04/28/2005 01:38 PM] Me: i guess i'll just put these on top of it
[04/28/2005 01:40 PM] Me: so i don't need to install the IDE driver?
[04/28/2005 01:40 PM] Me: because that's included in the hyperion
[04/28/2005 01:40 PM] samcvey: what they are calling IDE is the via drivers
[04/28/2005 01:40 PM] Me: ok
[04/28/2005 01:41 PM] samcvey: there are probably updated drivers for rais, lan, sound, but windows update will give you those after you install these
[04/28/2005 01:42 PM] Me: ok
[04/28/2005 02:23 PM] Me: i installed everything
[04/28/2005 02:23 PM] Me: but there are devices that are still unknown
[04/28/2005 02:32 PM] samcvey: usb?
[04/28/2005 02:32 PM] Me: i installed USB
[04/28/2005 02:33 PM] Me: oh, it was sound
[04/28/2005 02:33 PM] Me: it shows up the right way now
[04/28/2005 02:35 PM] Me: everything works
[04/28/2005 02:35 PM] Me: spysweeper
[04/28/2005 02:35 PM] Me: norton
[04/28/2005 02:35 PM] Me: all installed
[04/28/2005 02:35 PM] Me: now for office 2003
[04/28/2005 02:37 PM] Me: good stuff
[04/28/2005 02:38 PM] Me: oh yeah and about the monitor being strange, all i had to do with switch the cords around and mine looks fine, the temporary is a little strange but no biggie
[04/28/2005 02:38 PM] Me: i wish i could fix that problem with IE
[04/28/2005 02:38 PM] Me: i will see what Andrew suggests
[04/28/2005 02:43 PM] samcvey: ok. gotta go.

[05/18/2005 03:46 PM] Me: sry i wasn't advertising on purpose
[05/18/2005 03:46 PM] samcvey: hmmm. what criteria will he use to determine that?

[05/18/2005 03:46 PM] Me: no criteria
[05/18/2005 03:47 PM] samcvey: did you get your rooms taken care of?
[05/18/2005 03:47 PM] Me: i booked my dad rooms with an exmployee code

[05/18/2005 03:49 PM] Me: so i gave him a call back and told him that so i am gonna call him tomorrow also
[05/18/2005 03:50 PM] Me: my dad wasn't too upset

[05/18/2005 04:03 PM] Me: we did
[05/18/2005 04:03 PM] Me: and used an employee code online
[05/18/2005 04:03 PM] samcvey: can he get a better rate?

Where is the mystery in all of this coming from? Do you need my help in picking one out? I doubt that but let me know. Is the VooDoo one it? In other words, get one picked out and we will buy it, now, don't wait, just do it. - Dad (Jim)
[06/20/2005 11:31 AM] Me: I guess i should go ahead and get one then, i tried to tell him i should maybe wait until around christmas so i could make sure i needed one

[06/20/2005 11:32 AM] samcvey: Well... Sounds like you have the green light. Go to Dell and configure what you think you need. (not necessarily what you WANT)
[06/20/2005 11:32 AM] Me: Dell?  but i don't like dell

[06/20/2005 11:35 AM] Me: i like this Voodoo

[06/20/2005 11:45 AM] samcvey: what are your options?
[06/20/2005 11:46 AM] Me: well the processor in both are equal
 the os is equal
 the memory in the Voodoo is Crucial where are dell doesn't specify
[06/20/2005 11:47 AM] samcvey: ok one more time... thirty six thousand dollars? are you kidding?
[06/20/2005 11:49 AM] Me: oops
[06/20/2005 11:49 AM] Me: one to many 0s
[06/20/2005 11:49 AM] Me: 3,600
[06/20/2005 11:50 AM] samcvey: I have no doubt that spending three times as much should get you some advantages..
[06/20/2005 11:50 AM] Me: actually its only about 1,000 over what is available online
[06/20/2005 11:50 AM] samcvey: so thats 50% more money
[06/20/2005 11:52 AM] Me: the voodoo has no crappy AOL to uninstall where as the dell does, the voodoo comes with the extra battery, and car adapted and backpack carrying case customize for your machine choice
[06/20/2005 11:52 AM] samcvey: worth $1000?
[06/20/2005 11:53 AM] Me: and the 15.4" screen
[06/20/2005 11:54 AM] Me: with a built in camera at the top

[06/20/2005 11:54 AM] samcvey: I just think it's an expensive toy

[06/20/2005 11:56 AM] samcvey: i doubt any computer you buy now will be current in four years
[06/20/2005 11:56 AM] samcvey: will it run longhorn?
[06/20/2005 11:56 AM] samcvey: what about the one after thta?

[06/23/2005 12:59 PM] Me: if i was planning on getting a new motherboard and video card, should i get an AGP slot for the All-in-wonder X800 XT, or a pci-e slot for the AIW X600?  Andrew says the pci-e has no advantages and there is no video board that can take advantage of extra speed
[06/23/2005 01:02 PM] samcvey: don't thinkit matters that much, but.... my PCIe is quite fast for a mid-level board.
[06/23/2005 01:02 PM] samcvey: you only get PCIe with Intel chipsets, however
[06/23/2005 01:02 PM] Me: the asus board has an AMD PCI-E
[06/23/2005 01:03 PM] Me: and the AIW X600 has 256MB DDR just like the X800

[06/23/2005 01:04 PM] Me: awesome
[06/23/2005 01:04 PM] Me: i didn't know you got the new AIW
[06/23/2005 01:04 PM] samcvey: So it looks like nvidia has PCIe now
[06/23/2005 01:04 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] Me: they started the whole SLI stuff
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] Me: that's the other advantage to PCI-E
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] samcvey: not a big nvisia chipset fan
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] samcvey: is that what you have?
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:05 PM] Me: everything is alright except the sound card
[06/23/2005 01:06 PM] samcvey: i'd go with PCIe. i think you won't fins AGP much longer
[06/23/2005 01:06 PM] Me: i like the nvidia stuff
[06/23/2005 01:06 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:06 PM] Me: that's what i think to, i am just disappointed about no x800 pci-e
[06/23/2005 01:06 PM] Me: and there probably won't be for a while
[06/23/2005 01:07 PM] samcvey: go find a review or two - Tom's hardware?
[06/23/2005 01:07 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:08 PM] Me: the soundcard on top of my nvidia chipset now is c-media and its a piece of junk, but this ASUS board i am looking at has Realtek and they are a lot higher end
[06/23/2005 01:08 PM] samcvey: need to go to fry's tonight for grandma's PC
[06/23/2005 01:16 PM] Me: how about a dual chip board like dual opterons with the new dual cores, 4 cores on 1 board
[06/23/2005 01:16 PM] samcvey: sounds good. your money, right?
[06/23/2005 01:16 PM] Me: lol
[06/23/2005 01:17 PM] Me: this time yeah
[06/23/2005 01:18 PM] Me: if i get a new desktop for use in my dorm room and backup, gaming, storage purposes i want it to be somewhat powerful, but none the stuff i am looking at is at the top or bottom of the line
[06/23/2005 01:18 PM] Me: if i wanted top of the line i would order dual opteron or dual xeons right now
[06/23/2005 01:18 PM] Me: but i'm waiting for seagates new 7200.9 500GB 16MB cache drives to come out
[06/23/2005 01:19 PM] samcvey: i hope you don't cry when your megabucks system becomes obsolete in 4 months
[06/23/2005 01:19 PM] Me: you think it will only last 4 months?
[06/23/2005 01:20 PM] Me: it won't be obsolete to me, because i will still be able to use it
[06/23/2005 01:20 PM] Me: and it will still be really nice
[06/23/2005 01:20 PM] Me: and a lot better then the one i have now
[06/23/2005 01:20 PM] samcvey: probably.... X800 PCIe, newer chipsets, processors, better memory, something will be out of date
[06/23/2005 01:20 PM] Me: yeah but there will be no game that can take advatage of what there is now anyways
[06/23/2005 01:21 PM] Me: Half Life 2 barely runs now
[06/23/2005 01:21 PM] samcvey: for at least 4 months....
[06/23/2005 01:21 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:22 PM] Me: but at least i will be able to play Half Life 2
[06/23/2005 01:22 PM] samcvey: that's a $4000 game
[06/23/2005 01:22 PM] Me: i'm not gonna spend that much on it
[06/23/2005 01:22 PM] Me: i'm thinking around 1,500
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] samcvey: so when are you going to build it?
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] Me: besides that's just one of the awesome things i will be able to run on it
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] Me: i am thinking late july
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] Me: before my trip with aunt linda
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] samcvey: ok. Going with me tonight?
[06/23/2005 01:23 PM] Me: this is what i had originally planned spending the extra money from my dad on
[06/23/2005 01:24 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:24 PM] samcvey: I think Fry's has the asus board
[06/23/2005 01:24 PM] Me: yeah they do
[06/23/2005 01:24 PM] Me: but Asus might come out with a new very soon, they have been working on some pentium boards
[06/23/2005 01:24 PM] Me: so what ever is available late july should last me a while

[06/29/2005 10:26 AM] Me: If my dad sends me a sheet of plexiglass for less the 110$ will you help me build a computer case?
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] samcvey: and your objective is to have a clear case? or just the ouside?
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] Me: have a clear case
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] samcvey: Don' they make clear cases already?
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] Me: they are available
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] Me: for 110 dollars
[06/29/2005 10:31 AM] Me: assembly required
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] samcvey: sounds like a bargain to me
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] Me: its the experience that matters
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] samcvey: i see
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] Me: i want to make one myself but i would need your help
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] samcvey: i'd be happy to "help"
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] Me: and i want to instead spend some of the money i would save on lighting
[06/29/2005 10:32 AM] samcvey: as long as that doesn't mean I'm on the hook for a certain time 
[06/29/2005 10:33 AM] Me: on the hook?
[06/29/2005 10:33 AM] samcvey: responsible for completion by a certain date
[06/29/2005 10:33 AM] samcvey: in other words, this is your project and i am helpoing
[06/29/2005 10:33 AM] samcvey: not my project
[06/29/2005 10:34 AM] Me: what it means is i am not entirely sure i know how to plan what need to be done
[06/29/2005 10:34 AM] Me: obviously there are going to be a lot of measurements
[06/29/2005 10:34 AM] Me: i will need help with that
[06/29/2005 10:34 AM] Me: but things like cutting along the line i can do on my own
[06/29/2005 10:34 AM] samcvey: ok, i will help
[06/29/2005 10:35 AM] Me: i have a lot of plans swirling around that would be really cool
[06/29/2005 10:35 AM] Me: but they are mostly a little further down the line
[06/29/2005 10:35 AM] samcvey: search the Web for specs if you can
[06/29/2005 10:36 AM] Me: i looked up some prices of boards of plexiglass and found someone that made one themselves for only 20 bucks
[06/29/2005 10:36 AM] samcvey: for example, how wide is a hard drive bay, etc.
[06/29/2005 10:36 AM] Me: i found another site you can order a sheet 48x92 inches for 52 bucks
[06/29/2005 10:37 AM] samcvey: but shipping might be a problem. better to get it locally probably
[06/29/2005 10:37 AM] Me: so it must be just as cheap for my dad to get it, shipping and packaging might cost a bundle though
[06/29/2005 10:37 AM] samcvey: maybe he can have a supplier drop-ship it to you
[06/29/2005 10:37 AM] samcvey: of course, we'd have to work on it in the garage...hot
[06/29/2005 10:37 AM] Me: yeah
[06/29/2005 10:46 AM] Me: do you need a special light to use fiber optics?
[06/29/2005 10:47 AM] samcvey: no. i assume you just want it for looks, not for data transmission
[06/29/2005 10:48 AM] Me: yes
[06/29/2005 10:49 AM] samcvey: something that uses little power and generates low heat, such as an LED would be best
[06/29/2005 10:53 AM] Me: i even found a site to order fiber optic spools if we can't find someplace local
[06/29/2005 10:54 AM] Me: and thinkgeek.com offers a lot of cool lighting products
[06/29/2005 10:54 AM] samcvey: i'd check at fry's also.
[06/29/2005 10:54 AM] samcvey: never really looked for this stuff there, but they have a lot of components
[06/29/2005 10:54 AM] Me: yeah we could probably find most of it at Frys but would they have fiber optics?
[06/29/2005 10:55 AM] samcvey: possibly
[06/29/2005 11:07 AM] samcvey: (Link: http://www.xpcgear.com/clearcase.html)http://www.xpcgear.com/clearcase.html
[06/29/2005 11:08 AM] Me: not enough drive bays
[06/29/2005 11:08 AM] samcvey: (Link: http://www.clearcomputercase.com/index.htm)http://www.clearcomputercase.com/index.htm
[06/29/2005 11:08 AM] Me: nice
[06/29/2005 11:08 AM] samcvey: just google clear computer case and you should get lots of hits
[06/29/2005 11:09 AM] Me: yeah
[06/29/2005 11:09 AM] Me: but these are really expensive
[06/29/2005 11:11 AM] samcvey: (Link: http://www.xoxide.com/acryliccases.html)http://www.xoxide.com/acryliccases.html
[06/29/2005 11:11 AM] Me: these aren't to bad
[06/29/2005 11:11 AM] samcvey: lots of choices
[06/29/2005 11:11 AM] Me: don't you think it would be fun to do it ourselves though?
[06/29/2005 11:12 AM] samcvey: could be, but won't be easy
[06/29/2005 11:12 AM] Me: no definitely not
[06/29/2005 11:14 AM] Me: maybe i will just order one of these and add on to it
[06/29/2005 11:14 AM] Me: add lighting or change what they have
[06/29/2005 11:14 AM] samcvey: seems like a smart idea
[06/29/2005 11:15 AM] Me: i thought it would be awesome to draw the blueprints on the case with fiber optics
[06/29/2005 11:15 AM] samcvey: the one place you can order pieces like handles and switches
[06/29/2005 11:16 AM] Me: yeah
[06/29/2005 11:16 AM] Me: clear handles
[06/29/2005 11:20 AM] Me: i want LED feet!
[06/29/2005 11:20 AM] Me: lol
[06/29/2005 11:20 AM] samcvey: you'll have to turn your pc off to get to sleep
[06/29/2005 11:20 AM] Me: my server won't work up there anyways
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] samcvey: ???
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] Me: NAU gives everyone server space
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] Me: so i don't need to use my computer
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] Me: (Link: http://www.xpcgear.com/ledcanonuv.html)http://www.xpcgear.com/ledcanonuv.html
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] Me: say i got one of those how could be attach fiber optics to it?
[06/29/2005 11:21 AM] Me: just fiber optic cords
[06/29/2005 11:22 AM] Me: which then go around to different places on the side of my case
[06/29/2005 11:24 AM] Me: (Link: http://www.xpcgear.com/blueelcable.html)http://www.xpcgear.com/blueelcable.html
[06/29/2005 11:24 AM] Me: that is really cool stuff
[06/29/2005 11:35 AM] samcvey: what's this pediatrics note you printed?
[06/29/2005 11:35 AM] Me: oh
[06/29/2005 11:35 AM] Me: you have to call them
[06/29/2005 11:35 AM] Me: because they can't bill you
[06/29/2005 11:35 AM] samcvey: i called but its a fax machine
[06/29/2005 11:36 AM] Me: that's the number she gave me
[06/29/2005 11:36 AM] samcvey: remember the name of the place?
[06/29/2005 11:37 AM] Me: no i think it came up on the phone as private caller
[06/29/2005 11:37 AM] samcvey: ok have to look it up
[06/29/2005 11:43 AM] Me: i want a PSP
[06/29/2005 11:43 AM] samcvey: go buy it then
[06/29/2005 11:44 AM] Me: they r expensive, but aren't decreasing in price
[06/29/2005 11:44 AM] samcvey: buy a used one
[06/29/2005 11:46 AM] Me: the only reason someone would return it is because of dead pixels from not taking care of it
[06/29/2005 11:46 AM] samcvey: check ebay
[06/29/2005 11:47 AM] Me: supposedly they are somewhat sensitive
[06/29/2005 11:47 AM] samcvey: costco had them
[06/29/2005 11:47 AM] Me: oh yeah, do you remember how much?
[06/29/2005 11:47 AM] samcvey: no
[06/29/2005 11:47 AM] Me: ...
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] Me: supposedly the only place that isn't sold out is toys r us
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] samcvey: search online
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] Me: how come my online banking isn't working?
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] samcvey: dont know
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] Me: it says it encountered an error
[06/29/2005 11:48 AM] samcvey: can you sign on?
[06/29/2005 11:49 AM] Me: barely
[06/29/2005 11:49 AM] Me: i have to try multiple times
[06/29/2005 11:49 AM] samcvey: call them
[06/29/2005 11:49 AM] Me: it isn't that it doesn't change pages, it says it can't be found
[06/29/2005 11:49 AM] samcvey: call them
[06/29/2005 11:50 AM] Me: now?
[06/29/2005 11:50 AM] samcvey: if you need to access it now then yes
[06/29/2005 11:50 AM] Me: well if i buy a PSP i need to transfer some funds, but i don't want to spend my money
[06/29/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: choices...neds vs. wants
[06/29/2005 11:51 AM] Me: i want one because they are really awesome and entertaining and can be used for much more then just gaming
[06/29/2005 11:51 AM] Me: they are a full media player in one high def screen
[06/29/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: are you trying to talk me into it?
[06/29/2005 11:52 AM] Me: well who really needs toys?
[06/29/2005 11:52 AM] Me: doesn't mean they aren't nice to have
[06/29/2005 11:52 AM] samcvey: agreed
[06/29/2005 11:52 AM] samcvey: money vs. fun
[06/29/2005 11:53 AM] samcvey: i hope youre reading that book so i can get it soon
[06/29/2005 11:53 AM] Me: i am

[06/30/2005 02:34 PM] Me: so i guess i have to get a game for this thing not that i have it
[06/30/2005 02:34 PM] Me: *now
[06/30/2005 02:35 PM] Me: why do they have to make things so expensive...
[06/30/2005 02:40 PM] samcvey: its an evil scheme to get your money
[06/30/2005 02:40 PM] *** Auto-response sent to samcvey: The problem with America is stupidity. I'm not saying there should be a capital punishment for stupidity, but why don't we just take the safety labels off of everything and let the problem solve itself?
[06/30/2005 02:40 PM] samcvey: and its working
[06/30/2005 02:50 PM] Me: yeah
[06/30/2005 02:50 PM] Me: but maybe i can get this thing to work for me
[06/30/2005 02:51 PM] samcvey: do you mean write code for it and make maoney?
[06/30/2005 02:52 PM] Me: no because i haven't purchased the 120,000 dollar PSP SDK from sony
[06/30/2005 02:52 PM] Me: so that would be illegal
[06/30/2005 02:52 PM] Me: but there are people that have written their own compilers for it
[06/30/2005 02:52 PM] Me: that would be considered "hacking" which to an extent can be legal
[06/30/2005 02:53 PM] Me: as long as i am not pirating Sony software
[06/30/2005 02:53 PM] Me: and developing my own source code
[06/30/2005 02:56 PM] samcvey: nice of them to create an "open" platform
[06/30/2005 02:56 PM] Me: lol
[06/30/2005 02:57 PM] Me: always
[06/30/2005 02:57 PM] Me: but then anyone could make a game for it
[06/30/2005 02:57 PM] samcvey: and there would be lots of games so everyone would want to buy a PSP!
[06/30/2005 02:57 PM] Me: you wouldn't want everyone going out am making their own games and selling them and making more then the large companies like Electronic Arts
[06/30/2005 02:58 PM] Me: and then people would make viruses for them
[06/30/2005 02:58 PM] Me: and then you would have a mess
[06/30/2005 03:10 PM] Me: ah
[06/30/2005 03:10 PM] Me: so i guess i am going to go get a game now
[06/30/2005 03:10 PM] Me: i will not be out long

[06/30/2005 03:13 PM] Me: hey i got a question
[06/30/2005 03:13 PM] samcvey: yes
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] Me: if i plug my camera into my computer through USB, is there someway i can get it to save to the hard drive?
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] Me: instead of the memory card
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] samcvey: dont think so
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] samcvey: you mean take a picture and have it show up on your hard drive?
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] Me: yes
[06/30/2005 03:14 PM] Me: i thought that would be interesting because what if then you can plug it into an extern usb drive
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] samcvey: doubt it
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] samcvey: the camera isnt smart enough to attach additional drives
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] Me: can't it act like a web cam or something
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] Me: yeah i guess so
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] Me: i read it somewhere in forums last night
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] samcvey: probably can be a web cam, that doesnt mean you can save still  directly there
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] samcvey: stills
[06/30/2005 03:15 PM] Me: i haven't been sleeping well at night i was hoping i could take one of those pills
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] samcvey: you could have the webcam software take stills
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] Me: and another question, what size memory card did you get for my Sony Camera?
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] samcvey: and how much dr. pepper did you have at the movie?
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] Me: not very much
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] samcvey: but some
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] Me: i didn't even finish all of it
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] Me: like a half of cup
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] samcvey: at what time?
[06/30/2005 03:16 PM] Me: around 9
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] samcvey: doesnt take much
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] samcvey: that late
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] samcvey: try no caffeine tonight
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] Me: ok
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] Me: but what size memory card did you get for my camera?
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] Me: was is a 256?
[06/30/2005 03:17 PM] Me: or bigger?
[06/30/2005 03:18 PM] Me: and there is also a 64 too right?
[06/30/2005 03:18 PM] samcvey: i think 256
[06/30/2005 03:18 PM] samcvey: should be the one that came with it
[06/30/2005 03:18 PM] Me: well to bad those won't fit in the PSP
[06/30/2005 03:19 PM] Me: which is why instead of buying another 60 dollar memory card for it, i bought a 35 dollar converter
[06/30/2005 03:19 PM] samcvey: i se
[06/30/2005 03:19 PM] samcvey: see
[06/30/2005 03:19 PM] Me: not i will get 320 MB more space for 35 dollars
[06/30/2005 03:19 PM] Me: sounds like a deal to me
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] samcvey: will it stick out of the psp?
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] Me: yes
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] Me: but that's a minor sacrifice for the amount of space per dollar that i get
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] Me: i am gonna go shower
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] Me: ttyl
[06/30/2005 03:20 PM] samcvey: ok

[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] Me: not turning on
[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] Me: at all
[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] samcvey: that wasn't a choice
[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] samcvey: so not recognized
[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] Me: yeah
[07/05/2005 10:54 AM] samcvey: Very expensive
[07/05/2005 10:55 AM] samcvey: Whose?
[07/05/2005 10:55 AM] Me: i thought so
[07/05/2005 10:55 AM] Me: gregs
[07/05/2005 10:55 AM] Me: thank god its not me
[07/05/2005 10:55 AM] samcvey: Take it to a recovery clean room where they will take it apart and recover it. $400-$1,000 i think
[07/05/2005 10:56 AM] samcvey: Put it in your system and make sure it's not a cable or bad motherboard
[07/05/2005 10:56 AM] Me: he says it smells like it is burning
[07/05/2005 10:56 AM] samcvey: is it turning?
[07/05/2005 10:56 AM] Me: no
[07/05/2005 10:56 AM] samcvey: sounds bad
[07/05/2005 10:57 AM] Me: yeah
[07/05/2005 10:57 AM] samcvey: only option is to put it in another system to be sure its the drive
[07/05/2005 11:00 AM] Me: yeah

[07/06/2005 10:29 AM] Me: my dad has not even got the laptop shipped yet
[07/06/2005 10:30 AM] Me: newegg said they couldn't ship it directly to my address because it wasn't the one on his credit card
[07/06/2005 10:30 AM] Me: and he was not able to write it off as a business expense
[07/06/2005 10:30 AM] Me: so it will be a while before i even see it, probably next week sometime
[07/06/2005 10:31 AM] samcvey: no hurry. one of the developers here has the ferrari
[07/06/2005 10:31 AM] samcvey: looks nice

[07/07/2005 11:27 AM] Me: hmm
[07/07/2005 11:27 AM] samcvey: gotta run. figure out shich software you stopped using at 1:10ish this morning
[07/07/2005 11:27 AM] samcvey: which
[07/07/2005 11:27 AM] Me: well i am not a hacker and wouldn't even know where to start so my PC must be doing something that i don't know about
[07/07/2005 11:27 AM] Me: lets see if it continues
[07/07/2005 11:28 AM] samcvey: it started at 10:00 pm last night and stopped at 1:10am this morning.

[07/25/2005 02:40 PM] Me: i'll tell you exactly why more kids aren't going into conputer science
[07/25/2005 02:41 PM] Me: *computer
[07/25/2005 02:41 PM] Me: they're hooked on so much technology--cell phones, digital music players, instant messaging, Internet browsing
[07/25/2005 02:41 PM] Me: all of those things listed are owned by proprietary companies that spend most of their revenue on protecting their secrets
[07/25/2005 02:42 PM] Me: Sony is a dominating manufacture of electronics and they can't even allow their new PSP system to be modified without throwing a hissy fit, all they do in hinder creativity among the computer science world
[07/25/2005 02:42 PM] samcvey: So go make yourself a proriietary secret and get rich...
[07/25/2005 02:42 PM] Me: and add to the problem?
[07/25/2005 02:43 PM] samcvey: Did you see my note on attack on port 26310?
[07/25/2005 02:43 PM] samcvey: Still getting lots of them
[07/25/2005 02:43 PM] Me: so more kids my age now can be left discouraged and feel like they don't want to be apart of that business and switch to criminal law
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] samcvey: Why did you give them your money then?
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: i don't know
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: i thought it might be fun
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: hmm i don't have anything out of the usual running
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: anywho
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] samcvey: Why not build a similar device with all open source components?
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: have you ever seen open source drivers for a video card?
[07/25/2005 02:44 PM] Me: exactly
[07/25/2005 02:45 PM] Me: just like the gaming industry
[07/25/2005 02:45 PM] samcvey: absolutely
[07/25/2005 02:45 PM] Me: some at least
[07/25/2005 02:45 PM] samcvey: Look at Linux video card support
[07/25/2005 02:45 PM] Me: Valve (the creators of the Half Life series) has an entire source SDK with full documentation and unlimited resources
[07/25/2005 02:46 PM] Me: that's what we are using to make our mod
[07/25/2005 02:46 PM] Me: idSoftware has done the same thing with Doom 3 engine
[07/25/2005 02:47 PM] Me: i can't even imagine how much creativity is being promoted between the two, with people making mods and using the resources those two companies have given them, that's the kind of stuff that makes people want to go into computer science, yet even Bill Gates, one of the smartest people in the world fails to realize it
[07/25/2005 02:47 PM] samcvey: so someone is trying to contact our IP address on port 26310. Do you know what that is used for? Could it be a game server? Could it be Limewire?
[07/25/2005 02:48 PM] Me: how many times do you think he has actually asked a computer science major why they think more of their friends aren't going into it?
[07/25/2005 02:48 PM] Me: no, no game server, and i don't use limewire
[07/25/2005 02:51 PM] samcvey: What does Doom and Q3 use?
[07/25/2005 02:52 PM] Me: hm?
[07/25/2005 02:52 PM] Me: oh
[07/25/2005 02:52 PM] Me: not those
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] Me: q3 is 27960
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] Me: doom is 27666
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] samcvey: Check the router and see if we have that port defined
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] samcvey: your brother uses limewire
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] Me: yeah
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] Me: could be him
[07/25/2005 02:53 PM] Me: not sure
[07/25/2005 02:54 PM] Me: i have to post on this blog after the article

[07/29/2005 02:52 PM] samcvey: Sometimes they are just "OEM" versions that come in a static-free bag and nothing else.
[07/29/2005 02:54 PM] Me: yeah that's what i got
[07/29/2005 02:55 PM] Me: i didn't know that's what OEM meant but the motherboard included 8 SATA cables and 1x40-pin and 1x80pin
[07/29/2005 02:55 PM] samcvey: I've bought many of them, should be no problem.
[07/29/2005 02:55 PM] Me: no chipset fan
[07/29/2005 02:56 PM] samcvey: Original Equipment Manufacturer. That means that computer makers like Dell would buy them that way.
[07/29/2005 02:56 PM] samcvey: Do you still have that silver motherboard? It had a chipset fan on it.
[07/29/2005 02:56 PM] Me: i don't understand this thing has everything on board including firewire but they give me like 3 PCI slot cards
[07/29/2005 02:57 PM] Me: there is no where to put the fan, it has this big steal tube with a heat sink that says "Fanless Design" on it
[07/29/2005 02:57 PM] Me: and yes i did save the fan like you said and the rest is in the trash
[07/29/2005 02:57 PM] samcvey: Oh then they have figured out how to cool it otherwise
[07/29/2005 02:58 PM] Me: this CPU fan is beastly
[07/29/2005 02:58 PM] samcvey: are you assembling it today?
[07/29/2005 02:58 PM] Me: and i am gonna have to go to frys and get a converter for the 20-pin main power
[07/29/2005 02:58 PM] Me: no case
[07/29/2005 02:59 PM] Me: we can put the cpu and mem in when you get home
[07/29/2005 02:59 PM] Me: because i am going to be somewhat limited on time
[07/29/2005 02:59 PM] samcvey: yes, but you can put chip, fan,  and memory on mb
[07/29/2005 02:59 PM] samcvey: board has 24-pin?
[07/29/2005 03:00 PM] Me: yes
[07/29/2005 03:00 PM] samcvey: power supplky doesnt?
[07/29/2005 03:00 PM] Me: we might have problems with the memory
[07/29/2005 03:00 PM] Me: it isn't on the qualified vendors list
[07/29/2005 03:00 PM] samcvey: that shouldnt matter
[07/29/2005 03:01 PM] Me: there is 1
[07/29/2005 03:01 PM] Me: kingston is on there like 20 times
[07/29/2005 03:02 PM] Me: can you buy external SATA drives?
[07/29/2005 03:02 PM] samcvey: I believe so why?
[07/29/2005 03:02 PM] Me: it comes with an external SATA PCI card
[07/29/2005 03:04 PM] Me: 8 SATA and 4 IDE all at once with Raid
[07/29/2005 03:04 PM] Me: II
[07/29/2005 03:04 PM] samcvey: They make SATA CD/DVD drives now
[07/29/2005 03:05 PM] Me: which only makes sense is SATA is all you have
[07/29/2005 03:05 PM] Me: that's another thing i will need
[07/29/2005 03:05 PM] Me: or you will
[07/29/2005 03:05 PM] Me: i didn't buy a CD/DVD drive
[07/29/2005 03:06 PM] samcvey: no problem they are cheap.
[07/29/2005 03:06 PM] Me: so i am gonna need a monitor and a drive
[07/29/2005 03:06 PM] Me: i might as well get a SATA
[07/29/2005 03:06 PM] Me: i bought the one in my machine now
[07/29/2005 03:06 PM] Me: but that was a replacement for the little incident
[07/29/2005 03:11 PM] samcvey: yup. Thye had $199 17-inch in today.
[07/29/2005 03:12 PM] Me: oOo
[07/29/2005 03:13 PM] Me: yeah my power supply is only 20-pin
[07/29/2005 03:14 PM] samcvey: I'd wait til it shows up and se. Last one I bought had a little 4-pin thing that attached to the 20-pin connector.
[07/29/2005 03:14 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/29/2005 03:20 PM] Me: this thing even has a game/midi port on board

[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] Me: i concur
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] samcvey: Have you tried Cox Webmail?
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] Me: i could try it
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] Me: webmail works
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] samcvey: not the server then
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] samcvey: perhaps you are blocking pop3?
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] Me: but the firewall lets everything go through for the outlook application
[08/01/2005 11:06 AM] samcvey: then why isnt outlook receiving mail?
[08/01/2005 11:07 AM] Me: i turned off my firewall and got the same results
[08/01/2005 11:07 AM] Me: now by turned off i mean exited completely
[08/01/2005 11:11 AM] samcvey: just sent you a test email

[08/01/2005 11:39 AM] Me: i already tried
[08/01/2005 11:39 AM] Me: the firewall is on on my laptop
[08/01/2005 11:39 AM] samcvey: Check your Outlook server settings?
[08/01/2005 11:40 AM] samcvey: Can you see it trying to connect?
[08/01/2005 11:40 AM] Me: yeah

[08/01/2005 11:40 AM] samcvey: Do you get a message?

[08/01/2005 11:43 AM] Me: outlook could not connect to the outgoing mail server
[08/01/2005 11:43 AM] Me: the problem could be your ssl or port settings for the outgoing server
[08/01/2005 11:43 AM] Me: what does that mean?
[08/01/2005 11:43 AM] samcvey: Looks like SMTP and POP protocols are blocked 
[08/01/2005 11:44 AM] samcvey: you are hopefully not trying to use SSL and the SMTP port should be the default
[08/01/2005 11:44 AM] Me: it is
[08/01/2005 11:44 AM] samcvey: Curios that you can't go either direction
[08/01/2005 11:44 AM] Me: i have never messed with that stuff

[08/01/2005 11:44 AM] samcvey: Did you try a reboot without the firewall?
[08/01/2005 11:45 AM] Me: i could
[08/01/2005 11:45 AM] samcvey: also try ping pop.west.cox.net

[08/01/2005 11:46 AM] Me: they seem to work for you though so you can have them
[08/01/2005 11:46 AM] samcvey: can't use them for data backup?
[08/01/2005 11:47 AM] Me: i can burn about 30-60 percent of what i am trying to burn before they stop working
[08/01/2005 11:48 AM] samcvey: Look at microwaves while youre there. max 700W is a smaller one
[08/01/2005 11:49 AM] Me: yeah kind of a bad day to go
[08/01/2005 11:49 AM] Me: no sales
[08/01/2005 11:50 AM] Me: but i have to get more DVDs and possibly a SATA DVD burner
[08/01/2005 11:50 AM] Me: you said they were around the same price as the regular ATA burners right?
[08/01/2005 11:50 AM] samcvey: probably not.
[08/01/2005 11:50 AM] Me: you think they are more?
[08/01/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: most likely.
[08/01/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday ads are all good today.
[08/01/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: I have the Friday ad
[08/01/2005 11:51 AM] samcvey: but they are all hanging in the store
[08/01/2005 11:51 AM] Me: really? i thought they reset the sales on sunday
[08/01/2005 11:52 AM] samcvey: Nope. all weekend ads good til Tuesday
[08/01/2005 11:52 AM] Me: awesome
[08/01/2005 11:54 AM] Me: i am having problems with this laptop
[08/01/2005 11:54 AM] Me: i converted the hard drive to NTFS
[08/01/2005 11:54 AM] Me: now i am getting error when i try to delete files like "Cannot read from source file or disk"
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] Me: that's probably not a good thing is it?
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] samcvey: Did conversion complete without errors?
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] Me: yes
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] samcvey: Never seen that
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] samcvey: Might be good to just rebuild it
[08/01/2005 11:55 AM] Me: yeah maybe
[08/01/2005 11:56 AM] Me: its not like i have any important documents
[08/01/2005 11:56 AM] Me: it just takes time to set up
[08/01/2005 11:56 AM] Me: but the weird thing is, i am positive i will be able to delete the files after i reboot
[08/01/2005 11:57 AM] samcvey: is it possible that what youre trying to delete is in use?
[08/01/2005 11:57 AM] Me: its a shortcut
[08/01/2005 11:57 AM] Me: on the desktop
[08/01/2005 11:57 AM] Me: there are 3 of them
[08/01/2005 11:58 AM] samcvey: shortcut for what?
[08/01/2005 11:58 AM] Me: i don't know how they got there, i updated mozilla and suddenly there were 4 and i was able to delete one
[08/01/2005 11:58 AM] Me: and now i get that same error for the other 3
[08/01/2005 12:00 PM] samcvey: going to lunch. want me to look for anything in the frys ad?

[08/18/2005 10:08 AM] Me: all of them
[08/18/2005 10:09 AM] samcvey: from my machine or tapes?
[08/18/2005 10:09 AM] Me: from the machine
[08/18/2005 10:09 AM] Me: when andrew puts the cap on the camera like 10 times over the course of 8 videos
[08/18/2005 10:09 AM] samcvey: good. need to recapture tham at higher res
[08/18/2005 10:09 AM] Me: the tape has a limit on what res they can be captured at though
[08/18/2005 10:10 AM] Me: aren't vhs only like 480 by 640?
[08/18/2005 10:10 AM] samcvey: its more a matter of disk space and frame rate
[08/18/2005 10:10 AM] samcvey: vhs is analog, so that measure doesnt make sense
[08/18/2005 10:11 AM] samcvey: 500 lines on atv is more like it
[08/18/2005 10:11 AM] samcvey: a tv
[08/18/2005 10:11 AM] Me: ah i see
[08/18/2005 10:12 AM] Me: so this computer it definitely faster
[08/18/2005 10:12 AM] samcvey: i hope so
[08/18/2005 10:12 AM] Me: when it is ripping the plextor SATA drive is about a 3rd faster then the other one
[08/18/2005 10:12 AM] samcvey: all your devices working?
[08/18/2005 10:13 AM] Me: encoding takes about half the time of my laptop
[08/18/2005 10:13 AM] Me: uhhh not the second firewire i keep forgetting to look at that
[08/18/2005 10:13 AM] samcvey: no problem running 32-bit win on a 64-bit machine?
[08/18/2005 10:14 AM] Me: then again, all the USB devices don't shot up in device manager until i plug them in, i should have 10 and only 6 show up until i plug in more
[08/18/2005 10:14 AM] Me: yes i am
[08/18/2005 10:14 AM] Me: so windows won't be able to take full advantage of the 64 bit stuff
[08/18/2005 10:14 AM] samcvey: of course
[08/18/2005 10:14 AM] Me: is there anything other then windows that runs at 64 bit?
[08/18/2005 10:15 AM] samcvey: linux
[08/18/2005 10:15 AM] Me: they better be reverse compatible with my old games once the world converts over to 64 bit
[08/18/2005 10:15 AM] samcvey: that's the only other choice on an intel-like chip
[08/18/2005 10:15 AM] Me: i c
[08/18/2005 10:15 AM] Me: i am very happy with this hard drive
[08/18/2005 10:16 AM] Me: it is pretty fast
[08/18/2005 10:16 AM] Me: and lots of extra space
[08/18/2005 10:16 AM] samcvey: good. how's your old machine? what does it need?
[08/18/2005 10:16 AM] Me: eventually i would like to get another one and 2 seagate 500GB 7200.9 and RAID them together
[08/18/2005 10:16 AM] Me: it still needs drivers
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] samcvey: via or nvidia?
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] Me: so i will fix that up and we can move it into chase's room for him to start messing with
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] Me: nvidia
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] Me: and ati stuff
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] samcvey: ok how about hardware?
[08/18/2005 10:17 AM] samcvey: monitor, keyboard, mouse, cd drive?

[08/18/2005 10:19 AM] samcvey: so just a monitor?
[08/18/2005 10:19 AM] Me: yup
[08/18/2005 10:19 AM] Me: since i refuse to more backwards and buy matching 17" for myself and sell you my 18" lets just find him 1 cheepo 17"
[08/18/2005 10:20 AM] Me: they are getting pretty cheap in the fry's ads
[08/18/2005 10:20 AM] Me: 150 or so
[08/18/2005 10:20 AM] samcvey: 179 is the lowest ive seen for my hyundais
[08/18/2005 10:20 AM] Me: good good, we might be able to find something cheaper on newegg but then we have to pay for shipping and wait
[08/18/2005 10:21 AM] Me: my friends and i might take a trip to frys again today, want me to pick you up one?
[08/18/2005 10:21 AM] samcvey: not on sale, unfortunately
[08/18/2005 10:21 AM] Me: ok

[08/18/2005 10:22 AM] Me: what did you find?
[08/18/2005 10:22 AM] samcvey: yup, mom found a ge black 700 watt $78 no shipping
[08/18/2005 10:22 AM] Me: wow
[08/18/2005 10:22 AM] Me: nice deal
[08/18/2005 10:24 AM] Me: wow my receiver is coming today
[08/18/2005 10:24 AM] Me: i can't wait to play with that
[08/18/2005 10:24 AM] samcvey: what model?
[08/18/2005 10:24 AM] Me: 4 extra bucks for 3 days shipping as opposed to 5-7
[08/18/2005 10:25 AM] Me: i couldn't find many reviews but the ones i did find were all posative except for no phono input
[08/18/2005 10:25 AM] Me: JVC RX-D201S
[08/18/2005 10:25 AM] Me: darnit

[08/18/2005 10:26 AM] Me: yes
[08/18/2005 10:27 AM] Me: the sony one that i found looked nice but i found like 3 reviews and all of them were bad
[08/18/2005 10:27 AM] Me: supposedly in the higher volumes it was very lacking because of the extra 6.1 feature
[08/18/2005 10:28 AM] Me: didn't sound so hot but i think this JVC will be really nice
[08/18/2005 10:28 AM] samcvey: has a usb input
[08/18/2005 10:28 AM] Me: yeah i thought that was weird
[08/18/2005 10:28 AM] Me: now we do need to figure out if i can get insurance up there
[08/18/2005 10:28 AM] samcvey: ?? you can play your pc filoes right into it
[08/18/2005 10:29 AM] Me: should be interesting to try that out
[08/18/2005 10:29 AM] Me: yeah should be cool
[08/18/2005 10:29 AM] Me: i might just use both the optical and usb input depending on what i am doing
[08/18/2005 10:29 AM] Me: Doom 3 and Half Life 2 both support surround sound so i can wait to try it

[08/18/2005 11:37 AM] Me: do they?

[08/18/2005 11:38 AM] Me: that's perfect

[08/18/2005 11:38 AM] Me: like i could "Safely Remove" my plextor DVD drive
[08/18/2005 11:38 AM] samcvey: thats a good feature
[08/18/2005 11:39 AM] Me: while windows is booted even because it won't mess up the IDE controller because its not IDE, it all makes sense now
[08/18/2005 11:39 AM] Me: if an ide drive is removed while your computer is on it could ruin the controller rendering your motherboard useless, i love SATA
[08/18/2005 11:40 AM] Me: i'll have to look at frys to see if they have any enclosures

[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] samcvey: One connects to the school LAN
[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] samcvey: The other is your own network
[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] Me: like i get internet on my laptop through my desktop
[08/26/2005 03:52 PM] Me: i just don't get any computers in the workgroup
[08/26/2005 03:53 PM] samcvey: So you turn on Internet sharing for the one connected to your laptop
[08/26/2005 03:53 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:53 PM] samcvey: You should see both your workgroup and the school's
[08/26/2005 03:54 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 03:54 PM] samcvey: did you have to reconfigure your desktop to access the school's network?
[08/26/2005 03:54 PM] Me: no
[08/26/2005 03:54 PM] samcvey: do you see a workgroup for the school network?
[08/26/2005 03:55 PM] Me: no
[08/26/2005 03:55 PM] samcvey: did you get instructions from the school on how to config your computer?
[08/26/2005 03:55 PM] Me: no
[08/26/2005 03:56 PM] samcvey: you should ask. maybe they have a domain set up
[08/26/2005 03:56 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 03:56 PM] samcvey: Can you see both your computers in the same workgroup?
[08/26/2005 03:56 PM] Me: i will call after i get the router set up maybe that will make things easier
[08/26/2005 03:57 PM] samcvey: what router?
[08/26/2005 03:57 PM] Me: the one i made Eric buy a hile back
[08/26/2005 03:57 PM] samcvey: oh. will you put that in front of boht computers?
[08/26/2005 03:57 PM] samcvey: do you each have an ethernet jack?
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: but there are 3 computers
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] samcvey: then plug your two into the router and they will have equal access
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: and then other people can come and just plug in and makes it easier
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] Me: exactly
[08/26/2005 03:58 PM] samcvey: and you dont have to have the desktop on for the laptop to work
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] samcvey: solved?
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] Me: i hope
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] samcvey: you also have wireless right?
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] Me: not on my desktop
[08/26/2005 03:59 PM] samcvey: of course. what speed is your ethernet network
[08/26/2005 04:00 PM] Me: gigabit

[08/26/2005 04:00 PM] samcvey: really? Thats great.
[08/26/2005 04:00 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 04:00 PM] samcvey: ok anything else?
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] Me: so will the router be able to support the gigabit lan?
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] samcvey: no. not unless you get a gigabit router
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] Me: don't you remember the one we got him
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] Me: the netgear i think
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] samcvey: yes. NetGear wireless right?
[08/26/2005 04:01 PM] Me: yes
[08/26/2005 04:02 PM] samcvey: max 100MB
[08/26/2005 04:02 PM] Me: i doubt once everyone plugs in that it is really going to run over 100mbits
[08/26/2005 04:02 PM] Me: and its still going to max out at higher speeds then cox permits
[08/26/2005 04:02 PM] samcvey: it should if the whole network supports that speed
[08/26/2005 04:03 PM] Me: yeah
[08/26/2005 04:03 PM] samcvey: why does cox matter?
[08/26/2005 04:03 PM] Me: just comparing to the set up at home
[08/26/2005 04:04 PM] samcvey: our cable modem is around 4MB download, 1.5 MB upload
[08/26/2005 04:04 PM] Me: yeah i know
[08/26/2005 04:05 PM] samcvey: go to one of those speed checking sites and see what you get

[09/07/2005 04:23 PM] Steve McVey: just win explorer and WMP?

[10/27/2005 01:18 PM] Me: yeah because i thought it would help
[10/27/2005 01:19 PM] Me: it must just be a combination of problems

[11/01/2005 10:10 AM] Steve McVey: shouldnt
[11/01/2005 10:10 AM] Steve McVey: i dont notice any issues
[11/01/2005 10:10 AM] Me: it takes a pretty long time
[11/01/2005 10:10 AM] Me: could it just be my lack of memory?
[11/01/2005 10:10 AM] Me: how come that would slow my computer down?
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Steve McVey: you still have 1 gig right
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Me: i have 512
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Me: because i haven't got the other one back yet
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Steve McVey: oh, could be  memory then
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Steve McVey: what else do you have loaded?
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Me: but why would it slow it down that much?
[11/01/2005 10:11 AM] Steve McVey: paging
[11/01/2005 10:12 AM] Me: hardly anything, i have the shortest loading list i have ever seen
[11/01/2005 10:12 AM] Me: anywho more importantly
[11/01/2005 10:12 AM] Me: my car...
[11/01/2005 10:12 AM] Steve McVey: yes?
[11/01/2005 10:13 AM] Me: i know that it is probably the speed limit of going through mountains that caused this, but the gas was a little over 3/4 full, when i got to flag it was a bit under 1/4
[11/01/2005 10:13 AM] Steve McVey: sounds about right
[11/01/2005 10:13 AM] Steve McVey: you should get about 320 per tank
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Steve McVey: an there was already 180 on it i believe
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Me: the usage just doesn't make sense, i know its a small car and i was taking it easy going up, and its less efficient at higher speeds but shouldn't i have gotten more out of it?
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Me: oh
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Me: well maybe it is right then, it is a small tank
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Me: only 14.2 i think
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Steve McVey: how many miles on this tank? (trip odometer)
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Me: i will have to go check
[11/01/2005 10:14 AM] Steve McVey: 14 gallons X 30 mpg = 
[11/01/2005 10:15 AM] Me: 420
[11/01/2005 10:15 AM] Steve McVey: but you normally dont use the last two gallons
[11/01/2005 10:15 AM] Me: ok
[11/01/2005 10:15 AM] Me: i'm sure its fine because its about 120 miles from our house
[11/01/2005 10:16 AM] Steve McVey: so you should be sitting at about 300 miles, which is great if you still have 1/4 tank left
[11/01/2005 10:16 AM] Me: and going up the mountains at a higher speed will cause a little decrease in efficiency
[11/01/2005 10:16 AM] Me: yeah
[11/01/2005 10:16 AM] Steve McVey: true
[11/01/2005 10:16 AM] Me: i'm sure its fine then

[11/01/2005 10:19 AM] Me: good through the 29th

[11/01/2005 08:18 PM] Me: no it is still pretty slow, i find it hard to believe that it could all be because of missing some memory
[11/01/2005 08:18 PM] Steve McVey: is your hard drive running constantly?
[11/01/2005 08:18 PM] Me: its slow even when it is just blinking every few seconds

[11/01/2005 08:19 PM] Me: i first noticed it when i installed that new version of spy sweeper
[11/01/2005 08:19 PM] Steve McVey: stop spy sweeper and see if it changes

[12/05/2005 04:27 PM] Steve McVey: that's what killed apple the first time
[12/05/2005 04:28 PM] Me: really?
[12/05/2005 04:28 PM] Me: maybe they finally realized that the only reason people buy apple is because of the OS
[12/05/2005 04:28 PM] Steve McVey: Apple II and Apple III were all closed systems while IBM was selling like craazy because of open specs
[12/05/2005 04:28 PM] Me: oh
[12/05/2005 04:28 PM] Me: hmm
[12/05/2005 04:29 PM] Me: i have the OS X86

[12/05/2005 04:29 PM] Me: its insteresting
[12/05/2005 04:36 PM] Me: hey i have a question, why would a company like Asus improve one aspect of their motherboard like front side bus speed, but then lower the features on everything else like supported SATA?
[12/05/2005 04:37 PM] Steve McVey: cost and selling price like everything else
[12/05/2005 04:38 PM] Me: hmmm but i want a board that does everything, i wish i could fill up all 8 SATA ports i have, and eventually maybe i will, i would never give up that option for a little extra FSB
[12/05/2005 04:42 PM] Me: and Dell has really gone downhill, every since they caught their commercial guy doing drugs, i hate pre-installs, i was on the phone with them for 3 hours trying to find drivers for my friends computer, the lady that was helping me couldn't just give me drivers from their database that they should have, she eventually just resorted to using google to get me Dell drivers, absolutely pathetic

[01/23/2006 07:41 PM] Steve McVey: yes?
[01/23/2006 07:43 PM] Me: my CS teacher made a mistake today
[01/23/2006 07:43 PM] Me: that class is easy
[01/23/2006 07:43 PM] Me: i could teach it
[01/23/2006 07:43 PM] Me: but i'll get and A in it first
[01/23/2006 07:44 PM] Me: my teacher hardcoded 2.54 the conversion from inches to centimeters
[01/23/2006 07:44 PM] Me: he put it right into the equation instead of making it a constant
[01/23/2006 07:48 PM] Steve McVey: still works
[01/23/2006 07:48 PM] Steve McVey: in Java?
[01/23/2006 07:48 PM] Me: yes
[01/23/2006 07:48 PM] Me: but its not proper
[01/23/2006 07:49 PM] Me: it should have been declared as a constant double then use the name of the constant in the code
[01/23/2006 07:50 PM] Me: if the final recipient of the code needs to make changes for example wants the exact measurement and wants 10 decimals instead of 2 (in 2.54) then they should be able to change the constant
[01/23/2006 07:50 PM] Me: and what if the new programmer wants to convert to a different unit
[01/23/2006 07:50 PM] Me: organization is one of the most important things my C++ professor taught me
[01/23/2006 07:55 PM] Steve McVey: tall true. he probably wanted to keep it simple for beginners
[01/23/2006 07:55 PM] Me: this guy asked why the teacher put int in front of the variable name when he has been explaining that's how to define variables for the last 3 days
[01/23/2006 07:56 PM] Me: i got my packet for my job today, a little pen flashlight and a usb drive and usb netgear network adapter

[01/23/2006 07:58 PM] Steve McVey: pocket protector?
[01/23/2006 07:59 PM] Me: no should i get one?
[01/23/2006 08:00 PM] Me: i want to get an ethernet loopback keychain and crossover keychain
[01/23/2006 08:00 PM] Steve McVey: only if you want to be taken seriously and et chicks
[01/23/2006 08:01 PM] Me: is the 127.0.0.1 loopback use the ethernet controller?
[01/23/2006 08:01 PM] Me: *does the
[01/23/2006 08:01 PM] Me: haha i don't need a pocket protector to get chix
[01/23/2006 08:02 PM] Steve McVey: no, just loops back
[01/23/2006 08:02 PM] Me: yeah so even if there was no controller i could still use my server from 127.0.0.1 correct?
[01/23/2006 08:03 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[01/23/2006 08:03 PM] Me: yeah see my friend jeremy thought that pinging 127.0.0.1 was a response from the ethernet controller
[01/23/2006 08:04 PM] Me: but since its not really, it wouldn't be able to tell us that the ethernet controller is working
[01/23/2006 08:05 PM] Steve McVey: think thats right
[01/23/2006 08:06 PM] Me: if i disable all connections theoretically my computer is not supposed to use any controller, and pinging 127.0.0.1 still shows up positive
[01/23/2006 08:07 PM] Steve McVey: yes, i believe because tcp/ip is built in
[01/23/2006 08:08 PM] Me: to the os

[01/25/2006 01:56 PM] Steve McVey: yes, we all know that, but it is always there in every O/S, so you must learn it
[01/25/2006 01:56 PM] Steve McVey: Can be used with just a console and no gui
[01/25/2006 01:56 PM] Me: i hate it so much, the worst part about it is you can't change lines or character positions by using the arrow keys
[01/25/2006 01:57 PM] Steve McVey: yup....
[01/25/2006 01:57 PM] Me: its terrible

[01/25/2006 01:58 PM] Me: like typing the commands manually because i already know linux
[01/25/2006 01:58 PM] Me: he wants us to print the script file which contains all the output from the command prompt

[02/03/2006 09:29 PM] Me: comes out to exactly 57.60 dollars
[02/03/2006 09:31 PM] Me: there is a section for Before-Tax deductions, and After-Tax deductions and they are completely empty, and Employer Paid Benefits has an item 'Wrk Comp' - $.46 but the total is still 57.60
[02/03/2006 09:33 PM] Steve McVey: emplioyer pay work comp insurance
[02/03/2006 09:34 PM] Me: why are they not taking out 18 percent in federal and state taxes?  I am single and 1 allowance
[02/03/2006 09:34 PM] Me: so why isn't there any deductions? am i going to have to give it all back at the end of the year?
[02/03/2006 09:34 PM] Steve McVey: too little to tax
[02/03/2006 09:34 PM] Me: so you mean once i get more pay checks they will start taking it out of the YTD?
[02/03/2006 09:34 PM] Steve McVey: much better toi keep it all
[02/03/2006 09:35 PM] Me: yeah i'd love to keep it all, but i'd rather the government doesn't ask for it back at the end of the year
[02/03/2006 09:35 PM] Me: will they start taking it out of the year to date in future pay checks?
[02/03/2006 09:41 PM] Steve McVey: wont be a problem
[02/03/2006 09:41 PM] Steve McVey: if its too small to take out, you owe no tax
[02/03/2006 09:41 PM] Me: i c, so the total amount earned doesn't matter, just each individual pay check correct?
[02/03/2006 09:43 PM] Steve McVey: its doubtful youd make 100k with 56 paychecks
[02/03/2006 09:43 PM] Me: so they are never going to tax me?
[02/03/2006 09:44 PM] Me: that doesn't make sense, if they have never taxed me in the past, why do i fill out a w2 every year?
[02/03/2006 09:44 PM] Me: what money am i getting back with the W2?
[02/03/2006 09:44 PM] Steve McVey: thats to tell them how many exemptions. they dont know how much youre going to make
[02/03/2006 09:46 PM] Me: i still don't understand, in the past there has always been deductions, are you saying i should never have had any paychecks ever taxed at all period?
[02/03/2006 09:47 PM] Steve McVey: nope. just saying that $56 isn't enough for them to take taxes out.
[02/03/2006 09:47 PM] Steve McVey: if you get a $56 paycheck every week, you'll owe no taxes
[02/03/2006 09:47 PM] Me: i c
[02/03/2006 09:48 PM] Me: that's all i needed to know, they tax depending on amount earned per paycheck and not expected amount overall
[02/03/2006 09:49 PM] Me: so next week when i make $160 dollars i'll probably see 28 dollars deducted
[02/03/2006 09:50 PM] Steve McVey: thats the idea
[02/03/2006 09:50 PM] Me: ok i still need to file for tax return, mom gave me all the stuff, i am going to use turbo tax online again
[02/03/2006 09:51 PM] Steve McVey: ok. i can review it for you

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Steve McVey): Mon Feb 27 11:43:58 2006
[02/27/2006 11:44 AM] Me: What video card did you get?
[02/27/2006 11:44 AM] Steve McVey: The new AIW 2006 dition with X1300 chip - $200.
[02/27/2006 11:44 AM] Steve McVey: 320 fps in urban terror
[02/27/2006 11:45 AM] Me: noice
[02/27/2006 11:45 AM] Me: my CS teacher cheated me out of 9 points on my last project assignment
[02/27/2006 11:45 AM] Me: i should have gotten a 13/10 when instead he gave me a 4/10
[02/27/2006 11:45 AM] Steve McVey: guess i can sell my x800xl when i get it back from repair/replace
[02/27/2006 11:45 AM] Me: yeah that's true
[02/27/2006 11:47 AM] Me: but i have all the proof i need to get him to reconsider my grade, i have the last modified date on all the files, they show up at Feb 16 when the project was due the 17th, so why would i finish all of it if i was going to turn it in on monday anyways, the only reason i printed out a second copy was just incase he couldn't find the first one
[02/27/2006 11:47 AM] Me: how annoying, i could teach this class
[02/27/2006 11:48 AM] Steve McVey: just be sure to approach in a respectful way...
[02/27/2006 11:49 AM] Me: yeah i'm not going to tell him i could do his job if they hired undergrads
[02/27/2006 11:51 AM] Me: yay we are finally instantiating a form woopdeedoo
[02/27/2006 11:52 AM] Steve McVey: Just take this as an opportunity to get a solid A and do whatever extra work you can to get ahead
[02/27/2006 11:53 AM] Me: i'm trying to do extra work, i always turn in my projects 3 days early for 2 points extra credit, now he ripped me off, i'm angry
[02/27/2006 11:53 AM] Steve McVey: don't be angry until you know he did it on purpose
[02/27/2006 11:55 AM] Me: how could he not have, he makes us make a script file which logs everything you do in linux the command is "script", it has the exact date when the script is created right at the top, why would i completely finish the project and turn it in 3 days late?
[02/27/2006 11:55 AM] Steve McVey: assumption...
[02/27/2006 11:56 AM] Me: i'm going to talk to him after class, i'll try to be nice
[02/27/2006 11:57 AM] Steve McVey: or you could tear him apart in your first statement. That would get him on your side.
[02/27/2006 12:02 PM] Me: i want an AIW x1900
[02/27/2006 12:03 PM] Me: i need another hard drive first to RAID 1, turns out i would have to rebuild my computer completely because it doesn't copy everything
[02/27/2006 12:03 PM] Me: unless i had a hard drive imaging program that supports raid, does ghost?

[02/28/2006 08:37 AM] Me: Free time
[02/28/2006 08:37 AM] *** Auto-response from Steve McVey: I am currently away from the computer.

[02/28/2006 08:42 AM] Steve McVey: doing wat?
[02/28/2006 08:42 AM] Me: what?

[02/28/2006 08:42 AM] Me: building websites
[02/28/2006 08:43 AM] Me: this guy i met through a frat meeting works there, he says his boss has a lot of clients lined up but hes looking for more programmers
[02/28/2006 08:44 AM] Steve McVey: worth a look
[02/28/2006 08:44 AM] Me: from what i understand he already has a nice back end on the process, we just have to build the front end to interface with his databases
[02/28/2006 08:44 AM] Me: i might have to quit my job at resnet if i get that job
[02/28/2006 08:45 AM] Steve McVey: of course, you may have deadlines which you dont have now
[02/28/2006 08:45 AM] Me: true, i have never been in that sort of work environment before, i will have a lot of questions in the interview
[02/28/2006 08:46 AM] Me: will you check over my resume before/if i have an interview?
[02/28/2006 08:46 AM] Me: this fraternity is interesting too
 alpha kappa psi, or akpsi
[02/28/2006 08:47 AM] Steve McVey: ok i will.
[02/28/2006 08:47 AM] Me: its international and similar to delta sigma pi, its a business frat but unlike their rival they believe they can help make business leaders is all fields, not just the business field
[02/28/2006 08:48 AM] Me: i might join, its not a social frat although they do some social activities together, and they attend business meetings together
[02/28/2006 08:49 AM] Steve McVey: no keggers then?
[02/28/2006 08:49 AM] Me: no probably not

[03/02/2006 02:08 PM] Me: i have more questions about taxes
[03/02/2006 02:13 PM] Steve McVey: yes?
[03/02/2006 02:16 PM] Me: they are still not taking a percentage out of my pay checks
[03/02/2006 02:16 PM] Me: will you try to explain to me what the percentage is that i have to choose every time i apply for a job?
[03/02/2006 02:16 PM] Me: its like 15%, 18%, up to 34%
[03/02/2006 02:17 PM] Me: i usually choose 18%
[03/02/2006 02:17 PM] Me: so doesn't that mean they should be taking 18% out of my pay checks?
[03/02/2006 02:19 PM] Steve McVey: 18% of your Federal tax withheld for AZ state taxes
[03/02/2006 02:19 PM] Me: ok so why would they not take that percent out?
[03/02/2006 02:19 PM] Steve McVey: so if you make $100 and fed tackes 20, az would take an additional 18% of $20 or 3.60.
[03/02/2006 02:20 PM] Me: well there are no taxes being taken
[03/02/2006 02:20 PM] Steve McVey: i would choose 15% since you are not likely to owe taxes at all.
[03/02/2006 02:21 PM] Steve McVey: because your pay is low enough that you would not owe any taxes at that rate
[03/02/2006 02:21 PM] Me: why have they always taken out taxes before?
[03/02/2006 02:21 PM] Steve McVey: you mean marriott?
[03/02/2006 02:22 PM] Me: and safeway
[03/02/2006 02:22 PM] Steve McVey: you made more money there didnt you?
[03/02/2006 02:22 PM] Me: yeah
[03/02/2006 02:22 PM] Me: and i am making even more here
[03/02/2006 02:22 PM] Me: another question does online banking only work during the weekday?
[03/02/2006 02:23 PM] Me: or do transactions go through over the weekend?
[03/02/2006 02:23 PM] Steve McVey: not sure. some merchants dont send them in over the weekend. are you missing something?
[03/02/2006 02:25 PM] Me: no this is so incredibly stupid, i have like 10 transactions that went through all on the 21, but they showed up in transactions pending since like the 16th, and i was so confused as to how much money i had in my account because the balance would change that i transferred funds back and fourth
[03/02/2006 02:25 PM] Me: so the tickes for cirque du solei finally showed up the 27th and i went under 54 cents because i thought it had already gone through earlier
[03/02/2006 02:26 PM] Me: now i am waiting on the phone
[03/02/2006 02:26 PM] Me: so the state taxes take 18 percent of the federal taxes?
[03/02/2006 02:28 PM] Steve McVey: correct
[03/02/2006 02:28 PM] Steve McVey: 21st was a tuesday, so they have gone through the next day.
[03/02/2006 02:28 PM] Me: so if i'm exempt from federal taxes for working on campus the state won't take any either?
[03/02/2006 02:29 PM] Steve McVey: Are you exempt? not sure about state. ask your employer.
[03/02/2006 02:29 PM] Me: no i mean the transactions were pending since the 15th and finally went through on the 21st
[03/02/2006 02:30 PM] Me: i could have sworn transactions could go through over the weekend, isn't that the entire point of online banking?
[03/02/2006 02:31 PM] Steve McVey: oh..20th was a holiday
[03/02/2006 02:32 PM] Steve McVey: dont know why they would be pending that long
[03/02/2006 02:32 PM] Steve McVey: usually just one day
[03/02/2006 02:32 PM] Me: so they don't do transactions on the weekend?
[03/02/2006 02:32 PM] Me: and the holiday added to that?
[03/02/2006 02:32 PM] Steve McVey: not sure, but probably dont get posted until monday
[03/02/2006 02:36 PM] Me: see the cirque du solei tickets were on the pending list since the 21 when i have over 2 hundred dollars in my checking account, that's when i was planning on buying them
[03/02/2006 02:36 PM] Me: then all the other transactions from before the 21st finally went through and i had to transfer over 100 dollars
[03/02/2006 02:37 PM] Me: well it took so long to move from pending that i transferred 100 dollars back to my savings not realizing that the tickets didn't go through
[03/02/2006 02:40 PM] Steve McVey: i see. did you call the bank?
[03/02/2006 02:48 PM] Me: i am
[03/02/2006 02:50 PM] Me: they will remove the fee
[03/02/2006 02:50 PM] Steve McVey: good.
[03/02/2006 02:50 PM] Me: this once
[03/02/2006 02:51 PM] Me: the thing is if i have a transaction pending after 3 days it will drop from pending completely
[03/02/2006 02:52 PM] Steve McVey: hmmm never seen that
[03/02/2006 02:52 PM] Me: then after they receive the receipt it will suddenly show up again under posted
[03/02/2006 02:52 PM] Steve McVey: so it is the merchant's fult?
[03/02/2006 02:52 PM] Me: so when they drop it its like they assume that it will never take place
[03/02/2006 02:52 PM] Steve McVey: fault?
[03/02/2006 02:53 PM] Me: yes the merchants fault for taking over 3 days to return the transaction to the bank
[03/02/2006 02:53 PM] Me: what i don't understand is how the 9 different merchants from 9 different transactions could all take so long
[03/02/2006 02:53 PM] Me: i guess because of the holiday they didn't return their transactions to the bank in time
[03/02/2006 02:53 PM] Me: or over the weekend at all!
[03/02/2006 02:54 PM] Me: so they all dropped after the holiday and suddenly showed up tuesday
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Steve McVey: well, why not keep a minimum $100 in checking to cover this possibility?
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Me: i do
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Me: but cirque du solei was over 100 dollars so i compensated by keeping over 250
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Steve McVey: guess youre covered then
[03/02/2006 02:57 PM] Me: so when all those transactions dropped because of the 3 day weekend i transferred 100 back without realizing the tickets haven't gone through yet
[03/02/2006 02:58 PM] Me: i bought the tickets the 21st and that transaction must have dropped too
[03/02/2006 02:58 PM] Me: and it just showed up today
[03/02/2006 03:00 PM] Me: so i think that's pretty stupid that they would drop transactions, it used to be 1 day, nows it 3, i think it should be until the merchant submits their receipts

[03/10/2006 01:09 PM] Me: Hi
[03/10/2006 01:11 PM] Me: back home?
[03/10/2006 01:11 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Me: i was wondering if maybe i could try your video card in my computer, try some different combinations with 2 cards
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Steve McVey: i will have an extra 800xl shortly
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Me: before you get rid of one
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Steve McVey: do they need to match?
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Me: not sure, that's what i want to try
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Steve McVey: do they have to have a bridge?
[03/10/2006 01:12 PM] Me: how much do you want for the 800xl?
[03/10/2006 01:13 PM] Me: not sure, bridges are for crossfire, but i am wondering if i could still use my TV on one screen then use my main card the 800xl for gaming on the primary screen
[03/10/2006 01:13 PM] Steve McVey: not sure on price. new one is $199 now, so if i can get 130- 150 that would be a good deal
[03/10/2006 01:13 PM] Me: and if windows is smart enough to extend to different cards
[03/10/2006 01:14 PM] Me: what do you think i could see my x600 for?
[03/10/2006 01:14 PM] Steve McVey: dont know, new models have gotten cheaper. check ebay.
[03/10/2006 01:14 PM] Me: maybe you could just sell mine instead sometime between the 17th and the 31st and i could buy your x800 with that money and a little extra for whatever the difference is
[03/10/2006 01:15 PM] Me: if i could sell mine for 100 then pay the extra 60?
[03/10/2006 01:15 PM] Me: which card do you have now?
[03/10/2006 01:15 PM] Me: an x1800?
[03/10/2006 01:15 PM] Me: they have an all in wonder x1900
[03/10/2006 01:16 PM] Me: but they are doing dual dvi and 512 ddr3 only 256 on the all in wonders its driving me nuts
[03/10/2006 01:16 PM] Me: *aren't doing dual dvi
[03/10/2006 01:16 PM] Me: its always dvi & vga
[03/10/2006 01:17 PM] Steve McVey: mine is called the 2006 edition PCI-E, which is an x1300 AIW
[03/10/2006 01:18 PM] Me: oh yeah i remember seeing that one
[03/10/2006 01:18 PM] Steve McVey: why do you need 512 if you arent doing high enough res to need it?
[03/10/2006 01:19 PM] Me: because if i want to support two monitors, and it would give my faster FPS in quake 4
[03/10/2006 01:19 PM] Steve McVey: i can do 2048x1536 on my 256MB card
[03/10/2006 01:19 PM] Me: i really want that new all in wonder but i want to wait until they make the x1900 XTX an all in wonder, they have the 1900 XT AIW but the new XTX is 512 ddr2 and beats the GeForce 7800 GT by a long shot
[03/10/2006 01:20 PM] Me: yeah but can you play video games with fast FPS at full settings in 1600x1200 res?
[03/10/2006 01:20 PM] Steve McVey: no, beacuse my monitor's native resolution is not that large
[03/10/2006 01:21 PM] Steve McVey: but if it were, i could do it
[03/10/2006 01:21 PM] Me: what frame rates are you getting? and isn't your x800XL 512ddr?
[03/10/2006 01:22 PM] Steve McVey: i have gotten 320 fps in Quake3/UrT at 1280x1024. I capped it at 120, which is plenty high.
[03/10/2006 01:24 PM] Me: yeah but what about quake 4 and battlefield 2?
[03/10/2006 01:25 PM] Me: i also get about a solid 350 at quake 3, but those are old games, i only get 15 in quake 4 and call of duty 2, i mean Eric gets a higher FPS then me in call of duty 2
[03/10/2006 01:26 PM] Steve McVey: dont know havent tried them

[03/10/2006 01:35 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[03/10/2006 01:36 PM] Me: you mean with the higher paying job?  i sent the guy an e-mail today with information on the websites i've made, i offered to send him a resume and more formal business letter if he would like.  my friend that works there is the one i sent this stuff too and hes going to forward it to his boss
[03/10/2006 01:37 PM] Steve McVey: oh, so still in progress

[03/17/2006 11:35 AM] Me: even from the start she expected too much, she said she wanted me to be her last boyfriend
[03/17/2006 11:35 AM] Steve McVey: well, that's flattering
[03/17/2006 11:35 AM] Me: i'm not ready for that kind of relationship, i am still looking for my perfect match, and the distance definitely wouldn't have permitted it
[03/17/2006 11:36 AM] Steve McVey: well, you never know. are you saying your perfect match has to be local?
[03/17/2006 11:37 AM] Me: i like that she liked me, but wow, "last boyfriend" is pretty serious
[03/17/2006 11:37 AM] Me: i like a lot of people, that i get along with really well and enjoy being around me, but i would never expect that from a female friend
[03/17/2006 11:38 AM] Steve McVey: agreed, but seems ashame to not explore the possibilities
[03/17/2006 11:39 AM] Me: i did, and i found a better match
[03/17/2006 11:41 AM] Me: 2 weeks ago i met a girl through a friend
[03/17/2006 11:42 AM] Me: and the instant i sat down and said hello to her i realized there was something wrong with my relationship with Amy, and it was more then just being long distance
[03/17/2006 11:44 AM] Steve McVey: well, gut instinct is a good indicator if your values system is intact
[03/17/2006 11:45 AM] Me: i know, so every day since the 6th we have spent a minimum of 3 hours together and loved every minute of it
[03/17/2006 11:45 AM] Me: and at first it was just friends
[03/17/2006 11:45 AM] Me: until this week we realized theres really something more
[03/17/2006 11:45 AM] Steve McVey: good, but recognize that you're in the initial excitement stage....
[03/17/2006 11:46 AM] Me: i understand
[03/17/2006 11:46 AM] Me: but what if there is a chance it will never wear down
[03/17/2006 11:47 AM] Me: well never is an infinite word and doesn't really make sense
[03/17/2006 11:47 AM] Me: but with Amy, it wore down for me pretty quick and i just kind of went with it because i invited her out here back when we were just friends
[03/17/2006 11:48 AM] Steve McVey: as long as you do what you think is right...
[03/17/2006 11:48 AM] Me: i think her visiting me as a friend would have been right
[03/17/2006 11:49 AM] Me: but that didn't happen
[03/17/2006 11:49 AM] Steve McVey: ok. gotta go. cya this evening.

[06/06/2006 10:53 AM] Me: Hi
[06/06/2006 10:53 AM] Me: I can confirm that when my laptop is connected to the wireless, my dads laptops wireless works
[06/06/2006 10:54 AM] Me: we have different IP addresses, and I am not sharing any connections
[06/06/2006 10:54 AM] Me: I kept hitting refresh, and as soon as I connected my laptop it started working, if i closed the lid, stopped working.  I have seen hardware do some pretty strange things but nothing like this
[06/06/2006 10:56 AM] Me: he has the latest drivers, i didn't flash it yet but i will try today.  I called technical support and got India and they went through a generic script with me, which was completely not helpful, so i am hoping i can get a supervisor next time
[06/06/2006 11:08 AM] Steve McVey: I would definitely flash it. Also, turn off the speed booster feature as they are proprietary and often cause issues.
[06/06/2006 11:25 AM] Me: i don't know where to turn speed booster on or off
[06/06/2006 11:27 AM] Me: the only component of the setup that seems to not work would be the PCMI adapter
[06/06/2006 11:27 AM] Me: because Corinne's and my connection work perfectly

[06/06/2006 01:23 PM] Me: i need a copy of Vmware ESX server
[06/06/2006 01:23 PM] Steve McVey: OK I don't have one. What for?
[06/06/2006 01:25 PM] Me: Well what i eventually want to do is set up a vmware server, that can run operating systems from a very low level virtual machine server, like command line version of vmware, so i want to have a virtual machine using gentuu underneath that for a file and apache server
[06/06/2006 01:26 PM] Me: then a windows server next to that for any windows applications that aren't compatible with apache, such as the microsoft ftp would be nice, and microsoft smtp is probably pretty reliable, and microsoft asp server, all stuff that comes with windows professional
[06/06/2006 01:26 PM] Me: maybe a quake server
[06/06/2006 01:26 PM] Me: on the windows machine that is
[06/06/2006 01:27 PM] Me: then next to that have a windows xp or vista install for applications like web design and just something to access the apache file server through a network drive or locally if its possible with vmware
[06/06/2006 01:28 PM] Me: then also a linux machine just to test software and cross platform with, like actually load up KDE or GNOME insterface
[06/06/2006 01:28 PM] Me: so 4 virtual machines total
[06/06/2006 01:29 PM] Steve McVey: Better buy some memory...
[06/06/2006 01:29 PM] Me: then i want a separate computer to access the web server and game server, a computer for gaming and local applications that i could back up to the server
[06/06/2006 01:30 PM] Me: yeah this isn't even something i'd be able to afford over the summer, i'm talking like 4 years and maybe i'll be hosting by then and be able to afford a T1 line
[06/06/2006 01:30 PM] Me: or set all this up back here and host for my dad in exchange get free office space
[06/06/2006 01:31 PM] Me: i just want it now, but i can't afford it now :-(
[06/06/2006 01:31 PM] Me: and Cox bandwidth at home can't support it anyways
[06/06/2006 01:33 PM] Steve McVey: Better talk to Jimmy John about how he makes money with his setup.
[06/06/2006 01:33 PM] Me: he said xml
[06/06/2006 01:33 PM] Me: "and you'll be writing your own pay checks"
[06/06/2006 01:35 PM] Me: so i would assume he interfaces that with a database server, i can imagine there is pretty good money there, i mean there are tons of applications for the new age databases and integrating them with website front ends that haven't even been touched on
[06/06/2006 01:36 PM] Me: even with that HVR site that i handed over i suggested creating an SQL that would have taken me 2 hours to write and he kind of shot down that idea but i thought it was good
