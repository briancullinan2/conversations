SkYsThELiMiT186: i hated it
BrianJCullinan: and i am sick of all these prude preps wearing skanky clothes and then getting all angry when someone starts looking at them
BrianJCullinan: its gay if they can't handle the sexual harrassment then why do they prevoke it
BrianJCullinan: thats why i think they should enforce dress code so when i am sitting in English class minding my own business when someone acuses me infront of the whole class of looking down someone pants because their ass is hanging out because all these prude prissy girls wear naughty clothes and can't handle guys looking at them
BrianJCullinan: it would have never happened if the moronic security gaurds would actually do their job instead of just walking around like tuff guys and like their soul purpose is to stand around maybe the should enforce some of the rules
BrianJCullinan: i'm so sick of it!

SkYsThELiMiT186: yes oh my gosh
SkYsThELiMiT186: he is so nice..and so funny, his sense of humor is so great, and we can talk about serious things and goofy things, its so fun!
SkYsThELiMiT186: but he lives in tempe :(
SkYsThELiMiT186: it SORT OF sounds like he's interested. he called me very pretty, and said that he was blown away when he first saw me. he's said that a couple times. but i dunno if its me, but its hard to believe
SkYsThELiMiT186: like he is just saying it
SkYsThELiMiT186: because he's that nice
SkYsThELiMiT186: plus he talks about this other girl a lot
SkYsThELiMiT186: who is SO pretty
BrianJCullinan: i c
BrianJCullinan: well i think you should go for it
BrianJCullinan: your like me, we get let down and sooner then later we find someone else to like
BrianJCullinan: remember at the begging of the year you liked scott?
SkYsThELiMiT186: i know but i dunno...
SkYsThELiMiT186: yeah
BrianJCullinan: how many guys has it been since then?  i'm not saying you have a problem i'm just saying you look in all the right places and find so many opportunities
SkYsThELiMiT186: im not sure what you mean
SkYsThELiMiT186: i havent found any opportunities
BrianJCullinan: so even if things don't work you will find someone else, you are such a lovable person, hell i would go out with you;  believe it or not but i'm not always as shallow as i act.  i really like girls that i can have a conversation with, and as you know i'm very good at talking, and i've been told i listen well to, so we are a like in some ways and its very attractive so don't give up on yourself, just be yourself and you will find friends where ever you go
SkYsThELiMiT186: see thats why i dont think he is being serious when he says im pretty
SkYsThELiMiT186: i mean no one has really told me that
BrianJCullinan: and if hes not then he is the one with problems
BrianJCullinan: and if your not (which you are) then guys must just like you for other reasons
SkYsThELiMiT186: i sort of gave him the impression that i liked sean
SkYsThELiMiT186: which i did...or do...i don't know...im so confused
BrianJCullinan: thats what i'm saying about you looking in the right places, you are always mentioning guys that like you, even if you never hook up with them, your still having fun right?
SkYsThELiMiT186: ive never mentioned guys that like me!
BrianJCullinan: well lets see
BrianJCullinan: well i swore there have been times but i can't remember
SkYsThELiMiT186: my best friend
SkYsThELiMiT186: that is prolly the only time
BrianJCullinan: what i'm saying is, go for it, let on that you like him, SLOWLY, so even if he doesn't like you back it will still be fun for a while longer
BrianJCullinan: then just tell him
SkYsThELiMiT186: yeahh
SkYsThELiMiT186: i dunno he is just like
BrianJCullinan: tell him you like him, its not to hard
SkYsThELiMiT186: you wouldnt think he would think im pretty, thats the thing
SkYsThELiMiT186: because hes this tall muscly cute guy
BrianJCullinan: maybe you will hook up, then you will be happy, and if you don't hook up you will find someone else
SkYsThELiMiT186: thats true
SkYsThELiMiT186: im starting not to let it get me down
SkYsThELiMiT186: like when a guy doesnt like me

BrianJCullinan: i think that you think you do
SkYsThELiMiT186: it sucks
SkYsThELiMiT186: i think thats why im cautioning myself with bobby
SkYsThELiMiT186: because i don't believe in myself, i think the worst
SkYsThELiMiT186: i want to believe in myself
BrianJCullinan: dude at least you have the balls to talk to a guy you like

I realized then it was a water faucet, but I didn't want to look like a jerk, so I said, &quot;Yeah, that's the one I want.&quot; It ended up costing me almost five hundred dollars to get that faucet removed. But you know, I've still got that faucet, and I wouldn't trade it for any dog in the world.

SkYsThELiMiT186: so i cant help you there

SkYsThELiMiT186: he is kind, sensitive, so funny, sweet, caring, SO smart, artistic, plays guitar, he is everything
SkYsThELiMiT186: i think that they were distractions
SkYsThELiMiT186: i didnt want to admit that i liked him let alone loved him
SkYsThELiMiT186: we say 'i love you' all the time
SkYsThELiMiT186: i just didnt know i meant it
BrianJCullinan: did you?
SkYsThELiMiT186: yes
BrianJCullinan: it sounds like a great relationship what happened?
SkYsThELiMiT186: well, great friendship
SkYsThELiMiT186: he is the only person i can tell everything to and i know he will not judge me
BrianJCullinan: :-( wut about me????
SkYsThELiMiT186: well of course you too
BrianJCullinan: what went wrong?
SkYsThELiMiT186: but you know what i mean
BrianJCullinan: yes i know but you still haven't told me why you are upset!?
SkYsThELiMiT186: well everything was good and then i sort of realized i liked him. this was like october, before homecoming, then i knew i liked him at homecoming. but i convinced myself i couldnt tell him...
BrianJCullinan: and did you eventually?
SkYsThELiMiT186: so a couple weeks after that he started hanging out with this girl danielle, and they were getting along great, and then they started going out. we didnt see much of eachother or didnt talk to eachother after that
BrianJCullinan: ouch
BrianJCullinan: i know how that feels
BrianJCullinan: is there anything worse then that?
SkYsThELiMiT186: so i was sad, i didnt have my other half around to tell my worries to, and i was just lost. so after about a month of not talking i eventually asked him what was wrong with us. and we got in a huge fight. and i told him it hurt so bad because i liked him. and he told me he used to like me too. at the exact same time.
SkYsThELiMiT186: so i was pretty crushed after that. and it was on my mind all the time. i couldn't handle it
BrianJCullinan: i don't know what to say
SkYsThELiMiT186: i will have to finish my story tomorrow though
SkYsThELiMiT186: i promise

BrianJCullinan: i can't find any pages
SkYsThELiMiT186: its ok
SkYsThELiMiT186: i'll find one in the middle
BrianJCullinan: While at the funeral of her own mother, a girl met this guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing, so  much her dream guy she believed him to be, that she fell in love with him there but never asked for his number and could not find him. A few days later the girl killed her own sister.
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: Question: What is her motive in killing her sister?
BrianJCullinan: well?
SkYsThELiMiT186: i dunno.
SkYsThELiMiT186: thats weird...
BrianJCullinan: answer: She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again.    If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test by a famous American psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in this test and answered it correctly. If you didn't answer correctly - good for you.

*** Auto-response from SkYsThELiMiT186: Here on this day 
Don't turn away 
Fed up with just saying I might 
Now out on a limb 
There's no giving in 
And I'm not gonna take it this time 
Well here upon this day 
I won't turn away 
I'm fed up with just saying I might 
Now out on a limb 
There's no giving in 
And we're not gonna take it this time 
Out there in the clear! 
Wrapped around by a blistering degree 
I'm on top of the world and serene 
Wide awake, wide awake, are we? 
Are we? 
Now what in the hell, what am I supposed to do? 
Just turn around and regret it  
Or press on and make it through? 
See life is a lesson, one big fucking session 
And it's right there in front of you 
Go! Go to the sky! 
Devote and try 
Don't you want to believe? 
Go! Go to the sky! 
Devote your life, no boundaries! 

BrianJCullinan: I'm on a limb, at the edge of a six foot hole, and i've had enough, maybe i'll jump

SkYsThELiMiT186: you are good
SkYsThELiMiT186: when you really practice you can do it
SkYsThELiMiT186: i've seen it happen with you
BrianJCullinan: Ow

BrianJCullinan: That girl is to young for me.
BrianJCullinan: *Sigh*

BrianJCullinan: I'm sad
BrianJCullinan: She's really pretty
SkYsThELiMiT186: yeah she is a cutie
BrianJCullinan: I wish i could talk to her some more.
BrianJCullinan: Get to know her a little, tell her strait forward that i think she is pretty and see what kind of reaction i get
BrianJCullinan: It would really help
SkYsThELiMiT186: you will get to when school starts
BrianJCullinan: I think everyone should express their true honest feelings, as long as they are positive
BrianJCullinan: I think there would be even more relationships if everyone told people how they felt
BrianJCullinan: Like you and that guy at the consession stand last year, you should have told him you think hes really hot and then asked him out on a date.
BrianJCullinan: Yeah you didn't know him, but he had a nice smile, i doubt he would rape you, and you really could have hit it off
SkYsThELiMiT186: im gross
SkYsThELiMiT186: he would have blown me off
BrianJCullinan: He smiled at you!
SkYsThELiMiT186: because he was working at a concession stand
BrianJCullinan: Your not gross, i'd go out with you...
SkYsThELiMiT186: lol
BrianJCullinan: Mrs. Earnest didn't yell at me at all!
BrianJCullinan: And except for you, know one yelled at me.
SkYsThELiMiT186: i yelled at you?
BrianJCullinan: You had to say my name because i was telling Daniel to shut up and pay attention
SkYsThELiMiT186: thats hard
SkYsThELiMiT186: because i cant hear you guys
SkYsThELiMiT186: i wish people would realize that
BrianJCullinan: What?
SkYsThELiMiT186: like
SkYsThELiMiT186: if im telling someone to stop talking
SkYsThELiMiT186: im only going by, we're at attention and you're not supposed to talk
SkYsThELiMiT186: i cant hear what people are saying
SkYsThELiMiT186: and sometimes people get mad
BrianJCullinan: I know...
BrianJCullinan: I just wish people would listen in the first place, then there wouldn't be a problem.
BrianJCullinan: I tried really hard to stay in line with the whole, pay attention and don't talk thing last week
BrianJCullinan: and I think I did really good.
SkYsThELiMiT186: you did you definitely did
BrianJCullinan: The Evil *cough* Earnest didn't say my name at all, but she also didn't yell at some people she should have.
BrianJCullinan: I suppose its starting off good, since Half the band isn't freshman anymore, But then again, half the band still has the attention span of one.

never forget, never forget you 
the crazy times you helped me through

SkYsThELiMiT186: i hear that
BrianJCullinan: want a girlfriend
BrianJCullinan: everytime i find a good relationship it always seems to get flushed down the toilet
BrianJCullinan: how about you?
SkYsThELiMiT186: why is it flushed down the toilet?
BrianJCullinan: i just have so much to ask her, so much to talk about but never enough time and oportunity
BrianJCullinan: i'm such a loser when it comes to this
BrianJCullinan: what if she doesn't like me
BrianJCullinan: i'll be even more broken up
SkYsThELiMiT186: talk to her at school
SkYsThELiMiT186: start a conversation with her
BrianJCullinan: she won't talk to me
BrianJCullinan: * sigh* oh well
SkYsThELiMiT186: have you TRIED?
BrianJCullinan: i am prepared for the worse, as usual
SkYsThELiMiT186: i hate when you do that

BrianJCullinan: are you having better luck then me?

SkYsThELiMiT186: yeah tell me about it
SkYsThELiMiT186: i guess its just meant to be like that
BrianJCullinan: it seems like its without any warning doesn't it?
SkYsThELiMiT186: exactly
BrianJCullinan: same with me
BrianJCullinan: but not as far
BrianJCullinan: like with her, we had a great talk all last weekend, i talked to her today and got nothing from her, and now i'm afraid she won't talk to me very much
BrianJCullinan: i really like her and all, but i wish she would talk me in person
BrianJCullinan: she said she'd be on a lot this week, and i leave my work schedule in my away message, but oh well
BrianJCullinan: tomorrow i'm going to tell her she can make it up to me by letting me take her to the movies next monday
SkYsThELiMiT186: :)
BrianJCullinan: *sigh* your not alone
BrianJCullinan: feels good to not be alone doesn't it?

BrianJCullinan: it was fun
BrianJCullinan: shes such a great girl
BrianJCullinan: i like her
SkYsThELiMiT186: so why the change?
BrianJCullinan: but i thought a lot about her, and decided the only person i should really listen to when i'm having problems, is myself
SkYsThELiMiT186: i dunno about that
SkYsThELiMiT186: you seem to change your mind a lot
BrianJCullinan: remember everytime you ask me for help, i always tell you not to put so much pressure on relationships
BrianJCullinan: well i say that and then i go and do it, its kind of hypocritical
SkYsThELiMiT186: you need to realize that she IS a girl, and girls can get confusing, so if she isn't talking for a day or two, it doesn't mean she doesn't like you anymore, it may mean she's having a bad day or just doesn't want to talk and that's okay
BrianJCullinan: exactly
BrianJCullinan: i realize that now
BrianJCullinan: and even though i really really want to go out with her, i can wait
BrianJCullinan: i should just be as best of friend to her as i can be
BrianJCullinan: and then it will last longer
SkYsThELiMiT186: yeah
SkYsThELiMiT186: thats a good idea
BrianJCullinan: shes so cute though

BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: can i say it now?
SkYsThELiMiT186: yeah please
BrianJCullinan: to put it simply, kids just don't get the same experience as they would while interacting with students and teachers.  Some students taking advantage of Internew may be attending a school as well, but all the same, it is a much better environment to work in at school, then infront of a computer at home
BrianJCullinan: hold on i might have to improvise

BrianJCullinan: what did i do?
SkYsThELiMiT186: she was late this morning because she was getting help on an essay
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: shes an f-ing squad leader, if she can't be there ontime then how can the rest of the section be expected to be on time?
SkYsThELiMiT186: did you not read what i wrote dude?
SkYsThELiMiT186: she wasnt late intentionally
BrianJCullinan: yeah and how about all those sectionals she misses because shes to busy talking?
SkYsThELiMiT186: when has this happened?
BrianJCullinan: every week since school started
BrianJCullinan: scott knows what i'm talking about
SkYsThELiMiT186: you guys need to TELL SOMEONE!

[03/31/2005 01:48 PM] *** Auto-response from Bridget: the first job i had when i was 17 was burger king. i didn't want to call it burger king either so i called it the BK Lounge. If the girls were like, "where do you work?" i would be like "i'm a bouncer down at the BK Lounge."  
"Can we get in?" 
"Not without coups, baby."
