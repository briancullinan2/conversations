[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmm might not fit though
[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't even know
[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have to e-mail your service provider
[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: and ask them what your database name is
[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: if they even support databasing
[30/11/2004 04:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: they probably do
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: but you have to e-mail and ask
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] Greg: ?
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: or look in the forums on the master site
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] Greg: they dont have
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: hm?
[30/11/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have to ask
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then go to phpBB.com
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: and download version 2.0
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] Greg: wait
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: and follow the manual
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] Greg: i  need all of that to get
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] Greg: forums?
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: basically says upload, fill out form, change some access settings, you're done
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[30/11/2004 04:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: forums are hard
[30/11/2004 04:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: then you need a genius like me to edit the entire skin so that it looks the way you want it
[30/11/2004 04:26 PM] Greg: lol
[30/11/2004 04:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: because the skin it comes with, and the other downloadable once suck ass
[30/11/2004 04:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: and never match the theme you already use
[30/11/2004 04:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: unless you made your own like i did, then they definitely won't match
[30/11/2004 04:28 PM] Greg: well let me
[30/11/2004 04:28 PM] Greg: try
[30/11/2004 04:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: rosters, and matches will be hard too
[30/11/2004 04:28 PM] Greg: ?
[30/11/2004 04:28 PM] Greg: y?
[30/11/2004 04:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: you either have to copy and past the output from your server and use php to translate it, or make something do it automatically
[30/11/2004 04:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: have to figured out how to run your own call of duty server
[30/11/2004 04:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: ?

[05/12/2004 12:48 AM] Greg: so how do u put media files on the website
[05/12/2004 12:48 AM] Greg: do u have to put the file into imaghes?
[05/12/2004 12:48 AM] Greg: images?
[05/12/2004 12:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: you want to play music in the backgroud?
[05/12/2004 12:49 AM] Greg: whats the coding for it?
[05/12/2004 12:49 AM] Greg: yes
[05/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: what type of file is it?
[05/12/2004 12:49 AM] Greg: mp3
[05/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: then you can either import windows media player, or convert it to wav and use the built in coding for it
[05/12/2004 12:50 AM] Greg: how do u import winbdows media player
[05/12/2004 12:50 AM] BrianJCullinan: probaby a better idea to convert it to wav but that always has longer loading time
[05/12/2004 12:50 AM] BrianJCullinan: importing WMP is easy
[05/12/2004 12:50 AM] Greg: ...

[13/12/2004 10:37 PM] Greg: till....
[13/12/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: just remember when you decide on a temp that you like/will eventually modify, delete the other ones unless you want your users to be able to decide how your site should look
[13/12/2004 10:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they can choose which template they want to use unless you uninstall it, to me that doesn't make any sense
[13/12/2004 10:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: but w/e
[13/12/2004 10:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: modify the temps don't just choose one
[13/12/2004 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can't seem to edit the shockwave
[13/12/2004 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if you could somehow get the file in an un-compiled .fla file then i could edit for sure
[13/12/2004 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: g2g to bed now
