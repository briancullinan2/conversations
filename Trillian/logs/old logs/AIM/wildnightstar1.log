BrianJCullinan: terrible
BrianJCullinan: need a girlfriend
wildnightstar1: well I'm single again....so join the group on searching for people. Think I may have one though 
BrianJCullinan: cuz if i don't have one i'm going to get used to not having one and then i'll never be able to get another one and it will be a giant cycle of depression that i can't afford to let continue any longer
BrianJCullinan: huh?  single again?
BrianJCullinan: what happened?
wildnightstar1: dumped my guy today
BrianJCullinan: yyyyyyy?
BrianJCullinan: thats kind of cruel
wildnightstar1: felt like I was dating my brother, or a really good friend. felt really uncomfortable, and strange. better than stringing him along
BrianJCullinan: yeah i guess

BrianJCullinan: thats good, at the expense of you life being in danger, i can't imagine what it would be like to lose you, i hardly had the chance to really get to know you and it would just be to sad to bare
wildnightstar1: I know that way to well
wildnightstar1: to many deaths this year compared to births in my opinion
