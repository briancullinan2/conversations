[27/09/2004 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm being a script kitty again
[27/09/2004 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: but now with game AI
[27/09/2004 10:26 PM] Alex: lol
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am thinking of a concept somewhat uncommon but not impossible, AI generated AI scripts
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: meaning the AI in the program changes and generates its own AI
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] Alex: what would that tdo? D:
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] Alex: @_@;;
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: not only using probability algorithms, but statistical algorithms aswell
[27/09/2004 10:31 PM] Alex: man that shit wouldm ake my brain explode D:
[27/09/2004 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: so if the computer does something that never makes it win it will change it so that it tries it a different way
[27/09/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: eg, FPS - computer walks into a line of fire and dies, changes script to not walk into constant line of fire
[27/09/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: basically so that we don't have to make the AI, we just have to program it to copy the user and keep combining it with what was already there
[27/09/2004 10:33 PM] Alex: =o
