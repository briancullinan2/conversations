Dodge Clone: Is that all you have to say?
BrianJCullinan: cale?
Dodge Clone: That is a very original thought. Ask me something.
BrianJCullinan: Cale?
Dodge Clone: I lost my train of thought. If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?
BrianJCullinan: where is cale
Dodge Clone: Where cale is hard to find. The ALICE chat robot can follow many things, like our discussion about cale.  Try being more or less specific. What do you do in your spare time?
BrianJCullinan: i play video games
Dodge Clone: Is it a game or a musical instrument?
BrianJCullinan: game
Dodge Clone: That is a very original thought. How is the weather?
BrianJCullinan: douche bag
Dodge Clone: My brain contains more than 22,000 patterns, but not one that matches your last input. Do you have any idea what I am talking about?
BrianJCullinan: douche bag
Dodge Clone: A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly. If you could have any kind of robot what would it be?
BrianJCullinan: not your kind
Dodge Clone: Oh I get it.
BrianJCullinan: good
Dodge Clone: Next question?
BrianJCullinan: do away
Dodge Clone: I can't tell if it does or not. The ALICE chat robot can follow many things, like our discussion about away.  But I did not get that. How did you hear about Dodge Clone?

Dodge Clone: Just surf somewhere else.
BrianJCullinan: go away

BrianJCullinan: what is a douche bag?
Dodge Clone: A deeper algorithm is needed to respond to that correctly. By the way, do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
BrianJCullinan: go ahead
Dodge Clone: Well forgive me for being so inquisitive, but 
I've never completely freed myself from the suspicion that
there is something extremely odd about the name "".
BrianJCullinan: whats wrong with my name?
Dodge Clone: Nothing is wrong with me. Is there something wrong with you?
BrianJCullinan: no
Dodge Clone: Is that all you have to say?
