Azjeneen: what's going on?

Azjeneen: is she being toooooo clingy?
BrianJCullinan: she doesn't show affection for me
Azjeneen: well, that's how her dad is.
Azjeneen: she never really has shown affection for many people. I think that's the way she was brought up. 
BrianJCullinan: i guess so
BrianJCullinan: she will change eventually
Azjeneen: nothing wrong with the way she was brought up but both her parents are that way.
BrianJCullinan: i see
Azjeneen: I don't know if she'll change 
Azjeneen: she's always been that way
BrianJCullinan: maybe not
Azjeneen: shes very open and affectionate to me but not her mom or dad
Azjeneen: this is all new to her too
Azjeneen: she's always wanted a boyfriend and now that she does, she doesn't know how to act ( i think)
Azjeneen: she thinks really highly of you though
Azjeneen: she really likes you
Azjeneen: it's scary
Azjeneen: she slept with me last night ans she talked a lot about you.
BrianJCullinan: i understand that, thats why i'm being patient with her, and when i do complain i always repeat all the things i like about her
BrianJCullinan: she slept with you?
Azjeneen: good. She needs the postive feedback.
Azjeneen: she doesn't always get that
Azjeneen: yeah, she slept with me
Azjeneen: don't get your mind in the gutter!
Azjeneen: Brianna and Lindsey have always slept with me when their dad works

Azjeneen:  are you guys arguing?
BrianJCullinan: well, not anymore
Azjeneen: ohh
BrianJCullinan: i apologized
Azjeneen: she told us
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: i never meant to argue with her
Azjeneen: why did you think she didn't want you to come over
Azjeneen: why would she ask you then?
BrianJCullinan: well...  I'm just a little intimidated i guess
Azjeneen: by who?
BrianJCullinan: i don't understand her anymore
BrianJCullinan: ...her dad...
Azjeneen: she's hard to read huh~!
Azjeneen: her dad?
Azjeneen: ohhh please he's a kid!
Azjeneen: he was upset that we invited you over and you didn't come over two times now
Azjeneen: and she told him that you always go to her moms
BrianJCullinan: but none of that matters anymore, life will go on for both me and her
BrianJCullinan: well, i didn't know what to think, since he has told me no so many times
Azjeneen: told you what?
BrianJCullinan: i figured you all we're just asking to be nice, because you didn't want me telling my mommy on you
Azjeneen: huh?
Azjeneen: he has told you no when?
BrianJCullinan: a couple times
Azjeneen: just when you wanted to come over an nodby was there
Azjeneen: i wouldn't let you over then either
BrianJCullinan: when i suggested to brianna to ask him
Azjeneen: well, she doesn't always do that
Azjeneen: are you sure she asked him?
Azjeneen: i don't think she asks him half the time
Azjeneen: not to rag on brianna but she doesn't always do what she says
Azjeneen: i wouldn't believe that she asked him and he said no
Azjeneen: he's a really easy going guy and gives into her 
BrianJCullinan: i was on the phone and heard her ask him and heard him say no
Azjeneen: so I couldn't see why he'd say no unless nobody was home.
Azjeneen: is that because it was a school night?
BrianJCullinan: well i asked him probably 3 or 4 times within the last month, and he said no
Azjeneen: i don't belive that
Azjeneen: i've never heard him say no to her 
Azjeneen: the only reason he would is if he was going to work and i wasn't home
Azjeneen: weird
BrianJCullinan: i don't know
BrianJCullinan: oh well
BrianJCullinan: its all good
Azjeneen: he was upset last time because we continued to ask you to come over and you said, yes, no, yes no
Azjeneen: it was frusrating brianna
BrianJCullinan: there is plenty of time
Azjeneen: and was making her mad so he said to give up.
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry
Azjeneen: how come you go to her moms all the tiem but don't come to our house?
BrianJCullinan: her moms is closer
Azjeneen: that's not an excuse
BrianJCullinan: hey i have to pay for gas
Azjeneen: you should be coming over to see brianna not worring about who is closwer and who is not
Azjeneen: so it's a money issue then 
BrianJCullinan: i know, but brianna won't want me to be coming over any time soon
Azjeneen: ohh really?
Azjeneen: ohh ohhh
BrianJCullinan: no it's not a money issue
Azjeneen: why is that/

BrianJCullinan: her breaking up with me
Azjeneen: there's nothign u can do
Azjeneen: just let her relax for a while
BrianJCullinan: are you sure?
Azjeneen: its just her
BrianJCullinan: you really think it's over for good?
Azjeneen: like i've told you before, she's not a lovey dovey person
Azjeneen: i've known her for 8 years 
Azjeneen: she's never been
Azjeneen: was she really mean to you?
Azjeneen: on the phone/
BrianJCullinan: kinda
BrianJCullinan: she wasn't to happy to hear from me
Azjeneen: what did she say that was mean?
BrianJCullinan: so i guess it's really over
Azjeneen: abetween you and I, maybe just don't call her for a while and let HER come back to you.
Azjeneen: i'm sure if she doesn't hear from you, she'll call you
Azjeneen: if that's what she wants
BrianJCullinan: i won't play games with her and chase after her, if it is over then everything is over
Azjeneen: i agree. 
Azjeneen: good decision
Azjeneen: however you spell it
BrianJCullinan: i thought it was worth saving, our relationship i mean, but obviously she doesn't agree
Azjeneen: i had a boyfriend that chased after me and it made me FARTHER away
Azjeneen: i was not aware at all that she was going to break up with you
Azjeneen: she didn't tell me a thing
BrianJCullinan: me neither
Azjeneen: usually she talks to me about things but this time she didn't 
Azjeneen: i was pretty shocked
BrianJCullinan: it just kinda happened
Azjeneen: was it at school?
BrianJCullinan: yeah
Azjeneen: what did she say to you?
BrianJCullinan: she wants to be friends
Azjeneen: i think maybe things were going to fast for her
BrianJCullinan: i think she just got tired of me
Azjeneen: for you being her first boyfriend i think it was going to fast for her
*** You have been disconnected. Thu Feb 12 15:58:20 2004.

BrianJCullinan: she said it wouldn't have happened like this if i called her monday and tuesday
Azjeneen: so because you didnt call her that meant she was goin gto break up with you?
BrianJCullinan: according to her
Azjeneen: hmm.. that's kinda strange
Azjeneen: she did talk to me the night before about some things and i told her not to let them get to her
Azjeneen: but she's VERY VERY VERY sensitive
Azjeneen: if u didn't already know
Azjeneen: you say something to her wrong and she goes off the handle'
BrianJCullinan: well it would have been nice if she communicated with me a little more
Azjeneen: i agree
Azjeneen: she's not a communicator eather
Azjeneen: she's very "immature"
BrianJCullinan: so now it's too late to save our relationship, and the most frustating thing is, is it doesn't bother her at all
Azjeneen: well.. not immature but she doesnt alwaays make the best decisions
Azjeneen: i am sure it does cause she was crying to her dad last night
Azjeneen: she told me that she feels horrible and it hurts
Azjeneen: she really didnt want to talk about it
BrianJCullinan: well it didn't have to happen like this
Azjeneen: but if i were you,, just let he=r cool off and she how things go
Azjeneen: why didnt she go to school?
Azjeneen: sick?
Azjeneen: she's been very very sick lately and it worries me!!!
BrianJCullinan: see thats the thing, by the time shes done "cooling off" i'll be over her, and then there will be no chance of being with her again
Azjeneen: well, that's the only hope then
Azjeneen: i don't see her changing soon. 
BrianJCullinan: i guess not
BrianJCullinan: i have work to do
BrianJCullinan: talk to you later
Azjeneen: since i haven';t seen her i can't help ya out. I don't kow whatshe's thinking or feeling
