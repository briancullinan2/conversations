[29/07/2004 07:26 PM] skankinwhiteman: eh, if you want to
[29/07/2004 07:27 PM] skankinwhiteman: I mean, you should clean them out so the sound isn't being effected
[29/07/2004 07:27 PM] skankinwhiteman: but it's up to you if you want your horn to be really shinny
[29/07/2004 07:27 PM] skankinwhiteman: I'm going to use my cornet durring the season because it's easier to carry
[29/07/2004 07:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: cool
[29/07/2004 07:31 PM] skankinwhiteman: mmhrm
[29/07/2004 07:31 PM] skankinwhiteman: and if you have a smaller brass instrument that's in Bb feel free to use it durring the season
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: a pocket trumpet?
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] skankinwhiteman: is it in Bb?
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it will look different from everyone else's
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] skankinwhiteman: it's fine by me, but you should ask Mrs. E
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] skankinwhiteman: lol
[29/07/2004 07:32 PM] skankinwhiteman: my cornet looks different too
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but at least it is around the same length
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: and the audience won't notice
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: but a pocket trumpet would be pretty obvious
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] skankinwhiteman: lol
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] skankinwhiteman: yeah
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] skankinwhiteman: but as long as it's in Bb I don't care
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] skankinwhiteman: but if you want to use it I'd ask Earnest
[29/07/2004 07:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[29/07/2004 07:34 PM] skankinwhiteman: that's what I did with my cornet lol
[29/07/2004 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[29/07/2004 07:35 PM] skankinwhiteman: so if E says you can go for it dude
[29/07/2004 07:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[29/07/2004 07:35 PM] skankinwhiteman: daniel is funny sometimes
[29/07/2004 07:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[29/07/2004 07:36 PM] skankinwhiteman: like when he says stupid shit just to be in a convorsation when what he says doesn't have to do with each other like at lunch today
[29/07/2004 07:36 PM] skankinwhiteman: I was talking to claire and andrea and daniel comes in and he says "you know I used to think that the instrument made the player but then I found out that I just love buying instruments"
[29/07/2004 07:36 PM] skankinwhiteman: thinking that the instrument makes the play is completly different from buying instruments
[29/07/2004 07:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah

 And I would not lie to you, cause Sunday morning soon will come when  
 Things will be much easier to say, upon the microphone like a Boss DJ  
 But I’m wont walk upon the sea like it was dry land  
 The Boss DJ ain’t nothing but a man  
 No trouble, No fuss- I know why  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 Rumors are spreadin’ all over my town but it’s like stones and sticks  
 cuz on the microphone is where I get my fix  
 just let the lovin’ take ahold cuz it will if you let it  
 I’m funky not a junkie but I know where to get it  
 No trouble, no fuss- I know why  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 Oowee girl oowee girl oowee girl  
 There really ain’t no time to waste, really ain’t no time to hate  
 Ain’t got no time to waste, time to hate  
 Really ain’t no time to let the time go waste  
 So mister DJ don’t stop the music, I wanna know  
 Are you feelin the same way too?  
 I wanna rock it with you girl ooh girl  
 Don’t stop cuz  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 It’s so nice, I wanna hear the same song twice  
 Nowadays the songs on the radio all drive me crazy

[01/09/2004 09:49 PM] Derek: well what do you want to do to the spirit stick?
[01/09/2004 09:50 PM] Derek: andy and I are splitting up sectionals into two groups, I take four, he takes four but there will be times when we are all together at which time I am in control of everything and everyone
[01/09/2004 09:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok?
[01/09/2004 09:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: are you trying to imply something?

[01/09/2004 10:01 PM] Derek: and your like right next to him right?
[01/09/2004 10:01 PM] Derek: because I seriously can only hear me, andy, a sax, and the drums when we're out there and ocationally a freshman that's behind me and decides to play
[01/09/2004 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe if he wasn't such a bitch and actually admits he makes mistakes too, then i would be a little nicer about critisizing him, i'm part of the band to, and i don't deserve to look bad or sound bad because he does
[01/09/2004 10:03 PM] Derek: wait...
[01/09/2004 10:03 PM] Derek: he thinks he plays everything right?

[01/09/2004 10:04 PM] Derek: and I've heard him play before
[01/09/2004 10:04 PM] Derek: he never plays his solo right in lion sleeps
[01/09/2004 10:05 PM] Derek: because it's eighth eighth not eighth quarter like when everyone plays it
[01/09/2004 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok, i can be more posative i know, but he does act like he is the best

[16/09/2004 03:19 PM] Derek: we don't have a game on friday
[16/09/2004 03:19 PM] Derek: interesting
[16/09/2004 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: i was thinking that when the freshmen went home they could get the stuff they need, their parents drop them off at 3:00 and then we drive them back to school around 4:15 for a 4:30 call time
[16/09/2004 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's the way i had planned it
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: ok
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: well
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: so instead of their parents driving them back at 4:30 they just bring them earlier
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: we'll discuss this more later because we don't have a game next week on friday haha
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: BUT
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: we could do it thurs
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] Derek: OH OH
[16/09/2004 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably a good idea if their parents get to see them, that's why i didn't suggest going strait from school to DR
[16/09/2004 03:21 PM] Derek: ok
[16/09/2004 03:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: why don't we just make the first one on the first

[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: oh
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: it's an oldschool gaming term
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: it's like
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: being the master over everyone
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: sort of
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i know
[20/09/2004 02:36 PM] Derek: people use l337 now
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: this map is for D3 right?
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: or UrT?
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: i figured you'd get fan mail for being the clan master or something
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: its for quake 3, but i might be able to convert to doom 3
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: ah i see
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: I get fan mail because I'm the artist of a web comic
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: and people send me stuff
[20/09/2004 02:37 PM] Derek: all the time
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] Derek: I get IMs for gaming
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: cool
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] Derek: it gets agravating early in the morning
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] Derek: because they'll all east coast people
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah that's a problem
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: u need a guy over there answering e-mails too
[20/09/2004 02:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: expand
[20/09/2004 02:39 PM] Derek: if they allow mics, you should play with european people
[20/09/2004 02:39 PM] Derek: it's so fun
[20/09/2004 02:39 PM] Derek: haha
[20/09/2004 02:39 PM] Derek: I'll keep that in mind
[20/09/2004 02:39 PM] Derek: so do you spawn and all the fighting takes place on the galley?
[20/09/2004 02:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: you spawn on bow and stern top level
[20/09/2004 02:40 PM] Derek: can you leave the ship?
[20/09/2004 02:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: actually i haven't decided i might make one flag on top and on on the second level
[20/09/2004 02:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah you can go anywhere in the water but later i might block some area of that off
[20/09/2004 02:41 PM] Derek: kk
[20/09/2004 02:41 PM] Derek: you should make a boarding boat (the little boat that when not in water is on the side) off in the water i you allow people to go in it
[20/09/2004 02:41 PM] Derek: and I'm interested to see what the inside of the ship or the second level look like
[20/09/2004 02:41 PM] Derek: but the flag on the top and bottom would be a cool idea
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah that boat idea is good
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] Derek: like if you could make the flag on top be in the crow's next or the very top sail
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] Derek: you could make two versions of it
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] Derek: death match and capture the flag
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] Derek: but it looks really cool
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i haven't added barrels and crates inside yet
[20/09/2004 02:42 PM] Derek: ooh
[20/09/2004 02:43 PM] Derek: I see
[20/09/2004 02:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah you can play either with the same spawnpoints\
[20/09/2004 02:43 PM] Derek: nifty
[20/09/2004 02:43 PM] Derek: yeah
[20/09/2004 02:43 PM] Derek: but the map looks good
[20/09/2004 02:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: thanks
[20/09/2004 02:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: it's been a lot of fun making it
[20/09/2004 02:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: like a giant playground
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] Derek: haha
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] Derek: I bet
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] Derek: add a bunch of random stuff to screw with people haahaha
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] Derek: j/k
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: you could do anything and people would play it
[20/09/2004 02:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: people were making fun of me though
[20/09/2004 02:47 PM] Derek: what for?
[20/09/2004 02:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: i said i was making a map and their like yeah like what ut_box or ut_first room
[20/09/2004 02:47 PM] Derek: oh

[20/09/2004 02:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: as if i could make a map
[20/09/2004 02:48 PM] Derek: yeah

[20/09/2004 02:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i figured i would make a map just to say i know how and then more onto something else like hardware hacking and writing my own drivers to use my wireless on linux
[20/09/2004 02:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: brb
[20/09/2004 02:51 PM] Derek: hahahahahaha

[17/12/2004 11:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: we both know that she has avoided giving me first part, even if it means making both parts more equal
[17/12/2004 11:53 AM] Derek: yeah

[03/03/2005 09:42 PM] *** Auto-response from Derek: Unfortunatly I went to my mom's cyropractor today (3-3-05) and he tells me to stop eating dairy because my body is having trouble digesting it which is causing me to have acne, what a coincidence, my favorite food cheese, I can never have again. I think the fact that Cherissa said yes had to be balanced by a shit load of bad things like this jackass passing me in a quadrouple solid line and kicking up a bunch of rocks and chipping my windshield to hell and no cheese ever again, Mr. T taking half an hour to write me a letter so I couldn't give greg a lesson today which made me feel like a giant fucking asshole - sorry Kohn's :-( and I'm not blaming Mr. T for that I'm really glad he wrote the letter for me.

[06/21/2005 12:19 PM] Derek: so you have to pay 39.99 for the game then an extra $50 for online play?
[06/21/2005 12:19 PM] Derek: is that a one time fee or is that like a yearly fee?
[06/21/2005 12:19 PM] Me: no if you pay for the game that's it

[06/21/2005 12:32 PM] Me: i just got about 20 gigs from friends last night

[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Derek: nifty
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Me: my elementalist is lvl 16
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Derek: are you in a guild?
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Derek: cool
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Me: and i am pretty far in the game
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Me: yes
[06/21/2005 12:33 PM] Me: we are working on getting a guild hall
[06/21/2005 12:34 PM] Derek: did you start it yourself?
[06/21/2005 12:34 PM] Me: i have started one but didn't like the name so i joined my friends and he made me an officer
[06/21/2005 12:34 PM] Me: officers can add people to the guild
[06/21/2005 12:34 PM] Derek: cool
[06/21/2005 12:34 PM] Me: yeah
[06/21/2005 12:35 PM] Derek: so is it worth the money?
[06/21/2005 12:36 PM] Derek: and if you're not completely annoyed by my questions how difficult/time consuming is it to make money and level up?
[06/21/2005 12:36 PM] Me: uh making money isn't to hard
[06/21/2005 12:36 PM] Me: leveling up, you have to do quests because fighting monsters gets old and doesn't level you up fast enough
[06/21/2005 12:36 PM] Me: 20lvl is the highest
[06/21/2005 12:37 PM] Me: which kind of sucks
[06/21/2005 12:37 PM] Me: maybe in later editions they will expand on that
[06/21/2005 12:37 PM] Derek: is it 20 combined or 20 each?
[06/21/2005 12:37 PM] Derek: for each profession
[06/21/2005 12:37 PM] Me: combined
[06/21/2005 12:38 PM] Me: you level up the same for your secondary profession then you choose which abilities you want
[06/21/2005 12:38 PM] Me: but you can change it too
[06/21/2005 12:38 PM] Me: then you also choose your skills
[06/21/2005 12:38 PM] Me: and you can change them in town
[06/21/2005 12:38 PM] Derek: what do you mean by you can change it?
[06/21/2005 12:39 PM] Derek: like you can deselect and select new ones if you don't like them?
[06/21/2005 12:39 PM] Me: like your abilities are how much magic power you have or fighting power you have
[06/21/2005 12:39 PM] Me: you can change those up and down
[06/21/2005 12:39 PM] Me: as you level up you get more points to use on your abilities
[06/21/2005 12:40 PM] Me: then in town you can switch out skills, like extra attacks or for me healing prayers you can change which ones you want to use in battle
[06/21/2005 12:40 PM] Derek: ah ic
[06/21/2005 12:41 PM] Derek: have you been in any guild duels yet?
[06/21/2005 12:41 PM] Me: no not yet
[06/21/2005 12:42 PM] Derek: that sucks
[06/21/2005 12:42 PM] Derek: is it worth buying the game over all others?
[06/21/2005 12:43 PM] Me: i would say yes
[06/21/2005 12:43 PM] Me: it is a great way to spend your summer
[06/21/2005 12:43 PM] Derek: cool

[06/23/2005 01:25 PM] Derek: how long have you been playing it?
[06/23/2005 01:25 PM] Me: about a month
[06/23/2005 01:25 PM] Me: i haven't played the last couple of days though
[06/23/2005 01:25 PM] Derek: and the worrior and mesmer professions are the worst you say?
[06/23/2005 01:25 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 01:26 PM] Me: because warriors always have to run up to the enemy to attack them so all of the enemies attack the warrior
[06/23/2005 01:26 PM] Me: you can't kill from a safe distance
[06/23/2005 01:27 PM] Derek: that's why the warrior is the tank
[06/23/2005 01:27 PM] Derek: and the monk is supposed to heal him
[06/23/2005 01:28 PM] Derek: or is this RPG backwards from all others where you don't need a main tank or a healer, you just need casters to nuke from a distance and that kills everything
[06/23/2005 01:29 PM] Derek: are the necro and elementalist weak in the area of HP and defence?
[06/23/2005 01:30 PM] Me: no
[06/23/2005 01:30 PM] Me: not really
[06/23/2005 01:30 PM] Me: its all what you make it

[06/23/2005 01:33 PM] Me: because they are like pansy magic skills
