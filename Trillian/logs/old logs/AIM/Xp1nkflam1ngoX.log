Xp1nkflam1ngoX: hey!
BrianJCullinan: Oh?  You're talking to me again?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: ...yeah.. why wouldnt i b?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: that was jess before yelling at you, not me
BrianJCullinan: This brings upon a little problem
BrianJCullinan: I feel it is appropriate to tell a short story.
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: okay tell it 
BrianJCullinan: I knew a girl once before that let her friends talk on HER screen name, this was a problem because i never knew who i could trust.  Which naturally led to the demise of our relationship.  Since i am such a nice person and because I still have feelings for you, i am willing to let this pass, but i want you to know, it would be completely unacceptable to allow this non-sence to happen again.
BrianJCullinan: Understand?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: yes, and no
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: i am not allowed to let anyone tak on my screen name?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: other then me?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: why?
BrianJCullinan: Now, now, your taking this the wrong way, you should not let anyone other then YOU to talk to ME on YOUR sn.
BrianJCullinan: now do you understand?
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: yes i do!
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: thanx for clarifying
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: lol
BrianJCullinan: See because i am not there i can not fully enforce what i have demanded you do, and since there are girls here (alternatives) i would like to set down a few guidlines so you do not end up hurting me or yourself.
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: hahaha okay!
BrianJCullinan: I just don't want to be forced to chose an alternative, so really this benifits both you and me and the relationship we have.
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: okay, sounds like a good plan 
Xp1nkflam1ngoX: ;-)
