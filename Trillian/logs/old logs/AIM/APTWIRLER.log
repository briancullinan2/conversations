[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] Astin: procrastinator 
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's what i do all day, is work through the homework
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: no i actually just have a schedual
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's when i plan to do it, before class
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] Astin: lol 
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] Astin:  nice schedule 
[07/11/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: all monday i work on that homework, and sometimes all sunday too but i had a lot of other homework to do today
[07/11/2004 09:24 PM] Astin: o 
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not going to worry about changing my schedule to come to some stupid sectional when he never asked when it was convenient for our section
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: hes to fucking worried about making it an "all brass" sectional
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: why he even wants to do that i don't know
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] Astin: ya 
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] Astin: hes not even going 
[07/11/2004 09:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: what is the difference between playing with low brass or having a sectional with the flutes or something
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: there is no difference, he just wants to make us do something 
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] Astin: there is no difference 
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: sometimes he does these things without thinking them through
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: andy does it to, how much time did we waste doing pushups?
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] Astin: too much 
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: that was completely unnessicary
[07/11/2004 09:27 PM] Astin: god that was so pointless 
[07/11/2004 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: and he just kept giving them out as if they even mattered
[07/11/2004 09:28 PM] Astin:  but then again they were just killing time they didnt know wat else to do 
[07/11/2004 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: exactly, they just wanted us to do something
[07/11/2004 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: no they just wanted to be abnocious and show off how much power they had
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] Astin: ya 
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: because both of them are power hungry, and then when they get it, and have opportunity to use their power over us, they waste it
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] Astin: ya they do 
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] Astin: why is derek section leader when andy does everything? 
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's why if mrs. earnest wasn't suck a fucking moron, she wouldn't have given all the power to two juniors
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: exactly
[07/11/2004 09:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they are power hungry and they waste it
[07/11/2004 09:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: andy is more power hungry then derek because derek is more passive
[07/11/2004 09:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: andy is actually a good guy when he is not around derek or his other friends
[07/11/2004 09:30 PM] Astin: ya 
[07/11/2004 09:30 PM] Astin: i think he is pretty nice all the time 
[07/11/2004 09:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: but when they are together, andy is a dick and derek let him do what ever he wants
[07/11/2004 09:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: you would think that, you've only been in band with him this year
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] Astin: i just cant stand derek 
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] Astin: he is nice sumtimes 
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: i've been here with him for more then 3, i've seen him around other people, hes not the kind of person that should be section leader
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: neither is derek
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] Astin:  but then sumtimes he just mean 
[07/11/2004 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah he is
