Luv2dance1687: only that time you called me shallow
BrianJCullinan: we used to, and i take that back, your not shallow
Luv2dance1687: I know

BrianJCullinan: shes always putting on makeup and shes always talking
Luv2dance1687: she hasnt been at school since thurs. and no one is answering their phone

BrianJCullinan: you still in love with tylor?

BrianJCullinan: i know your beautiful, and you talk to me and your nice to me, and your a dancer right?  well thats very attractive to

Luv2dance1687: you seem to be the only guy that feels that way
Luv2dance1687: lol
BrianJCullinan: there isn't anything wrong with your friend that you asked me about other then shes a little to cheeky and those personality problems i told you but thats it
Luv2dance1687: haha yeah
BrianJCullinan: yeah imagine that, a guy who tells you that everytime you talk to him is the one you'll never go out with, funny how life works sometimes
Luv2dance1687: yeah it is 
BrianJCullinan: i'm to short for you anyways
BrianJCullinan: its my turn, other then my height what is wrong with me?
Luv2dance1687: no one is too short for anybody 
Luv2dance1687: you dont know how to offend somebody
BrianJCullinan: huh?
BrianJCullinan: do i offend you?
Luv2dance1687: you have a problem being mean you are never mean to me
Luv2dance1687: I can be the biggest bitch of all and you will still be nice
BrianJCullinan: lol, sorry i guess
Luv2dance1687: I guess its not a bad thing
BrianJCullinan: i'm not mean to you because i like you i guess, if you were mean to me i would be upset but i guess with girls i like, i've learned to just walk away from it
BrianJCullinan: but ask brittany she would tell you i'm an ass to her
Luv2dance1687: good someones gotta be
Luv2dance1687: shes an ass to everyone else
BrianJCullinan: i'm always insulting her but i try not to push her over then limit
Luv2dance1687: what do you say to her
BrianJCullinan: *grin* you should have seen me tell her off before a game one time when she was bugging me, she was seriously gonna cry if i had kept going i almost felt bad and then i remembered how mean she was to me
Luv2dance1687: you should never make a girl cry
BrianJCullinan: it was terrible, she was gonna cry, and thats really bad
Luv2dance1687: yeah brittany has to be pretty damn upset to cry
Luv2dance1687: what did you say
BrianJCullinan: i know i felt bad, and i should appologize tomorrow now that you say that
Luv2dance1687: how long ago was it
BrianJCullinan: i can't remeber but i told her how terrible she was and how shes always insulting me and other people and i probably said shes never going to have a boyfriend if she keeps acting the way she does and i probably put some bad words in there to
BrianJCullinan: it was durring marching season i can't remember, it was at an away game
Luv2dance1687: you said she will prolly never have a bf
BrianJCullinan: she said she was going to change to percussion and leave the trumpets and she hated band
BrianJCullinan: yeah i know it was bad, brb
Luv2dance1687: you got mad cuz she said she hated band thats dumb why do you think I'm not in the band.
BrianJCullinan: she is always calling me bad names whenever i do something wrong and i was sick of it
BrianJCullinan: no that wasn't why i got mad at her, thats just what she said after i yelled at her when she was really upset
Luv2dance1687: Theres absolutely nothing wrong w/ band but its just not for some people so maybe its not for brittany
Luv2dance1687: oh
Luv2dance1687: well

BrianJCullinan: say something
Luv2dance1687: sorry
*** Auto-response sent to Luv2dance1687: To late I already left.  You should have talked to me when I was here.  now you missed your chance and I may never return. 
This is me reminding you to make the most of all the days given to you.  And always tell the people that mean most to you how much you care for them.  Because if one day someone you loved didn't return...
Luv2dance1687: you already had that one
Luv2dance1687: think of something new
BrianJCullinan: i don't have any better ones
Luv2dance1687: and less morbid
BrianJCullinan: yet
Luv2dance1687: well get thinking
BrianJCullinan: ok let me think of something from my story
Luv2dance1687: what story
BrianJCullinan: hows this?
Luv2dance1687: what
BrianJCullinan: She lay down against my body on the ground with her head to my heart.  I saw her dress rest against my dying body as I left; she was so beautiful
BrianJCullinan: no its kinda weird
Luv2dance1687: did you write it yet
BrianJCullinan: let me try something different
Luv2dance1687: yeah
Luv2dance1687: thats also pretty morbid
BrianJCullinan: ooo this is nice and depressing
BrianJCullinan: Thoughts of my life being up-happy overpowered my thoughts of love and peace.  I took his gun and held it up to my head; he jumped backwards and trying to convince me out of it.  I looked at my shirt and remembered the dream.  This was the future, and there was no changing it.  My angle ran towards me and I felt the last tear I would ever feel roll down my cheek.  I mouthed the words 'I love you' while she screamed and told me to stop but it was already the future; I had already pulled the trigger.
Luv2dance1687: you need therapy 
Luv2dance1687: all this has been so sad
BrianJCullinan: your probably right about the therapy
BrianJCullinan: maybe i should put eric's qotes on it
Luv2dance1687: who?

BrianJCullinan: or make me angry after i told you that so i could write better
Luv2dance1687: no not really I dont think like that but I will try
Luv2dance1687: lets see...
BrianJCullinan: well i was thinkin being burned alive
Luv2dance1687: no thats not sexually disgusting you should prolly stay with the same topic as he did
BrianJCullinan: yeah but i don't have to because the challenge is to write something more disgusting so it prolly doesn't matter
BrianJCullinan: they both died
Luv2dance1687: thats true
BrianJCullinan: i'm gonna play with the idea a little, if you think of something tell me

Luv2dance1687: nop she has gained a good amount of weight and looks really healthy

BrianJCullinan: i know
BrianJCullinan: maybe she will come to a football game
Luv2dance1687: oh yeah she does want to come to them
Luv2dance1687: and to our homecoming
BrianJCullinan: thats good
BrianJCullinan: we are going to have a really 'neat' show this year
Luv2dance1687: I told her she could be my date lik
Luv2dance1687: *lol
BrianJCullinan: cool maybe she'll be mine the next time then?
Luv2dance1687: we can share
BrianJCullinan: sounds good
BrianJCullinan: you should tell her that :-D
Luv2dance1687: I will 
BrianJCullinan: can't wait to see the cheerleaders
Luv2dance1687: oh yeah since there so fun to watch
BrianJCullinan: lol not really
BrianJCullinan: but maybe we can do a preformance with them like a lot of other schools
Luv2dance1687: no bands dont perform with the cheerleaders they perform with the drill team
BrianJCullinan: you know this... how?
Luv2dance1687: wich is dancing thats what I have been trying to start for the past two year
Luv2dance1687: I am hoping for one next year
BrianJCullinan: you are going to be on drill team?
BrianJCullinan: that would be exciting
BrianJCullinan: or distracting...
Luv2dance1687: we are hoping to make it a little more exciting than the traditional drill team
BrianJCullinan: that would be fun
Luv2dance1687: maybe not only performing with the band but doing our own thing
BrianJCullinan: i hope you have the oportunity
BrianJCullinan: will you be on it this year?
Luv2dance1687: YES I am in charge of starting it
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: sorry i missed that
BrianJCullinan: were you on it last year?
Luv2dance1687: yeah I kinda figured
Luv2dance1687: there wasnt one last year
BrianJCullinan: oic
Luv2dance1687: did you ever see dancers on the field 
BrianJCullinan: well i just thought maybe there was but they did preformances elsewhere or at different times of the year
Luv2dance1687: nope they wouldnt fund for it so we couldnt do it
Luv2dance1687: I have tried to start one even b4 I went to pinnacle
BrianJCullinan: well it may be considered fine arts so i am not surprised they just happened to not be able to fund it
Luv2dance1687: it is considered fine arts but since it would be a team we would need funding and a place to practice and perform and they give any extra game time to band or cheer and didnt think we were needed
BrianJCullinan: thats terrible
Luv2dance1687: but no offense I think watching dance is a little more interesting than listening to band
BrianJCullinan: you'd think that
BrianJCullinan: until you see our show this year
BrianJCullinan: its going to awsome
Luv2dance1687: but maybe I only believe that b/c I have danced forever
BrianJCullinan: no affence but dance is too...
Luv2dance1687: too what
BrianJCullinan: i don't know it seems like all the background music is the same or its a recording off the radio, like hip-hop and stuff, but the style and technique difference dance groups use are original
Luv2dance1687: and what school bands make up there own music 
Luv2dance1687: or wasnt it last year you guys played show tunes 
BrianJCullinan: i have a better question how many times have you heard the music we play in band before we played it?
Luv2dance1687: Hello everyone has heard show tunes and every band that plays them plays them the EXACT same but in dance different motions can change the song
BrianJCullinan: i'm not talking about the movement, that is completely original and so is the paths we take on the field and the shapes that we form
BrianJCullinan: but in dance the music doesn't change, and in band hardly anyone has ever heard the songs we play
Luv2dance1687: ok fine you dont believe me when we get back to school you take a poll to see who thinks band is better to listen too at a HS football game or to watch dancing
BrianJCullinan: lol i'm sorry i didn't mean to argue with you
Luv2dance1687: The music doesnt make any difference to dancers its just a beat to count too what matters is the movement
BrianJCullinan: entertainment is entertainment and people will love the game no matter when we put out there
BrianJCullinan: if it were up to me i would put a dancing jesus on the field
BrianJCullinan: lol nvm Eric always says that
Luv2dance1687: k
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry i shouldn't have argued with you
BrianJCullinan: your right it is the motion that stands out
Luv2dance1687: know you shouldnt have b/c you should know you wont win
BrianJCullinan: lol alright
BrianJCullinan: you win
Luv2dance1687: lol
Luv2dance1687: I g2g call Jesica talk to you later

Luv2dance1687: thats ok
Luv2dance1687: I forgot about it actually
BrianJCullinan: its was very narrow minded of me to do so
Luv2dance1687: well I guess I was pretty mean about the band 
BrianJCullinan: its ok, i just wanted to appologize because i didn't want to ruin my chances of taking you out to dinner before they even started
BrianJCullinan: let me know when you get a job ok?
Luv2dance1687: well I went in yesterday and they told me they werent hiring
BrianJCullinan: oh thats to bad
BrianJCullinan: but there are plenty of other places there must be somewhere else you want to work right?
Luv2dance1687: no I am very picky
BrianJCullinan: oh
Luv2dance1687: lauren banned me from working at paradise bakery
Luv2dance1687: with her
BrianJCullinan: why?
BrianJCullinan: you guys get in trouble?
Luv2dance1687: which I think would be fun to work with her
BrianJCullinan: why won't she let you work there?
Luv2dance1687: oh some stupid reason she likes this guy that works there and shes afraid I'll "steal" him from her
Luv2dance1687: which I would never do
BrianJCullinan: LOL!
BrianJCullinan: hahaha you should go work there just to make her angry
BrianJCullinan: is she even in a relationship with him?
Luv2dance1687: NO WAY she is one of my best friends
Luv2dance1687: No
Luv2dance1687: Believe me I said hi to him when I walked in the store and she flipped out she said I was flirting
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: do either of you have any idea how much guys like to talk to girls?
BrianJCullinan: even if a guy isn't attracted to a girl he'll still act like he is if the girl opens up and talks to him
Luv2dance1687: well it wasnt a big deal though all I said was hi
Luv2dance1687: and I only said it b/c he was standing right there and I didnt want to be rude
BrianJCullinan: thats one of the biggest problems in high school in my opinion and somewhat immature, girls and guys for that matter always think that the person they like isn't going to want to talk
BrianJCullinan: yeah i know
BrianJCullinan: but i guess i'm saying this as a suggestion for her
Luv2dance1687: yeah well last year she didnt talk to me for two days cuz she said i flirted to much with the guy she liked in our english class
BrianJCullinan: if she really wanted wanted a boyfriend, and this goes for you to, i would strongly suggest just talking to the guy you like, i always find it amusing when my friends are like omg do you think he would want to talk to me? no i dont want to be embarrased
BrianJCullinan: did she know the guy personally or did she just think he was hott?  because if she just liked him because he was good looking, then there is really no reason for her to be jelous
BrianJCullinan: i am very surprised you don't have a boyfriend, your even more outgiong then a lot of your friends i am sure, it should be easy for you to find someone to date for a while, or maybe just a guy to hang with when your bored?

Luv2dance1687: yeah
BrianJCullinan: or yourself?
BrianJCullinan: oh really?
Luv2dance1687: definitely not me
BrianJCullinan: sometimes proffesionals are wrong
BrianJCullinan: we've never built a computer that didn't work
Luv2dance1687: I dont really know I think  my mom tried too and it crashed again
Luv2dance1687: who biulds computers?
BrianJCullinan: anyways i was saying, i'm surprised the both of you don't have boyfriends
Luv2dance1687: builds*
BrianJCullinan: my step fazsha and i
Luv2dance1687: oh 
Luv2dance1687: I have come to the conclusion that I am more of a friend type and not the girlfriend type
BrianJCullinan: you want us to get you some prices?
BrianJCullinan: don't even say that
BrianJCullinan: thats terrible
BrianJCullinan: how many guys have you talked to that you liked?
Luv2dance1687: all of them
BrianJCullinan: oh really?
BrianJCullinan: none of them liked you back?
Luv2dance1687: I am not shy around guys I know and I dont like them until I know them so I talk to them
Luv2dance1687: I dont think so
BrianJCullinan: i can't believe that *bangs head hard on table* why not!
BrianJCullinan: your so beautiful, i can't be the only one that likes you because of your personality AND good looks!
BrianJCullinan: something must be wrong but i haven't figured out what it is
Luv2dance1687: I dont know the only thing that a guy has said to me that comes close to him even remotely liking me was about my looks
Luv2dance1687: so I dont know maybe I dont have that great a personality
Luv2dance1687: and by  the way the comment about my looks wasnt even that nice
BrianJCullinan: what do you mean?
Luv2dance1687: well it wasnt like your very pretty.. it was youve gotta nice rack
BrianJCullinan: no no no your taking it all wrong
Luv2dance1687: and to make it worse he pretty much told my entire chemistry class in the process
BrianJCullinan: i said you are good looking
BrianJCullinan: maybe we just have different opinions of what it means, but that works to, you ARE very pretty
Luv2dance1687: what?
BrianJCullinan: we have different opinions on when 'your good looking' means
Luv2dance1687: The guy said to me quote Youve gotta a nice rack" personally Id rather be told I was good looking 
BrianJCullinan: oh sorry
BrianJCullinan: nvm
Luv2dance1687: I am very confused
BrianJCullinan: oh i thought you said i wasn't very nice by saying your good looking
BrianJCullinan: don't be i'm the one thats confused
BrianJCullinan: i missed a message that you sent me is what happened, just ignore what i said
BrianJCullinan: he said that to the entire class?
Luv2dance1687: oh no no thats a nice compliment I dont think a comlpiment about my boobs is very heartfelt
Luv2dance1687: pretty much
BrianJCullinan: lol i know thats a terrible thing to say
BrianJCullinan: did you smack him?
Luv2dance1687: no I was too shocked and embarrased to do anything
BrianJCullinan: if i were there i would have hit him for you
BrianJCullinan: i'm not kidding, thats not a cool thing to say
Luv2dance1687: believe me I agree
Luv2dance1687: and he thought I should take it as a compliment
BrianJCullinan: lol, what a jerk
BrianJCullinan: and thats definatly NOT why i are anyone else should like you
Luv2dance1687: oh thank you
Luv2dance1687: thats how I felt
BrianJCullinan: what i mean is, a relationship should be based on personality and a connection between two people, not all about there appearence
BrianJCullinan: sure its nice to be with someone your attracted to physically but thats not why two people should be with eachother
BrianJCullinan: anyways i have a trumpet lesson
BrianJCullinan: g2g, have a nice day
BrianJCullinan: i hope you find someone
Luv2dance1687: bye 
Luv2dance1687: thanks

BrianJCullinan: How are you?
Luv2dance1687: oh ok lol
Luv2dance1687: pretty good
Luv2dance1687: kinda ready for school to start again
Luv2dance1687: what about you
BrianJCullinan: I'm talking to a friend of mine about alternatives for finding a perfectly modeled woman.
BrianJCullinan: Pretty interesting really.
BrianJCullinan: Where would you look to find a perfect boyfriend?
Luv2dance1687: what is a perfectly moeled women
Luv2dance1687: abercrombie and fitch
Luv2dance1687: no jk I dont know
BrianJCullinan: Seriously, would you find your dream guy at school?  Or in the movies maybe?
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: What is a perfectly modeled woman you ask?  Well you, or a character out of a video game.
Luv2dance1687: prolly at school
BrianJCullinan: Really? You have someone in mind?
Luv2dance1687: a character out of a video game?
BrianJCullinan: Someone that meets your every standard?
Luv2dance1687: and a fake women with a gun and big breasts meets your standards
BrianJCullinan: Well its different for everyone where they would find the perfect mate, but i can't imagine finding a perfect girl at school.
BrianJCullinan: I don't like anyone
Luv2dance1687: so you would look somewhere like the movies
BrianJCullinan: LOL the fake gun and big breasts sound good, but video game characters have simulated personalities too.
BrianJCullinan: Well maybe the movies, and then i watch ET and find out how many kids they have, kind of ruins it.
Luv2dance1687: lol
Luv2dance1687: I thought you meant meet a girl at the movie theater
BrianJCullinan: I like the girl i have on my desktop.
BrianJCullinan: Lol oh.
Luv2dance1687: and that would be...?
BrianJCullinan: No i mean actor/ actress
BrianJCullinan: Just a girl from a video game, its just like a movie but without the ET coverage.
Luv2dance1687: well then Id have to say orlando bloom 
BrianJCullinan: Same thing kind of, only shes 2D
BrianJCullinan: lol i've heard that one before.
Luv2dance1687: well hes perfect
Luv2dance1687: but in real life how do expect to find a perfectly modeled woman
BrianJCullinan: Yeah, hes a good guy, i can see why girls are head over heal for him.
BrianJCullinan: Well i don't expect to find the perfect woman.
BrianJCullinan: I can only look so far, you know?
Luv2dance1687: good cuz youll be looking forever
Luv2dance1687: for the perfect woman I mean
BrianJCullinan: Yeah i supose, but perfect to me does mean perfect to everyone.
Luv2dance1687: huh?
BrianJCullinan: sorry its late
Luv2dance1687: ok
BrianJCullinan: i could find someone perfect in my eyes, but not in someone elses
BrianJCullinan: I might find a woman who i could love for eternity, someone else might hate her.  But for now all i or you or anyone else can do is wait
Luv2dance1687: yeah I guess
BrianJCullinan: And eventually you'll find the perfect man.
BrianJCullinan: Right now you may not have even a boyfriend to wrap around your finger, but eventually you'll find someone
Luv2dance1687: yeah but hell probably be out of my reach by about 3 inches like every other guy
BrianJCullinan: Someone right for you, someone who wouldn't trade you for anyone, and eventually you'll marry off, and i'll never hear from you again.
Luv2dance1687: Thats not true
BrianJCullinan: I supose i should be as great of friend i can be until that happens.
Luv2dance1687: Ill keep in touch 
BrianJCullinan: I hope.
Luv2dance1687: well if I dont you better
BrianJCullinan: I will try
BrianJCullinan: I should send you a picture of the girl i like
BrianJCullinan: I mean the video game girl.
Luv2dance1687: does she go to pinnacle?
Luv2dance1687: oh dont bother
BrianJCullinan: you'd think shes pretty
Luv2dance1687: not if shes a cartoon
BrianJCullinan: Its more like art really
BrianJCullinan: Art that i have an appritiation for...
Luv2dance1687: yeah dont be obsessing over a video game character please it scares me
BrianJCullinan: I'm not obssesed!
Luv2dance1687: oh really 
BrianJCullinan: I just think that her simulated personality is inspiring
BrianJCullinan: Seriously let me send you a picture
Luv2dance1687: what personality
BrianJCullinan: Well her simulated personality in the game is attractive.
Luv2dance1687: whatever you go on being obsessed with her "personality"
BrianJCullinan: Its just like when you watch a movie, that not how the person really is in real life, but its still atractive
Luv2dance1687: shes oh... I dont know the word... FAKE
BrianJCullinan: Well yes i agree
BrianJCullinan: she is, but so are actors
Luv2dance1687: anyway listen to this story

BrianJCullinan: ok?
Luv2dance1687: anyway the other day I was talking to him and we were having a great convo and he mentioned he works at Just for feet and I was like oh wow I am going to DR this week maybe Ill come in to visit...

BrianJCullinan: ok?
Luv2dance1687: so what should I do
BrianJCullinan: Do you like him?  Still?
Luv2dance1687: I only went to visit him b/c I was there and havent seen him in a while
Luv2dance1687: I dont know
BrianJCullinan: Then everything is fine, if he gets to close just tell him that you don't really feel that way, but you'd like to keep in touch

Luv2dance1687: yeah he is scary though

BrianJCullinan: no i haven't asked her out YET
BrianJCullinan: lol weatly is a jackass

Luv2dance1687: is she just immature about it
LittlePNutss: kind of
LittlePNutss: no, just inexperienced

Luv2dance1687: thats what i meant

LittlePNutss: i am not sure
Luv2dance1687: you need to talk to her and straighten things out b/c if you give up she is gonna give up
LittlePNutss: i'm going to try not to give up, and we were just talking about it
LittlePNutss: and she says she wants to hold hands and hug, but never "makes the move" i suppose
Luv2dance1687: well most girls dont
LittlePNutss: come to the centenial home game and see me play my soli that i earned today
LittlePNutss: well yeah i wouldn't expect her to make the "first move" but she just doesn't ever come to talk to me
LittlePNutss: we will both be standing there with no one else around, and she won't say a word to me
Luv2dance1687: i go to all the homegames so i will be there
LittlePNutss: ok
