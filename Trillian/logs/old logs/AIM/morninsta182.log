[04/08/2004 08:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: like a western scene
[04/08/2004 08:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and we might be willing to pay for it

[04/08/2004 08:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean not like something in the thousands
[04/08/2004 08:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: but maybe 50 to 100 dollars
[04/08/2004 08:44 PM] Danica: oh ya def not

[04/08/2004 08:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't know
[04/08/2004 08:46 PM] Danica: lol i dunno it depends on how detailed the painting is and how much research on what u want she would have to do
[04/08/2004 08:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: well ask her how much she would sell a painting for, not one that she has on her walls obviously, but a new one from a western picture

[04/08/2004 08:52 PM] Danica: ok i just asked her..and she appreciates the offer, but she doesnt really think she has the time to do it. b/c usually it takes her a couple of months to do a painting and shed have to research it and what not
