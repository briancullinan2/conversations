[19/12/2004 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: merely because i was trying to explain the importance of keeping good relationships with you friends
[19/12/2004 12:24 AM] Erika: no i am not cause it is me who said it not her  and  i am 17 and am old enough to know  i have had enough boyfriends to know about all of this but still u are being a jerk
[19/12/2004 12:25 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes, that's it, i'm being a jerk for giving some valuable advice
[19/12/2004 12:25 AM] Erika: and  u were being mean and makeing fun of brianna. i mean i dont know her to well but still that is just wrong
[19/12/2004 12:25 AM] BrianJCullinan: how was i making fun of brianna?
[19/12/2004 12:26 AM] Erika: how is that valuable
[19/12/2004 12:26 AM] Erika: well ok so its not making fun but u r saying stuff that erika doesn't appreciate
[19/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: all i am saying is that Eric and Brianna spend a lot of time together, and don't spend very much time with other friends
[19/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: then i corrected myself and said, i know eric doesn't spend very much time with his other friends
[19/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: for example he and jeffrey used to talk all the time, now they hardly talk at ll
[19/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: all
[19/12/2004 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: why don't you press the F2 key, and list all of the times i said something mean
[19/12/2004 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: because i don't see how you can think i am a jerk when i just expressing my thoughts on how they need to spend more time with other people
[19/12/2004 12:28 AM] Erika: BrianJCullinan: he spends all his time with his little girlfriend, doesn't spend any time with his real friends
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok?
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] Erika: what do u mean by little gf huh?
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] Erika: and real friends
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] Erika: how is she not real
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: i meant that she isn't very tall
[19/12/2004 12:29 AM] Erika: yeah sure
[19/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i said that to emphasize my anger towards how much time he and I spend together
[19/12/2004 12:30 AM] Erika: and just cause they dont talk much so what things change over time do u talk to all of ur friend even one  u had in elemntery no things change ppl change  so deal
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: by that i would be forced to assume friends don't mean very much to you
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: you're a freshman right?
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: can't remember
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] Erika: i am 17
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] Erika: smart one
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: sam from band?
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: in pit?
[19/12/2004 12:31 AM] Erika: i am a junior and  yeah friends  do mean a lot to me 
[19/12/2004 12:32 AM] Erika: why do u think i cry over not being able to see them cause they are all in another state besides erika
[19/12/2004 12:32 AM] BrianJCullinan: hmm well, if you were friends with a person for 4 years would you want a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship to get in the way of that?
[19/12/2004 12:32 AM] Erika: JUST STOP!!!
[19/12/2004 12:32 AM] BrianJCullinan: hmm, well that's what i thought
[19/12/2004 12:33 AM] Erika: ok  i have had a friend or 7 years now and we  never let a boyfriend  get in the way of it
[19/12/2004 12:33 AM] Erika: I (erika) said just stop
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] Erika: i have to be willing to let a gilr or guy get in the way of  ur freindship with him
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: that just proves me point and leads back to what i originally said
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] Erika: girl*
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: Eric is letting his girlfriend get in the way of our relationship
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] Erika: nbo it dosent  in less ur point is that  u are willing to let her  get in the way
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: because he doesn't spend very much time with his other friends
[19/12/2004 12:34 AM] Erika: aka you
[19/12/2004 12:35 AM] BrianJCullinan: me or jeffrey or the other friends he may have
[19/12/2004 12:35 AM] Erika:  ur just being selfish just leads back to ur point
[19/12/2004 12:35 AM] BrianJCullinan: i suggest you both get some sleep, its getting awfully late and you seem tired
[19/12/2004 12:35 AM] Erika: NO JUST MAD
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] BrianJCullinan: hmm, well you should calm down
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] BrianJCullinan: i wasn't trying to upset anyone
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] Erika: why  ur just leting her get in the way
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] BrianJCullinan: just trying to have a friendly conversation with Erika
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] BrianJCullinan: because shes the one that said "hey" to me
[19/12/2004 12:36 AM] Erika: all u have to do is call him up and ask he he wants to hang out  i mean it isnt that hard to just pick up a phone and dial a number
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] Erika: actually  i am the one who said hi
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] BrianJCullinan: maybe you just don't know them very well
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] BrianJCullinan: usually they have plans already
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] BrianJCullinan: Eric doesn't spend very much time with anyone but Brianna
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] Erika: (erika)yeah i know but i have plans with brianna tomorrow so y don't u make plans with eric
[19/12/2004 12:37 AM] Erika: or make them in advance
[19/12/2004 12:38 AM] BrianJCullinan: that's a good idea, but Eric is a little different
[19/12/2004 12:38 AM] Erika: how so if  u dont mind
[19/12/2004 12:38 AM] BrianJCullinan: he doesn't like to do things unless he has planned on them a few days in advance
[19/12/2004 12:38 AM] Erika: perfect then make plans in advance
[19/12/2004 12:39 AM] BrianJCullinan: well, making plans for tomorrow would not be enough in advance for Eric
[19/12/2004 12:39 AM] BrianJCullinan: but if he isn't doing anything we will probably play games together
[19/12/2004 12:39 AM] Erika: then call him and think ahead for another day
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: call him now?
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: this late at night, i don't think so
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] Erika: y don't u talk to him online
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: why don't we stop talking about this
[19/12/2004 12:40 AM] Erika: yeah y don't we
[19/12/2004 12:41 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'd like to talk to Erika, if i am not already

[01/09/2005 09:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: almost gross together because their always all over eachother
[01/09/2005 09:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: she feels the need to sit on his lap everywhere
[01/09/2005 09:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: its just so weird
[01/09/2005 09:31 PM] Erika: I KNOW!
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: she is always touching him
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: ahh
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: its kind of annoying
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: makes me shudder
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: it is annoying
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: i want to say something but i don't want her to get mad at me
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: eric gets mad at me when i say something
[01/09/2005 09:33 PM] Erika: she is going to die without him next year
[01/09/2005 09:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah really
[01/09/2005 09:35 PM] Erika: its like she will only hang out with me when its convenient for her, like when eric can't or she needs a place to stay after school
[01/09/2005 09:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you think they will break up?
[01/09/2005 09:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: same with eric
[01/09/2005 09:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: i have to coax him into doing anything away from her
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] Erika: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] Erika: me too
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: most the time i suggest he bring her places anyways just so he doesn't get mad at me
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] Erika: like at the service she said she was gonna go but then i am guessing since eric wasn't she decided not to but if he was she would be all over it
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] Erika: it makes me sick
[01/09/2005 09:36 PM] Erika: arg
[01/09/2005 09:37 PM] Erika: and about them breaking up...i think it would be best just because they are way to colse and its only her 2nd bf and erics 1st?
[01/09/2005 09:37 PM] Erika: they need to look around a bit more
[01/09/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah definitely
[01/09/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is the first relationship thing
[01/09/2005 09:38 PM] Erika: has he ever told u he loves her?
[01/09/2005 09:39 PM] Erika: well u don't have to answer that...but what do they know what love is
[01/09/2005 09:39 PM] Erika: i mean really
[01/09/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't know
[01/09/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: it ticks me off
[01/09/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and they definitely do NOT know what love is
[01/09/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: its more like lust
[01/09/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:41 PM] Erika: there will be plenty of girls at nau for him next year and i don't think he should let their relationship get in his way of "exploring his options"
[01/09/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: i was thinking the same thing
[01/09/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: brb mom needs to talk

[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] Erika: i know that sounds mean
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] Erika: but she didn't make an effort to be friends with me
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: i understand
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: you need other friends, not her
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: shes treating you very badly

[01/11/2005 09:37 PM] Erika: u r the only one who knows how i feel
[01/11/2005 09:37 PM] Erika: we need to tell them!
[01/11/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't know
[01/11/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: give it a little while longer
[01/11/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe they will break up and be better off
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] Erika: we are kinda being selfish
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] Erika: they like being together
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] Erika: but they don't have to be rude
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah, but what will happen when they are not together anymore
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: i doubt it will last forever
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: and when they break up someday, then they will be alone
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: yeah
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it would be somewhat our fault
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: and then they will wonder y
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: for not stopping it sooner
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: yeah thats what i was thinking
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: i say we tell them how rude they are being
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] Erika: and thats it
[01/11/2005 09:42 PM] Erika: just be like "if u guys are gonna act this way then tell me now because i have better things to do then be ignored by u"
[01/11/2005 09:42 PM] Erika: that sounds kinda mean though
[01/11/2005 09:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am talking to him about it
[01/11/2005 09:43 PM] Erika: are u really
[01/11/2005 09:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i don't want him to be hurt anymore
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] Erika: anymore? what?

[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: want me to send it to you?
[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] Erika: sure
[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: [01/11/2005 09:38 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't care 
 [01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i get it
 [01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: you don't care about anything but Brianna
 [01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: i completely understand
 [01/11/2005 09:39 PM] EricGFoehner: don't even bring her into this
 [01/11/2005 09:39 PM] EricGFoehner: she has nothing to do with it 
 [01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: except that she didn't go either
 [01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and she hardly talks to her friends anymore, just like you
 [01/11/2005 09:40 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't have any friends brian 
 [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: only you 
[01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: or how all you do in the mornings is pay attention to her, and hardly try to have a conversation with me
 [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: well you're not going to have any if you keep acting like this
 [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: what the fuck 
 [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: you could have friends if you spent time with other people instead of just her
 [01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: why do you always bring everything back to this 
 [01/11/2005 09:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: what should i say? "go ahead, don't try to make other friends.  when you break up with Brianna then you will have no one."  Is that what i should say?  I want you to have more, you mean more to me then she means to you Eric
 [01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if you're happy, and you think your "in love".  Then don't change anything because of me
 [01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: really don't change
[01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: [01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: do your own thing
 [01/11/2005 09:44 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
 [01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll act even more like you and just "not care"
 [01/11/2005 09:45 PM] EricGFoehner: what is your problem 
 [01/11/2005 09:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: nothing, i don't have a problem, i don't care
 [01/11/2005 09:46 PM] EricGFoehner: all i can say is wow 
 [01/11/2005 09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
 [01/11/2005 09:46 PM] EricGFoehner: why do you like fighting about this all of the time?
[01/11/2005 09:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: [01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't "like" it
 [01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: like i said, i don't want you to be alone when you don't have her anymore
[01/11/2005 09:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: [01/11/2005 09:49 PM] EricGFoehner: this is the life i have chosen, when i lose her ill be a friendless failure, drop out of college, take after my dad and become an alcoholic then shoot myself in the head 
 [01/11/2005 09:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not going to let you
 [01/11/2005 09:50 PM] EricGFoehner: why i would have driven you away too
 [01/11/2005 09:50 PM] EricGFoehner: i wont have anyone but my friend budwieser 
 [01/11/2005 09:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: unlike Brianna, Eric, i am not going to leave you when someone better comes along
 [01/11/2005 09:51 PM] EricGFoehner: wow
 [01/11/2005 09:51 PM] EricGFoehner: you just said you would
[01/11/2005 09:56 PM] Erika: wow

[01/27/2005 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: BrianJCullinan:     that's a pretty gross away message  
 BrianJCullinan:     had your mom seen that message?  
 brianna:     gross?  
 BrianJCullinan:     Brianna: doing stuff with Eric on my bed  
 BrianJCullinan:     yeah  
 BrianJCullinan:     that's very wrong  
 brianna:     yeah what  
 brianna:     you know you wish you could do stuff with him  
 BrianJCullinan:     and although you may not realize this, but not everyone cares to know that kind of shit  
 brianna:     that you want to do things with Eric?  
 BrianJCullinan:     no that you are doing things with eric on your bed  
 BrianJCullinan:     no one cares  
 BrianJCullinan:     and no one likes to hear about it  
 brianna:     well obviously you do  
 BrianJCullinan:     so why would you put it in your message?  
 brianna:     what  
 BrianJCullinan:     i am just doing to right thing, and bring it to your attention  
 brianna:     well personally I think you are only saying something because you personally dislike it  
 BrianJCullinan:     i don't think anyone wants to know you are doing stuff on your bed with your boyfriend  
 BrianJCullinan:     shall we ask for someone else's opinion?  
 brianna:     I didn't say I thought people would cafe  
 brianna:     *care  
 BrianJCullinan:     well personally I think you are only saying something because you personally dislike it  
 BrianJCullinan:     you said that  
 BrianJCullinan:     implying that i am the only one that dislikes it  
 BrianJCullinan:     yeah yur dumb  
 brianna:     meaning I think you care  
 BrianJCullinan:     by saying that i dislike it?  
 BrianJCullinan:     you're completely contradicting yourself  
 brianna:     maybe we did it to see if you would say anything  
 brianna:     why do you hate the idea of me and Eric together so much?  
 brianna:     you're such a trumpet player  
 brianna:     do you ever discuss things?  
 brianna:     I put the away message up because I was pretty sure it would upset you and I want to talk about why it upsets you  
 BrianJCullinan:     sry i thought you put it up because you act like a stupid little girl  
 brianna:     oh  
 brianna:     ok  
 brianna:     well, what do you think of me and Eric's relationship  
 brianna:     you act like a stupid little boy

[03/17/2005 05:39 PM] Me: it would be really great if scott could just drive there and we could put another kid in that car
[03/17/2005 05:40 PM] Me: are you there?
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Me: come-on talk to me
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Erika: sorry
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Erika: other people are on talking
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Erika: um...i don't know who im driving with
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Erika: w/e car there is room for people i will go there
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Me: :-(
[03/17/2005 05:41 PM] Me: but i want you to go with me, there might not be room in our car though
[03/17/2005 05:42 PM] Erika: well then i can't go with u...i guess...idk
[03/17/2005 05:42 PM] Me: it is between me and your mom
[03/17/2005 05:42 PM] Me: ask her who she is planning on going with ok?
[03/17/2005 05:43 PM] Erika: i don't think she knows
[03/17/2005 05:44 PM] Me: then have her read this
[03/17/2005 05:45 PM] Me: if she goes with my mom she still has 2 adults to socialize with, in this case i would be able to go in suzi's car and have friends to talk to, but if she goes with suzi then she will have to put up with 4 kids and i will be stuck with my brothers
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: but its her choice
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Erika: lol
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: i just don't want to be bore for 5 hours going there
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: *bangs head on table*
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Erika: well suzie will be stuck with all the kids
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Erika: unless!!
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Erika: we just have a kids car
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: scott drives and we put another kid in there
[03/17/2005 05:46 PM] Erika: and the other one for adults
[03/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: yes
[03/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: + chase
[03/17/2005 05:47 PM] Erika: lol
[03/17/2005 05:47 PM] Erika: yeah
[03/17/2005 05:49 PM] Me: i should call suzi and ask
[03/17/2005 05:49 PM] Erika: i just asked my mom
[03/17/2005 05:49 PM] Me: what did she think?
[03/17/2005 05:49 PM] Me: "not a good idea"
[03/17/2005 05:49 PM] Erika: and she said that we were going in suzis car...and i think she was confused about the whole kids car thing
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Erika: shes like suzi is driving one car
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Me: lol
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Erika: and i was like what if scott drives the other car
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Erika: lol
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Erika: idk
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Me: hmmm
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Me: i should call suzi
[03/17/2005 05:50 PM] Erika: if u want
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Erika: or just ask your mom
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Erika: its really up to your mom and suzi
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Me: yeah
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Me: my mom said it wasn't a good idea
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Me: having all those kids in one car
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Erika: lol
[03/17/2005 05:51 PM] Erika: probably not such a good one...are u going to mexico!?
[03/17/2005 05:52 PM] Me: yeah

[03/17/2005 05:58 PM] Me: have you started packing?
[03/17/2005 05:58 PM] Erika: no
[03/17/2005 05:58 PM] Me: you aren't very talkative
[03/17/2005 05:58 PM] Me: am i not keeping your interest?
[03/17/2005 05:59 PM] Erika: no im just looking up the weather
[03/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: we are going to prom together you know, its a pretty big deal, and i wouldn't have asked you if i didn't really like you
[03/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: ah i c
[03/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: weather is good

[03/17/2005 06:00 PM] Me: its up to you
[03/17/2005 06:00 PM] Me: i want you to be happy
[03/17/2005 06:00 PM] Me: i don't want there to be any awkward situations, and if you think that going with Eric and Brianna would cause a lot of those, maybe we shouldn't go with them
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: but you decide
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Erika: me?
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: ask Claire what she is doing tomorrow
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Erika: what she is doing tomorrow?
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Erika: y?
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: ask her tomorrow
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Erika: o
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: what she is doing for prom

[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: lol
[03/17/2005 06:01 PM] Erika: i already know
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: you haven't told me!?
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Erika: yes i did!
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Erika: they are going in a limo
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: what then?
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: oh
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: but where are they going to eat?
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: limos suck
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Erika: and they are going to eat at 5 in diner
[03/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: they cost way to much and they aren't even that great
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: maybe if you are luck you will get one with a DVD player and tv screens
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: but chances are, you will probably just get a plain one with bench seats and a driver that doesn't speak english
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: i would know, i see them all the time
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: they are boring
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: and don't even look good on the outside most of the time
[03/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: they are almost always old looking
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: because people can't afford to maintain them
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Erika: yeah i am fine going in a regular car
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: you should tell Claire that
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: not to waste her money
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Erika: well shes going with a bunch of people
[03/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: what they should really do is get an escort with a new Escalade, she acts like shes black, she should like that better
[03/17/2005 06:05 PM] Erika: hey be nice
[03/17/2005 06:05 PM] Me: lol
[03/17/2005 06:05 PM] Me: i didn't say black people are bad
[03/17/2005 06:05 PM] Erika: so still be nice
[03/17/2005 06:06 PM] Me: they just have a thing with using escalades in music videos

[03/24/2005 07:58 PM] Me: ok
[03/24/2005 07:59 PM] Erika: which brings me to y i didn't spend a lot of time with you
[03/24/2005 07:59 PM] Erika: because i knew you were just going to touch me

[03/24/2005 08:00 PM] Me: ok
[03/24/2005 08:01 PM] Me: maybe if you spent more time with me, i wouldn't touch you, i just wanted your attention, and you ignored me the whole time
[03/24/2005 08:01 PM] *** Auto-response from Erika: I am away from my computer right now.
[03/24/2005 08:01 PM] Me: remember how you felt last night when i was mad at you?  remember how upset you were?  that is how i felt the entire time
[03/24/2005 08:03 PM] Me: i felt rejected, and all i did was made it worse, but you were so sure that "all i would do is touch you", you didn't make it any better
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Erika: i didn't make it better because i stayed away from you?
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Me: because you ignored me
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Me: and did pay any attention to me
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Me: and made me feel alone
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Erika: because you kept touching me
[03/24/2005 08:06 PM] Me: and unwanted
[03/24/2005 08:07 PM] Erika: and when you said that i was spending too much time with your brother that made me really mad
[03/24/2005 08:07 PM] Me: what did you expect me to say! you spent more time with him in one day that you did the entire week with me!
[03/24/2005 08:08 PM] Me: you have no idea how that made me feel
[03/24/2005 08:08 PM] Erika: well i didn't go on vacation to spend time with you i went there to have fun!
[03/24/2005 08:09 PM] Me: i know
[03/24/2005 08:09 PM] Me: and i ruined it
[03/24/2005 08:10 PM] Erika: and i did not spend all day with your brother
[03/24/2005 08:11 PM] Me: ok well maybe i exaggerated, but you exaggerate when you say "all i did was touch you"
[03/24/2005 08:11 PM] Erika: well you did keep hanging on me
[03/24/2005 08:12 PM] Erika: and i told you to stop
[03/24/2005 08:12 PM] Erika: and you wouldn't
[03/24/2005 08:12 PM] Erika: and do u think i like scott
[03/24/2005 08:12 PM] Me: i didn't want to ignore you like you did me
[03/24/2005 08:13 PM] Erika: because i don't
[03/24/2005 08:13 PM] Me: that's why i payed so much attention to you
[03/24/2005 08:13 PM] Me: because you made me feel bad by ignoring me, and i didn't want to do the same thing to you
[03/24/2005 08:13 PM] Me: i wanted to make you feel wanted
[03/24/2005 08:13 PM] Me: and showing affection towards you was the best i could think of
[03/24/2005 08:14 PM] Erika: you don't have to make me feel wanted
[03/24/2005 08:14 PM] Me: so you want me to ignore you that way you did to me?
[03/24/2005 08:14 PM] Me: like when i walked to class without you 1 day out of all year and you got upset
[03/24/2005 08:14 PM] *** Auto-response from Erika: POCO...
[03/24/2005 08:15 PM] Me: you said that you didn't know how it felt to be rejected, well now you do, it felt the same way you felt last night when i yelled at you
[03/24/2005 08:15 PM] Me: *feels the same way
[03/24/2005 08:16 PM] Me: i don't want you to feel that way, no one should feel that way, so all i could do was be affectionate and show you that i care about you, but you don't seem to like that either
[03/24/2005 08:20 PM] Me: understand my actions now?
[03/24/2005 08:20 PM] Me: i never meant to hurt you
[03/24/2005 08:40 PM] Erika: i got to go

[05/05/2005 09:02 PM] Me: yup
[05/05/2005 09:05 PM] Erika: monkies on ice!
[05/05/2005 09:06 PM] Me: what?
[05/05/2005 09:06 PM] Erika: what?
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: i hate when people point at their wrist while asking for the time....I know where my watch is pal, where the f*** is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the toilet is? 
  
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too". F***ing right! What good is a cake if you can't eat it?
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: When people say "it's always the last place you look". Of course it is. Why the f*** would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: People who ask "Can I ask you a question?". Didn't really give me a choice there, did you sunshine?
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: When something is 'new and improved!'. Which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: When people say "life is short". What the f***?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever f***ing does!! What can you do that's longer?
[05/05/2005 09:11 PM] Erika: :-D
[05/05/2005 09:12 PM] Me: what the f***?
[05/05/2005 09:12 PM] Me: where did that come from
[05/05/2005 09:12 PM] Me: ?

[05/05/2005 09:14 PM] Me: ok
[05/05/2005 09:15 PM] Erika: do you want to hear 30 things to make you smile
[05/05/2005 09:17 PM] Erika: do you?
[05/05/2005 09:18 PM] Me: ok
[05/05/2005 09:18 PM] Me: lets hear it
[05/05/2005 09:19 PM] Erika: 1.) My husband and I divorced over religious differences..... He thought he was God and I didn't. 
  2.) I don't suffer from insanity; I enjoy every minute of it. 
  3.) I work hard because millions on welfare depend on Me! 
  4.) Some people are alive only because it's illegal to kill them. 
  5.) I used to have a handle on life, but it broke. 
  
[05/05/2005 09:19 PM] Erika: 6.) Don't take life too seriously; No one gets out alive. 
  7.) You're just jealous because the voices only talk to me. 
  8.) Beauty is in the eye of the beer holder. 
  9.) Earth is the insane asylum for the universe. 
  10.) I'm not a complete idiot -- Some parts are missing. 
  11.) Out of my mind. Back in five minutes. 
  12.) NyQuil, the stuffy, sneezy, why-the-heck-is-the-room- spinning medicine. 
  13.) God must love stupid people; He made so many. 
  14.) The gene pool could use a little chlorine. 
  15.) Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.
[05/05/2005 09:19 PM] Erika: 16.) Ever stop to think, and forget to start again? 
  17.) Being "over the hill" is much better than being under it! 
  18.) Wrinkled Was Not One of the Things I Wanted to Be When I Grew up. 
  19.) Procrastinate Now! 
  20.) I Have a Degree in Liberal Arts; Do You Want Fries With That? 
  21.) A hangover is the wrath of grapes. 
  22.) A journey of a thousand miles begins with a cash advance 
  23.) Stupidity is not a handicap. Park elsewhere! 
  24.) They call it PMS because Mad Cow Disease was already taken. 
  25.) He who dies with the most toys is nonetheless dead
[05/05/2005 09:19 PM] Erika: 26.) A picture is worth a thousand words, but it uses up three thousand times the memory. 
  27.) Ham and eggs. A day's work for a chicken, a life time commitment for a pig. 
  28.) The trouble with life is there's no background music. 
  29.) The original point and click interface was a Smith and Wesson. 
  30.) I smile because I don't know what the hell is going on.

[05/05/2005 09:27 PM] Erika: how am i tempting
[05/05/2005 09:28 PM] Me: well you can't just look beautiful all the time and expect no one to pay attention to you
[05/05/2005 09:28 PM] Erika: the front is the got band part and the back is the "someday..."
[05/05/2005 09:28 PM] Erika: thanks

[05/05/2005 09:31 PM] Me: but i'm also always sincere
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Me: its a funny idea, but its not really supporting the team
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Me: it kind of says, "we will take over"
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: its a band shirt
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: whats your point
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Erika: is it too harsh
[05/05/2005 09:32 PM] Me: but the band is supposed to be a spirit organization, not a take over the game organization
[05/05/2005 09:33 PM] Me: you can submit more then one idea
[05/05/2005 09:33 PM] Erika: but then i have to say how big the words are supposed to be
[05/05/2005 09:33 PM] Erika: and thats going to take a while
[05/05/2005 09:33 PM] Me: not really
[05/05/2005 09:34 PM] Me: they will also resize it when you submit it
[05/05/2005 09:34 PM] Erika: well what do you do when u size it
[05/05/2005 09:34 PM] Erika: what are you supposed to say
[05/05/2005 09:35 PM] Me: say the Got Band part is going to be 2 inches big

[05/05/2005 09:51 PM] Me: you will just have to stretch it
[05/05/2005 09:52 PM] Me: they might assign me to recreate the winner anyways

[06/02/2005 12:37 PM] Erika: because i don't need to lay down
[06/02/2005 12:37 PM] Me: oh of course not
[06/02/2005 12:38 PM] Me: god forbid you agree with anything i say

[06/02/2005 12:38 PM] Erika: i have been laying down all day...i only woke up an hour ago
[06/02/2005 12:39 PM] Erika: its not like im trying to dissagree with everything you say
[06/02/2005 12:39 PM] Me: A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.
[06/02/2005 12:39 PM] Me: well you are
[06/02/2005 12:40 PM] Erika: not on purpose
[06/02/2005 12:40 PM] Me: w/e
[06/02/2005 12:40 PM] Erika: y are you getting angry

[06/02/2005 12:41 PM] Erika: y?
[06/02/2005 12:41 PM] Me: because of you
[06/02/2005 12:41 PM] Erika: y!
[06/02/2005 12:42 PM] Me: because you are sick and don't want to do anything to feel better
[06/02/2005 12:42 PM] Erika: ?
[06/02/2005 12:42 PM] Erika: i don't want ot do anything because i am sick...
[06/02/2005 12:42 PM] Me: and because you said you are going to stay home and read, yet you are still here talking to me
