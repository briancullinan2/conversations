[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Me: ok here is my standpoint
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Megan O: i am bored
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Megan O: and then we can give our lecture
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Katie: no come to my room
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Katie: what brian?
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Megan O: too much walking
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Katie: im listening
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Megan O: me tooo
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Katie: were both here
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Me: what?
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Me: no
[08/30/2005 01:12 PM] Me: here is my method
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Me: i let the girl know that a think she attractive in anyway, for example, she is "pretty" its a good word to use
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Me: not too quick not to agressive
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Katie: yes too quick
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Katie: and too agressive
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Me: so right from the start she already feels like she stands out in a crowd
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Me: girls like to feel special
[08/30/2005 01:13 PM] Katie: special
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Katie: but not like a piece of meat
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Katie: u have a great personality
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Me: so from there i would get to know her, start with small talk, then get into some personality questions and eventually some more personal
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Katie: we just need to polish u
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Katie: megan
[08/30/2005 01:14 PM] Megan O: leave the attraction part till you get to know her
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Katie: yes
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Megan O: if you say hi im brian and i think you are pretty girls think that you just want to have sex or something else
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Megan O: start out entirely jsut getting to know eac other
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Katie: girls are made uncomfterable but being told that they r pretty unless they know u
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Megan O: and then bring in the physical attractions
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Me: i think with that method a girl will be more able to open up if she knows that i want to talk to her or be around her
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Megan O: i hate being told that i am pretty
[08/30/2005 01:15 PM] Megan O: i hate compliments in general because its awkward to react to
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Megan O: and makes you stand out in a negative way sorta
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Katie: exactly
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Katie: u dot know what to do
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Me: and that's why we have such different views
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Megan O: but we are girls!
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Me: its all about the level of maturity
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Katie: i want someone who wants to talk
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Megan O: we know what we are talking about
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Megan O: deffinately
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Katie: yes
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Megan O: and wants to know who i actually am
[08/30/2005 01:16 PM] Katie: and cares about what i care about
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: even if it is only because i do
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: lol
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: thats the best
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: yep
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Me: but i won't be given the opportunity to get to know who you are unless i have a compliment to just pull you in
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: no 
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: no
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: no
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: no
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: not at all
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Me: i've decided i like older women because of people like you
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: you say hi my name is
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: we run away
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: _________
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Katie: we dont run toward
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: and then start a convo
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: then the girl is drawn in from the start
[08/30/2005 01:17 PM] Megan O: 100% guarantee
[08/30/2005 01:18 PM] Katie: exactly
[08/30/2005 01:18 PM] Me: w/e
[08/30/2005 01:18 PM] Katie: and the older the more they r interested in personality
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Me: women also like compliments and i am good at them
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Katie: and u have to have some serious charm
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Katie: yes u r
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Megan O: i hate compliments
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Me: you're weird
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Megan O: i guess i am not a woman
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Katie: ur very good at compliments
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Megan O: i agree with taht
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Katie: dont worry im not either
[08/30/2005 01:19 PM] Megan O: but sometimes you overdo that
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Me: one compliment mid way through developing a relationship is to much?
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Katie: i dont mind in the midle of a convo saying you have amazing eyes or ur r really pretty but not to start one
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Megan O: no
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Megan O: i dont mean that
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Katie: and dont dwell on the compliment
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Megan O: exactly
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Me: dwell?
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Megan O: and dont start a convo with one is definately the key
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Me: don't dwell on trying to teach me social skills
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Katie: after u compliment keep talking
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Katie: bc she wont know what to say and will be uncomfterable
[08/30/2005 01:20 PM] Me: i know who i am, i'm a good friendly outgoing person
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Katie: so if u just keep talking it will be great
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Me: i'm not going to let either of you change that
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Me: so you might as well give up now
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Megan O: fine
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Katie: and i luv ya
[08/30/2005 01:21 PM] Katie: but

[08/30/2005 01:22 PM] Megan O: i still think that i am bored and my room is cleaner than katies though
[08/30/2005 01:22 PM] Me: i've had a girlfriend before, both very different, i'll figure it out without your help and your stupid class

[08/30/2005 01:23 PM] Katie: well if ur not gonna listen were done w u
[08/30/2005 01:23 PM] Megan O: what else do you have to stubbornly rant about
[08/30/2005 01:23 PM] Me: a real gentleman should always be ready with a compliment, so you Megan better learn to like them
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Megan O: i like them when they are original and sincere
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Megan O: but not the normal ones
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: i hate them too
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Megan O: thats just how i am
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: me too
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: as an opener they seem fake
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Megan O: people i have dated realize that and accept it
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Megan O: so that would be real gentlemen for you
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: exactly
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: and opening doors is spectacular
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: dont change that
[08/30/2005 01:24 PM] Katie: brian

[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Me: lets say a guy picks you up for prom, when you answer the door standing nervously there in a gorgeous dress you spent lots of money on and hours getting ready, would you rather a guy say to you, "Wow you look incredible"
[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Me:  or would you rather he say "So i found this rare baseball card on the ground today, oh and you look nice.... " and goes on about something else?
[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Me: that's just an example, i don't think people still collect baseball cards
[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Katie: THATS DIFFERENT
[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Me: shut up no its not
[08/30/2005 01:25 PM] Me: its the same
[08/30/2005 01:26 PM] Katie: were talking every day not a date
[08/30/2005 01:26 PM] Me: so you only want to feel like you look good on a date?
[08/30/2005 01:26 PM] Megan O: that is way differen
[08/30/2005 01:26 PM] Megan O: t
[08/30/2005 01:26 PM] Megan O: prom doesnt count
[08/30/2005 01:27 PM] Katie: and dates r different
[08/30/2005 01:27 PM] Katie: bc she has gotten ready for U not just ready
[08/30/2005 01:27 PM] Megan O: true
[08/30/2005 01:27 PM] Me: dates and prom and developing a relationship with someone are all just as important
[08/30/2005 01:27 PM] Katie: u had better compliment on a date
[08/30/2005 01:28 PM] Megan O: not too much though
[08/30/2005 01:28 PM] Katie: ok so we just need to teach u when to compliment
[08/30/2005 01:28 PM] Me: aboslutely not
[08/30/2005 01:29 PM] Megan O: omg
[08/30/2005 01:29 PM] Me: my problem isn't social skills, it is being honest, i will admit when i find a girl attractive either in appearance or personality i let her know, i want her to feel wanted, you're trying to tell me that's wrong
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: being liked and being wanted for ransome are two completely different things
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: and i am still bored btw
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Katie: not wrong girls are just not used to it
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: with a clean room
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: lol
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Katie: so u have to understand that ur honesty freaks us out
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Katie: and then we run
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: CLEAN ROOM AND CHEERIOS
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Katie: and ur room sucks meg
[08/30/2005 01:30 PM] Megan O: lol
[08/30/2005 01:31 PM] Katie: Frosted mini wheats
[08/30/2005 01:31 PM] Me: i've never had a girl run away from me, so you can stop using that terminology
[08/30/2005 01:31 PM] Katie: apples
[08/30/2005 01:31 PM] Katie: Magan
