[05/15/2004 12:09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i know it's probably hard for you believe, but i really am sorry
[05/15/2004 12:10:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: what ever happened to being friends?
[05/15/2004 12:10:29 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I didn't want to be friends if you still had feelings for me
[05/15/2004 12:10:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, i can't help having feelings for you
[05/15/2004 12:10:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: i still think you're pretty
[05/15/2004 12:11:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i still think you're sweet
[05/15/2004 12:11:47 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, thanks, but I would only want to be friends with you
[05/15/2004 12:11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i still think you're a great person
[05/15/2004 12:12:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: i understand
[05/15/2004 12:12:12 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:12:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: last night when eric was talking to you, he said i had a question to ask you
[05/15/2004 12:13:27 PM] xxhappycynicxx: um, yeah, you can ask whatever you want
[05/15/2004 12:13:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't mean to upset you or anything, i just wanted to know why you broke up with me, you never really explained it before, and i know i should be over this, but it is hard to get over something you don't understand
[05/15/2004 12:14:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: why did you break up with me only a day after i asked you if you were still interested in me?
[05/15/2004 12:14:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: it seemed so sudden?
[05/15/2004 12:14:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: and only a few days before valentines day weekend, when i had made so many great plans for us
[05/15/2004 12:15:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know i fought with you a lot, but i was going to make up for it that friday, and remind you why you fell in love with me in the first place
[05/15/2004 12:15:37 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok, well, we were fighting a lot; you kept saying I wasn't affectionate enough and you weren't even talking to me anymore and I kept trying to convince myself I still was interested in you, but then that day I just realized I couldn't keep lying to myself or you
[05/15/2004 12:16:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: i c, but the reason i fought with you was because, when we were alone you were affectionate, but that wasn't the only thing, you talked to me so much more when we were alone, but at school it got to the point where you wouldn't even come sit with me anymore
[05/15/2004 12:17:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: you said in your letter that you would have broke up with me sooner, that sounds pretty harsh to me, do you mean that when you kissed me, it didn't mean anything?
[05/15/2004 12:18:20 PM] xxhappycynicxx: do you remember why I kissed you the last time?
[05/15/2004 12:19:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: why?
[05/15/2004 12:19:22 PM] xxhappycynicxx: you don't remember?
[05/15/2004 12:19:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: before we broke up you hadn't kissed me for a while
[05/15/2004 12:19:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: why?
[05/15/2004 12:20:48 PM] xxhappycynicxx: no, I kissed you the day I broke up with you, you and eric were talking about something and started laughing and I asked you what it was and you said I won't tell you unless you kiss me so I did and it was the schifty five thing
[05/15/2004 12:21:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: that was the only reason you kissed me?
[05/15/2004 12:21:23 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:21:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: it wasn't because you liked me at all
[05/15/2004 12:21:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: now i understand
[05/15/2004 12:21:40 PM] xxhappycynicxx: that day I sort of snapped
[05/15/2004 12:21:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: the only reason you went out with me in the first place was because you knew i liked you
[05/15/2004 12:22:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: you weren't attracted to me at all
[05/15/2004 12:22:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: i used to be the same way
[05/15/2004 12:22:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I think I liked you as a person, but I thought I should like you because you liked me, and you were the first guy to ever like me
[05/15/2004 12:23:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: so everything we did together, was only because i guy had never liked you like that before, and you were blinded by how much i liked you
[05/15/2004 12:23:28 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I don't know
[05/15/2004 12:23:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's it
[05/15/2004 12:24:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: we had a lot in common, and i used to be the same way, there is just another thing we had in common
[05/15/2004 12:24:24 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what?
[05/15/2004 12:24:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am sorry for all the inappropriate things i did, had i known i would have stopped
[05/15/2004 12:25:09 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I think I was mainly curious and that's why I did stuff like that
[05/15/2004 12:25:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah, so was i
[05/15/2004 12:25:54 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, maybe we could just forget all that stuff
[05/15/2004 12:25:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, you don't have to talk to me again, i'll leave you alone, thank you for helping me understand
[05/15/2004 12:26:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i suppose so
[05/15/2004 12:26:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i don't think i can forget you
[05/15/2004 12:26:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: or the way you led me on
[05/15/2004 12:26:38 PM] xxhappycynicxx: led you on?
[05/15/2004 12:26:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's what it is called
[05/15/2004 12:27:08 PM] xxhappycynicxx: how exactly did I lead you on?
[05/15/2004 12:27:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: when you convince yourself, and the other person that you like them, and make it a lie
[05/15/2004 12:27:27 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, I didn't realize it was a lie, I was lying to myself
[05/15/2004 12:27:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: you just said you convinced yourself you liked me, at the same time you were lying to me
[05/15/2004 12:27:43 PM] xxhappycynicxx: and when I realized I was I ended it
[05/15/2004 12:28:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: well then i'm glad you did
[05/15/2004 12:28:12 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:28:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: i won't ask you to talk to me anymore
[05/15/2004 12:28:31 PM] xxhappycynicxx: is there anything else you'd want to say
[05/15/2004 12:28:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i really am sorry for being mean after you dumped me, you're a good person, i think you just don't know what you want, but who does these days
[05/15/2004 12:29:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: that is all
[05/15/2004 12:29:07 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:29:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: how about a real conversation
[05/15/2004 12:29:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: how about that party last night?
[05/15/2004 12:29:53 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:29:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: did i do alright with the sound?
[05/15/2004 12:30:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: i gave myself the fancy title "sound manager"
[05/15/2004 12:30:23 PM] xxhappycynicxx: when the microphone was on was the only time there was sound
[05/15/2004 12:30:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: there was music
[05/15/2004 12:31:11 PM] xxhappycynicxx: oh yeah
[05/15/2004 12:31:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: i had to make sure it didn't scream like it does when an idiot sets it up
[05/15/2004 12:31:27 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah, it sounded fine
[05/15/2004 12:31:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: like when it is to loud, the microphone picks up the speaker sound and sends that through the speaker and it becomes a cycle of noise
[05/15/2004 12:32:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: are you going to try out for section leader next year?
[05/15/2004 12:32:19 PM] xxhappycynicxx: no
[05/15/2004 12:32:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: how come?
[05/15/2004 12:32:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should
[05/15/2004 12:32:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: how about for your senior year?
[05/15/2004 12:32:40 PM] xxhappycynicxx: i wouldn't make a good section leader
[05/15/2004 12:32:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think you would
[05/15/2004 12:32:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: you're really good at flute
[05/15/2004 12:32:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I can't order people around
[05/15/2004 12:33:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh, yeah
[05/15/2004 12:33:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: are you going to sign my year book
[05/15/2004 12:33:31 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what would I write?
[05/15/2004 12:33:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't know
[05/15/2004 12:34:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: i was a good memory for your freshman year
[05/15/2004 12:34:05 PM] xxhappycynicxx: neither do I
[05/15/2004 12:34:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: sound good?
[05/15/2004 12:35:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: umm, I don't know
[05/15/2004 12:35:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: would you like me to sign yours?
[05/15/2004 12:35:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's what i would write
[05/15/2004 12:35:44 PM] xxhappycynicxx: a good memory for your freshman year?
[05/15/2004 12:35:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[05/15/2004 12:36:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: you were a great memory of all of my years
[05/15/2004 12:36:20 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:36:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'll never forget you
[05/15/2004 12:36:23 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:36:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: want me to sign it?
[05/15/2004 12:37:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I'm not sure
[05/15/2004 12:37:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is ok to be friends with an ex-boyfriend
[05/15/2004 12:37:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: seriously
[05/15/2004 12:37:40 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I know, but if the ex-boyfriend is going to still like you..
[05/15/2004 12:37:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: despite what your little friends tell you, you don't have to hate your ex-boyfriend, i won't be the last one that is for sure
[05/15/2004 12:38:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: so what if the ex-boyfriend still likes you
[05/15/2004 12:38:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: as long as he doesn't make a big deal about it
[05/15/2004 12:38:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i really don't think i am
[05/15/2004 12:38:42 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah as long as he doesn't interfer with other relationships
[05/15/2004 12:39:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just want to know why, it is another problem i have, sometimes needing to understand can be a good think, but in this case it isn't
[05/15/2004 12:39:33 PM] xxhappycynicxx: want to know why what?
[05/15/2004 12:39:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: you already answered why
[05/15/2004 12:39:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: the first question i asked you
[05/15/2004 12:39:56 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:40:08 PM] xxhappycynicxx: but you just said you wanted to know why
[05/15/2004 12:40:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'm sorry for interfering with you and eric, but don't you understand how much it hurt when you were sitting on his lap on the trip?  you did things with him that you didn't even do with me when we were going out
[05/15/2004 12:41:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you understand?
[05/15/2004 12:41:13 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:41:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: you see why i am hurt by that?
[05/15/2004 12:41:22 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what do you mean I did things with him I didn't do with you
[05/15/2004 12:41:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: like talk to him the whole lunch hour, and sit on his lap
[05/15/2004 12:41:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: and not lie to him
[05/15/2004 12:42:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what do you mean talk to him the whole lunch hour
[05/15/2004 12:42:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: we went to your spot and left me alone the whole lunch hour
[05/15/2004 12:42:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that is irrelevant, do you understand how you hurt my feelings?
[05/15/2004 12:42:54 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:42:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: and I did sit on your lap
[05/15/2004 12:43:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: at least i said sorry for hurting your feelings
[05/15/2004 12:43:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but you wouldn't have thought of doing that if we weren't going out
[05/15/2004 12:43:24 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I'm sorry for hurting your feelings
[05/15/2004 12:43:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: its a little more weird then talking to your ex-boyfriend wouldn't you agree?
[05/15/2004 12:43:50 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what?
[05/15/2004 12:44:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: sitting on your ex-boyfriends lap even though you're not going out
[05/15/2004 12:44:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: is a little more weird
[05/15/2004 12:44:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: that had to be the most hurtful thing you've done sit we broke up
[05/15/2004 12:44:31 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, I didn't sit on my ex-boyfriends lap
[05/15/2004 12:44:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know that isn't what i am saying
[05/15/2004 12:44:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: sorry, ex-boyfriends best friends lap
[05/15/2004 12:45:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: BrianJCullinan (12:44:14 PM): sitting on your ex-boyfriends lap even though you're not going out
[05/15/2004 12:45:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: right next to me
[05/15/2004 12:45:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: sorry brain fart
[05/15/2004 12:45:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: ex-boyfriends best friends lap
[05/15/2004 12:46:16 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, I needed a seat, I didn't want to be wedged between Erika and Evan's butt again
[05/15/2004 12:46:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh, yeah, sure
[05/15/2004 12:46:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: but as long as you're sorry for hurting my feelings, i will forgive you
[05/15/2004 12:47:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah, I'm sorry for hurting your feelings
[05/15/2004 12:47:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: go ahead, do what you want with eric, he made me a promise, and i know he won't break it
[05/15/2004 12:47:23 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I'm sorry for everything
[05/15/2004 12:47:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i do forgive you, and i'm not going to hold it against you anymore
[05/15/2004 12:47:53 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 12:48:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: and maybe someday, when you are ready, we can be friends
[05/15/2004 12:48:46 PM] xxhappycynicxx: when I'm ready?
[05/15/2004 12:49:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: just keep in mind what i said, despite what your friends tell you, it is ok to be friends with your ex-boyfriend, just look at your parents for example, they are still friends
[05/15/2004 12:49:52 PM] xxhappycynicxx: for their kids
[05/15/2004 12:50:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: when you are ready, when you are older, like next year, maybe you will understand how stupid it is to hate your ex-boyfriend
[05/15/2004 12:50:45 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I don't hate you
[05/15/2004 12:50:52 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I just don't want you to like me
[05/15/2004 12:50:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: why?
[05/15/2004 12:51:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: what do you mean by "like"
[05/15/2004 12:51:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: ?
[05/15/2004 12:51:19 PM] xxhappycynicxx: like still having feelings for me
[05/15/2004 12:51:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll always like you
[05/15/2004 12:51:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: sure i miss you, and the good times we had together, but i know it is over
[05/15/2004 12:52:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: so what do you mean by "like"
[05/15/2004 12:52:18 PM] xxhappycynicxx: nvm
[05/15/2004 12:52:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll always have feelings for you, you meant a lot to me, and still do, but i'm not going to let that interfere with you relationship between you and eric, or other people
[05/15/2004 12:54:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: my parents are divorced, but they still talk, my mom still thinks my dad is a good person, and sometimes my dad tells me some of the good things my mom did for him, just because my dad had a few problems, doesn't mean you can't be friends with him
[05/15/2004 12:54:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: just because i miss you doesn't mean we shouldn't be friends
[05/15/2004 12:54:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: you think i'm a good person right?
[05/15/2004 12:55:02 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:55:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i enjoy a good laugh
[05/15/2004 12:55:18 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what?
[05/15/2004 12:55:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm still the person you fell in love with, so why shouldn't we be friends
[05/15/2004 12:55:57 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, maybe I'm different
[05/15/2004 12:56:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh, you're very unique i agree
[05/15/2004 12:56:37 PM] xxhappycynicxx: but maybe I've changed since we broke up
[05/15/2004 12:56:42 PM] xxhappycynicxx: that was..3 months ago
[05/15/2004 12:56:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: but like i said, maybe when you are ready, this is an issue of maturity, not being different
[05/15/2004 12:56:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know, you're a lot more outgoing now i've noticed
[05/15/2004 12:57:14 PM] xxhappycynicxx: more outgoing?
[05/15/2004 12:57:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[05/15/2004 12:57:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: even if you have changed, is that the reason we shouldn't be friends?
[05/15/2004 12:58:14 PM] xxhappycynicxx: no
[05/15/2004 12:58:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: then why?
[05/15/2004 12:59:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: think of our past relationship as a learning experience
[05/15/2004 12:59:53 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, if you still have feelings for me it will make everything a little awkward
[05/15/2004 01:00:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's my problem
[05/15/2004 01:00:17 PM] xxhappycynicxx: your problem?
[05/15/2004 01:00:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm talking to you know aren't i?
[05/15/2004 01:00:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you feel awkward?
[05/15/2004 01:00:40 PM] xxhappycynicxx: sort of
[05/15/2004 01:00:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: just like you said, i'm still a good person, and you are a good person to
[05/15/2004 01:01:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: can't two good people talk to eachother?
[05/15/2004 01:01:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: can't two good people sign each others year books?
[05/15/2004 01:01:40 PM] xxhappycynicxx: it's just weid
[05/15/2004 01:01:43 PM] xxhappycynicxx: *weird
[05/15/2004 01:01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: because if two good people can't talk to each other, you should stop talking to eric
[05/15/2004 01:02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh,!
[05/15/2004 01:03:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: how about your mom, every time she sees me she says hello to me is a very posative way, the same way she did when we were going out
[05/15/2004 01:03:12 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, she didn't go out with you
[05/15/2004 01:03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i have been a little rude and not said much when she did
[05/15/2004 01:03:21 PM] xxhappycynicxx: and what was that think about eric?
[05/15/2004 01:03:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: nothing
[05/15/2004 01:03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: hes a good person
[05/15/2004 01:03:36 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 01:03:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if two good people can't talk then you shouldn't talk to him
[05/15/2004 01:04:08 PM] xxhappycynicxx: why would I not talk to him?
[05/15/2004 01:04:18 PM] xxhappycynicxx: there is no awkwardness
[05/15/2004 01:04:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: and there shouldn't be any here
[05/15/2004 01:04:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: talking to me
[05/15/2004 01:05:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: like i said before maybe it just takes a level of maturity you're not ready for
[05/15/2004 01:05:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: but eventually you'll understand
[05/15/2004 01:06:08 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what do you mean? To talk to my ex-boyfriend who still has feelings for me and nt find it awkward?
[05/15/2004 01:06:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: why do you keep bring up this "still has feelings for me" stuff
[05/15/2004 01:06:46 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, do you?
[05/15/2004 01:06:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: if i didn't have feelings for you, would you talk to me as a friend?
[05/15/2004 01:07:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: because we are both good people, and good people can't talk to each other?
[05/15/2004 01:07:10 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 01:07:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: then talk to me as a friend
[05/15/2004 01:08:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok?
[05/15/2004 01:08:36 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, I tell my friends stuff I don't think you could handle
[05/15/2004 01:08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: such as?
[05/15/2004 01:09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: so now you can't trust me?
[05/15/2004 01:09:24 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I didn't say I couldn't trust you
[05/15/2004 01:09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: then what can't i handle?  something about yourself?
[05/15/2004 01:09:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: me liking other guys?
[05/15/2004 01:10:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh, that comment didn't make very much sense
[05/15/2004 01:10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: you like other guys?  people i would know?
[05/15/2004 01:10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can tell me that, and i wouldn't mind
[05/15/2004 01:10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that is up to you
[05/15/2004 01:11:02 PM] xxhappycynicxx: one sec, let me think
[05/15/2004 01:11:27 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok, you said you wouldn't mind
[05/15/2004 01:11:34 PM] xxhappycynicxx: Eric
[05/15/2004 01:11:36 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I like ERic
[05/15/2004 01:11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: no i wouldn't mind
[05/15/2004 01:11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: is he the only guy you like?
[05/15/2004 01:11:54 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 01:11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: really?
[05/15/2004 01:12:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: really
[05/15/2004 01:12:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: i like a lot of people
[05/15/2004 01:12:11 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, I like just Eric
[05/15/2004 01:12:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: how come?
[05/15/2004 01:12:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know hes a good guy
[05/15/2004 01:12:31 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah
[05/15/2004 01:12:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: but how does he stand out?
[05/15/2004 01:13:02 PM] xxhappycynicxx: he's funny and nice and I never fight with him and I can tell him anything
[05/15/2004 01:13:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: I laugh, sounds like the same thing you used to say about me
[05/15/2004 01:13:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, if you did go out with him, i wouldn't mind, because i know he is a good guy and he would take care of you
[05/15/2004 01:14:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably better then i did
[05/15/2004 01:14:23 PM] xxhappycynicxx: you wouldn't mind?
[05/15/2004 01:14:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: definitely not
[05/15/2004 01:14:42 PM] xxhappycynicxx: really
[05/15/2004 01:14:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: because of you, i have reached another level of maturity and understanding
[05/15/2004 01:15:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: so thank you
[05/15/2004 01:15:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: for putting up with all my shit
[05/15/2004 01:15:09 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok, but then why do you make comments if he talks to me?
[05/15/2004 01:15:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it would be a lot easier for us to be friends if you had a boyfriends
[05/15/2004 01:15:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: i make comments because i didn't understand why you broke up with me, and we cleared that up today
[05/15/2004 01:15:57 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, it would be Eric
[05/15/2004 01:16:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: and since he is my best friend, i know you'd be happy with him, and that's all i ever want is to make you happy
[05/15/2004 01:17:06 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what about him?
[05/15/2004 01:17:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if you went out with him, weather i liked you or not would be irrelevant like it should be
[05/15/2004 01:17:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: what do you mean?
[05/15/2004 01:17:39 PM] xxhappycynicxx: you just said you knew I'd be hapoy, what about him?
[05/15/2004 01:17:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i know you'd be happy if you were with him
[05/15/2004 01:18:24 PM] xxhappycynicxx: yeah, but what about him?
[05/15/2004 01:18:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't understand what you're asking?
[05/15/2004 01:19:00 PM] xxhappycynicxx: well, you're saying you know I'd be happy, but not saying whether he'd be happy
[05/15/2004 01:19:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: ohhhhhhhhhhh
[05/15/2004 01:19:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: you worded it strangly
[05/15/2004 01:19:24 PM] xxhappycynicxx: oh
[05/15/2004 01:19:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: you are an incredible girl, i know that much for sure, and i know you would definitely make him happy, just like you did for me
[05/15/2004 01:20:09 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 01:20:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: but there is only one problem
[05/15/2004 01:20:17 PM] xxhappycynicxx: what?
[05/15/2004 01:20:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: hold on
[05/15/2004 01:22:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: when you and i first broke up, he made me a promise that he wouldn't do that, because dating your best friends ex-girlfriend is messed up.
[05/15/2004 01:22:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i know that even though he likes to joke around, he would never break a promise to me
[05/15/2004 01:22:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: sorry to ruin your plans
[05/15/2004 01:23:06 PM] xxhappycynicxx: omg
[05/15/2004 01:23:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: what?
[05/15/2004 01:23:22 PM] xxhappycynicxx: just the way you did that
[05/15/2004 01:23:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh great what did i do now?
[05/15/2004 01:23:56 PM] xxhappycynicxx: oh, yeah, I'm fine with you going out with him, do it, but oh, yeah, wait, he said he wouldn't do that, ha, sorry to ruin your plans
[05/15/2004 01:24:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, i meant what i said, it would be fine if you two went out
[05/15/2004 01:25:01 PM] xxhappycynicxx: but you don't really want us to
[05/15/2004 01:25:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, i don't think i would mind, since you explained why you broke up with me
[05/15/2004 01:25:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i know what i did wrong
[05/15/2004 01:26:01 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 01:26:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can let it go
[05/15/2004 01:26:04 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok
[05/15/2004 01:26:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: which means i have to ask him to take back his promise
[05/15/2004 01:26:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: to make you happy
[05/15/2004 01:26:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: just like i always wanted to do
[05/15/2004 01:29:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: [05/15/2004 01:28:58 PM] Efoehn: back to taking back the promise thing, why?
 [05/15/2004 01:29:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if you have feelings for her, more then just friends, i want you to go for it, because not holding you against going out with her, would make her happy, and that's all i ever wanted to do was to make her happy, and letting her be with you, would make her happy
[05/15/2004 01:29:43 PM] *** Auto-response from xxhappycynicxx: brb

BrianJCullinan: sorry i teased you a lot today
BrianJCullinan: i meant nothing by it
xxhappycynicxx: ok
xxhappycynicxx: but still
BrianJCullinan: what?
xxhappycynicxx: it's not nice
BrianJCullinan: sure it is, as long as you know i'm only joking
xxhappycynicxx: well, even so that's all you do
BrianJCullinan: all i do it teas you?
xxhappycynicxx: if I go over to you guys all you do is say I shouldn't be there or other things
BrianJCullinan: how naïve, i asked you about your study guides, and offered to help, and you responded with "are you in advanced" in a snotty tone, and i talked to you about try-outs, showed you my piece
BrianJCullinan: i wish you could see yourself, maybe someday you will look back on all of these disputes and see things the way i see them now
xxhappycynicxx: ok, first you said oh your study guides are so easy blah blah blah and said just wait til next year so I had to reply in some way and then the try-out things I said my music was harder than your's and you were going on about how it's so easy to play flute
BrianJCullinan: i wish you could see yourself from a juniors point of view, and i am definitely not the most mature person at times
xxhappycynicxx: see, that's what I don't like, why are you so condescending towards me
BrianJCullinan: my mother read an article that described the difficulty of selected instruments, and flute was one of the easiest ones to learn and trumpet was listed for advanced musicians
xxhappycynicxx: sure
xxhappycynicxx: right
BrianJCullinan: that's what she said
xxhappycynicxx: then why can I pick up a trumpet and play a scale and easy songs immediately but you can't even play a note well
BrianJCullinan: the article was written by professionals i'm not making it up
xxhappycynicxx: ok then
BrianJCullinan: you think you can do these things, and i told you how good you were because i was in love with you, but when we were going out i was blinded from that amongst many other things
xxhappycynicxx: ok, thanks, I suck and have many faults
xxhappycynicxx: I wouldn't say that flute's hard and go on like that except that you're so condescending
BrianJCullinan: condescending?
xxhappycynicxx: BrianJCullinan (5:41:01 PM): i wish you could see yourself from a juniors point of view
BrianJCullinan: and i meant what i said
BrianJCullinan: i understand
BrianJCullinan: but you don't
xxhappycynicxx: well, then why did you say 'condescending?'
BrianJCullinan: eventually you will understand my perspective
xxhappycynicxx: you know what, you're just a jerk and I have to go now, enjoy the rest of your evening

BrianJCullinan: i am not
BrianJCullinan: but you seem to think i am
xxhappycynicxx: well, condescending and telling me to go away and burn myself
xxhappycynicxx: not directly, but still
BrianJCullinan: i never told you that
xxhappycynicxx: the chemical thing
BrianJCullinan: what?
xxhappycynicxx: told me to put some chemical on my skin and that it would help it
BrianJCullinan: silver nitrate dyes your skin it doesn't hurt
BrianJCullinan: i'd never want you to hurt yourself
xxhappycynicxx: ok, well, opposite thing still
xxhappycynicxx: nvm
BrianJCullinan: lol, we have to many misunderstandings
BrianJCullinan: but you seem to take things i say in a very negative way
BrianJCullinan: i don't want that to happen
xxhappycynicxx: what about the condescendence?
BrianJCullinan: all i'm saying is there are some arguments we will have that you will someday look back on and realize they were very pointless
xxhappycynicxx: well, I know it's pointless but there's no reason for you to say I'm immature and that since you're older you get it when you're arguing about it too
BrianJCullinan: i only argue because i have a need to be understood
xxhappycynicxx: well so does everyone
BrianJCullinan: and you don't understand me and it drives me nuts
xxhappycynicxx: what don't I understand?
BrianJCullinan: many things
xxhappycynicxx: ok, like what?
BrianJCullinan: you don't understand my sarcasm for example
BrianJCullinan: you take me was to seriously and then you act like you hate me for it
xxhappycynicxx: I just don't think it's good to be all joking about stuff when you aren't on the best grounds with someone, do you?
BrianJCullinan: and i can't make it worse by not being any fun
xxhappycynicxx: well, you could joke but not in a mean way
BrianJCullinan: you know me, you should know when i am joking and when i am not, but for some reason you are incredibly negative towards me
xxhappycynicxx: I don't know you
BrianJCullinan: now who is the one that lied? and nearly cheated with his best friend had it gone on any longer?
BrianJCullinan: i believe that would be you
BrianJCullinan: i'm the one that should resent you
BrianJCullinan: not the other way around
BrianJCullinan: i have been nothing but incredibly sweet to you
xxhappycynicxx: I wouldn't have cheated on you
xxhappycynicxx: be realistic
BrianJCullinan: and you've treated me very poorly
xxhappycynicxx: ok, I'm sorry
xxhappycynicxx: but it just didn't seem like you liked me very muc
xxhappycynicxx: h
xxhappycynicxx: doesn't
BrianJCullinan: well i'm sorry if i haven't been nice
xxhappycynicxx: oh and you said I didn't get your sarcasm and that it wasn't meant to be mean, this is the definition of sarcasm

BrianJCullinan: you don't understand my humor
xxhappycynicxx: teasing
BrianJCullinan: sure
xxhappycynicxx: well, I don't mean to fight with you
BrianJCullinan: nor i with you
xxhappycynicxx: ok
BrianJCullinan: i don't want there to be tension between us, even though you lied to me and not seriously liking my best friend
xxhappycynicxx: I didn't lie
BrianJCullinan: don't you think that is worth something?
xxhappycynicxx: I didn't seriously like him then
BrianJCullinan: that despite the fact that i should be hurting because my best friend has something that attracts you that i didn't?
BrianJCullinan: wouldn't that show maturity?
xxhappycynicxx: what?
BrianJCullinan: that i should be hurting because my best friend has something that attracts you that i didn't?
xxhappycynicxx: it's not a complete sentence
BrianJCullinan: ok
xxhappycynicxx: well, I'm sorry
BrianJCullinan: and again i forgive you
xxhappycynicxx: ok
xxhappycynicxx: what are you forgiving me for?
BrianJCullinan: now please, just try not to take me so seriously, and don't treat me like i am a bad guy
xxhappycynicxx: ok
BrianJCullinan: for hating me
BrianJCullinan: and lying, and liking my best friend
xxhappycynicxx: ok, I didn't lie and I only hated you a little because you were a jerk
BrianJCullinan: why was i a jerk?
BrianJCullinan: we're going in circles now
xxhappycynicxx: you called me a bitch and were all grr don't talk to me stupid freshman

[16/06/2004 09:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: I know you don't want to talk to me but I really want everything to be good between us. I didn't lie to you, I never promised everything, I said what I felt at the time and feelings can change. How can you say I'm immature when I'm talking to you like this? There are many adults not as mature as me. I know what I want, my relationship with Eric is nothing like ours was, I just want to be with him. I'm sorry I made a mistake with you, I'm not even sure what the mistake was but I'm really sorry I hurt you.
[16/06/2004 09:58 PM] xxhappycynicxx: *anything not everything
[16/06/2004 10:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if you are not sure what mistake you made how can you learn from it?  if you don't learn from your mistakes how can any one be sure you won't make then again?  and if and when you make the same mistake again that will only enforce how immature you are

[16/06/2004 10:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: my mistake was dating you in the first place, i should not have jumped into things the way i did

[16/06/2004 10:04 PM] xxhappycynicxx: ok, at that time I didn't know what I wanted, I didn't mean to lead you on, I really thought I wanted to be with you but then you stopped talking to me and just touching me and I didn't like it and so I broke up with you, not because I fell for your best friend, but because I didn't want to go out with you. Afterwards I realized I liked Eric and looking back I saw that I had a slight crush on him which I always pushed away because I thought I was happy with you.
[16/06/2004 10:05 PM] xxhappycynicxx: why do you persist in saying how immature I am?
[16/06/2004 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: so why didn't you tell me all of this before you broke up with me, and i could have changed, and understood the way you felt

[08/11/2004 08:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[08/11/2004 08:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's a very good question
[08/11/2004 08:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: to distract the crowd?
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] Brianna: the male part
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: what do you mean?
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: the male cheerleader?
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] Brianna: no
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: what then did you mean?
[08/11/2004 08:04 PM] Brianna: they would be distracting the male part of the crowd
[08/11/2004 08:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] Brianna: unless the part of the male part is gay
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] Brianna: then they can watch the male cheerleader
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] Brianna: so I guess it all works out
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] Brianna: probably for lesbians too
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: but they distract everyone with their loudness
[08/11/2004 08:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[08/11/2004 08:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: and their peppyness
[08/11/2004 08:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: its very distracting to everyone
[08/11/2004 08:07 PM] Brianna: what's it supposed to distract them from?
[08/11/2004 08:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: the football game
[08/11/2004 08:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: so if they are losing they crowd won't notice how bad the team really is
[08/11/2004 08:09 PM] Brianna: oh
[08/11/2004 08:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: and our cheerleaders to distract the crowd as much as other school cheerleaders do because we win a lot
[08/11/2004 08:10 PM] Brianna: yeah, guess so
[08/11/2004 08:11 PM] Brianna: but the term cheerleader implies that they're supposed to lead the crowd in cheering on the team
[08/11/2004 08:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: well they try
[08/11/2004 08:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: just doesn't work
[08/11/2004 08:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: so they end up distracting us

[01/28/2005 11:15 PM] Brianna: what
[01/28/2005 11:17 PM] Brianna: it's not saying I got mail
[01/28/2005 11:21 PM] Brianna: I didn't get anything
[01/28/2005 11:22 PM] Brianna: so if you would resend it that would be nice
[01/28/2005 11:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: patience is a virtue
[01/28/2005 11:26 PM] Brianna: I was just worried my email didn't get it or something, I'm not being impatient
[01/28/2005 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: i c
[01/28/2005 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you appreciate the times i invite both you and Eric to the movies?
[01/28/2005 11:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: aren't i being mature enough to be considered "over" you
[01/28/2005 11:28 PM] Brianna: you made a big deal about the away message
[01/28/2005 11:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm just wondering because you keep bringing up the subject in your e-mail
[01/28/2005 11:28 PM] Brianna: I'm responding to what you say
[01/28/2005 11:28 PM] Brianna: you mention it, I mention it
[01/28/2005 11:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i am not considered "over" you even though i have to maturity to ignore, or not let your relationship bother me on most occasions
[01/28/2005 11:29 PM] Brianna: most occasions
[01/28/2005 11:29 PM] Brianna: most meaning not all so it does bother you at times
[01/28/2005 11:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: most occasions, you don't agree?
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] Brianna: what
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: it bothers me that you should share your private time activities with Eric, with anyone that could talk to you on instant message
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes that does bother me
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i can explain in more detail if you like?
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] Brianna: would it bother you if it was anyone else?
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: allow me to explain
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] Brianna: ok
[01/28/2005 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: i express my concern for Eric and his well being do i not?
[01/28/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes or no
[01/28/2005 11:33 PM] Brianna: I'm not sure what expressing your concern is
[01/28/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: when Eric has a problem, i show interest in trying to help him work it out for example
[01/28/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: would you agree?
[01/28/2005 11:34 PM] Brianna: well, I'm not involved in those discussions so I wouldn't know
[01/28/2005 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i believe it to be true
[01/28/2005 11:34 PM] Brianna: well, I guess I'm involved as the topic
[01/28/2005 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: therefore i shall continue
[01/28/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: my concern for Eric while reading that message was that i did not believe it is something appropriate to share with anyone
[01/28/2005 11:35 PM] Brianna: how is this your concern for Eric?
[01/28/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: my concern is this
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] Brianna: he was being immature?
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] Brianna: that's what you said before
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: that message was a sign on you sharing details of your intimacy with Eric for anyone to read
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] Brianna: he was there
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: good
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] Brianna: it wasn't like I was putting it up without him knowing
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: then he had something to do with it?
[01/28/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: did he know you had put it there?
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] Brianna: yeah
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] Brianna: he watched me
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: good, just enough reason for me to discuss it with Eric
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] Brianna: what exactly is your concern for him?
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] Brianna: that people will think bad of him or something?
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] Brianna: because soo many people have my sn?
[01/28/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes that's part of it
[01/28/2005 11:38 PM] Brianna: I really don't understand how you think people would think bad of him from that away message
[01/28/2005 11:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: i suppose that the other part is how i would relate myself to the situation, and that is, i would not want you share things about what went on during our relationship, and i don't see why Eric would want you to share such things either
[01/28/2005 11:39 PM] Brianna: Brian, did I share anything?
[01/28/2005 11:39 PM] Brianna: I didn't go off telling people details
[01/28/2005 11:39 PM] Brianna: that would be something you would do
[01/28/2005 11:39 PM] Brianna: and did do
[01/28/2005 11:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: but since Eric was aware that such a message was being displayed, then i suppose that is enough of a reason to confront him about it, not you
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and who did i share this with?
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: did i share details with people?
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you have an example?
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] Brianna: ummm, let's see, that mayor thing...Bradley and lots of other people
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] Brianna: and Eric knows everything we did
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] Brianna: yeah, you can't say you told know one
[01/28/2005 11:40 PM] Brianna: *no one
[01/28/2005 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: i also remember that night i apologized for my actions, bradley was the only one that knew something went of between us, i can't quite recall what exactly was said
[01/28/2005 11:41 PM] Brianna: do you remember any of that
[01/28/2005 11:41 PM] Brianna: Brian
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: however that is irrelevant, it was merely an example
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: you are contradicting yourself sooo bad
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh i am?
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: first you are like who did I tell, huh? then you say oh yeha
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: *yeah
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: I told people
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: but I apologized so it's ok
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i told bradly
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: something
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: yeah
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: and Jeffrey
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: and Eric
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't remember, it was an example
[01/28/2005 11:42 PM] Brianna: and probably tons of other people because Erika, Brandi, Derek, and Eric J knew
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: they knew what?
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you told Eric nothing of what happened?
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: it has never come up?
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] Brianna: it has
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you told him you would never tell?
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] Brianna: but you already told him everything and he wanted to see my side of it
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] Brianna: what
[01/28/2005 11:43 PM] Brianna: I never told him I'd never tell
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: and of course you told him that it was all my doing, you were the innocent little girl?
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] Brianna: what are you talking about
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] Brianna: no
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok, innocent big growd up gurl?
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] Brianna: will you shut up!
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] Brianna: you're such an asshole
[01/28/2005 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i apologize, that was out of line
[01/28/2005 11:45 PM] Brianna: saying you care about Eric's reputation because I said we were "doing stuff in bed"
[01/28/2005 11:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[01/28/2005 11:45 PM] Brianna: when you go off telling people in detail things you did with me
[01/28/2005 11:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: because i care about your reputation?
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: what
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: when we were going out
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: what are you getting at?
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: when we were going out you told people stuff we did
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i am one that is at fault for letting certain secrets slip
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: like telling Bradley and Jeffrey how you fingered me
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: and telling Andrea like everything about when we kissee
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: *kissed
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: OMG BRIAN
[01/28/2005 11:46 PM] Brianna: I HATE YOU 
[01/28/2005 11:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: but how can you prove that you would never do such thing, when you have already told Eric what you and I have done?
[01/28/2005 11:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: how can you prove that you wouldn't do that to Eric?
[01/28/2005 11:47 PM] Brianna: BRIAN
[01/28/2005 11:47 PM] Brianna: YOU TOLD ERIC EVERYTHING WE DID AND HE ASKED ME ABOUT IT AFTER WE HAD ALREADY BROKEN UP
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: how can you expect me to not get defensive, when you tell people you are doing stuff with Eric on your bed?
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] Brianna: you know what
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] Brianna: I can't talk to you 
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] Brianna: you are such an asshole
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh, i thought your capslock was broken
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] Brianna: you don't care about Eric at all
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: good thing its not
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] Brianna: all you care about is yourself
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: i care about my relationship with eric
[01/28/2005 11:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have a problem because i don't care about you at all
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] Brianna: oh, the relationship
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] Brianna: not him?
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: of course i care about him, that is what "relationship" implys
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: how could you care about a relationship if you don't care about the person it is between?
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: now you are just searching for things to argue with me about
[01/28/2005 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'm not going to do it anymore
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: Eric and i are going to college without you
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] Brianna: what the hell does that mean
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: you will both be better off
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] Brianna: what does that mean
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] Brianna: you are going to college without me
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: without you
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: exactly what i said
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: you won't be there
[01/28/2005 11:50 PM] Brianna: as in I'm not going?
[01/28/2005 11:51 PM] Brianna: ok, just seeing if you're going to try to force him to break up with me
[01/28/2005 11:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am not going to put any effort into it
[01/28/2005 11:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: so no, i am not going to "try"
[01/28/2005 11:52 PM] Brianna: well I'm not going to either because I see there is no point in trying to reason with you because you only believe what you want to believe and won't listen to anyone else and contradict yourself so much it's hard to even tell what you really think
[01/28/2005 11:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: I'm sorry for all the hurt I have caused you but the best thing to do would be to get over me being over you, it's been a long time, I know you may feel I shouldn't be offering you advice but you have offered it to me so I felt I should be able to return the favor.
[01/28/2005 11:54 PM] Brianna: I'll offer you advice
[01/28/2005 11:54 PM] Brianna: stop being an egotistical asshole
[01/28/2005 11:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh an here is some more
[01/28/2005 11:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll never let you get in the way of mine and Eric's friendship
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] Brianna: good for you
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: Eric is the only one that can make changed to that
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: not you
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: again
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: not you
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: without you
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: not you
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] Brianna: well I've sent him this whole conversation so he'll know what's going on
[01/28/2005 11:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: how is that for condescending?
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh i know
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: i sent it to him to
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] Brianna: I think you've got condescending down to an art form
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: i have no problem with him know why i argue with you
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: good example of your parents huh?
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: how ironic
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: hope this doesn't become a usual thing for you
[01/28/2005 11:56 PM] Brianna: what'
[01/28/2005 11:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: i always think about how i hope i don't turn out like my father, and i'm pretty far from him
[01/28/2005 11:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i don't have anything to worry about
[01/28/2005 11:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: you think i am egotistical
[01/28/2005 11:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: wait until you get all growd up and see people in the big world
[01/28/2005 11:58 PM] Brianna: yeah, and I have no clue what you're talking about with your dad and parents
[01/28/2005 11:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: *sigh*
[01/28/2005 11:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: read it over
[01/28/2005 11:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: should i type it again?
[01/28/2005 11:58 PM] Brianna: I just don't know why you typed that
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: good example of your parents, (you arguing with your previous boyfriend)
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: you followed their example nicely
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: grats to you
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] Brianna: what
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] Brianna: what about my parents?
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: just like you said in your e-mail
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: they argue with eachother
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: just like you argue with me
[01/28/2005 11:59 PM] Brianna: I never said that
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] BrianJCullinan: Or what if your  
 parents are constantly fighting or have communication problems? 
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] BrianJCullinan: you implied it
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] Brianna: no I didn't
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] Brianna: I was giving random examples
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] Brianna: do you think my dad beats my mom?
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] BrianJCullinan: And also, why should love be based off parents? Do  
 parents have perfect relationships? What about someone whose dad abused  
 their mom? Should they look at that for what love is? Or what if your  
 parents are constantly fighting or have communication problems? I don't  
 think love can be a copy of someone else's version but what the two people  
 involved make of it.
[01/29/2005 12:00 AM] BrianJCullinan: no
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] BrianJCullinan: do you think you should follow their example? because that is not what i suggested in my e-mail
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] Brianna: well I wasn't implying anything by it
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] BrianJCullinan: i suggested you should ask them for advice on love
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] Brianna: yeah
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] BrianJCullinan: not follow their example
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] BrianJCullinan: sorry, i thought you were just exaggerating the first part of that statement
[01/29/2005 12:01 AM] Brianna: well what advice can they give if their example is crappy?  And I'm not implying a damn thing
[01/29/2005 12:02 AM] BrianJCullinan: they still are much wiser than you
[01/29/2005 12:02 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i don't think you can accept that
[01/29/2005 12:02 AM] BrianJCullinan: because you keep arguing about it
[01/29/2005 12:02 AM] Brianna: I bet you think everyone's wiser than me
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: i bet i think that i am a very level minded person and you shouldn't make assumptions
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: i think you are a good writer
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: your well formed letter
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: couldn't have done better myself
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: i think you are smart
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: i think you, like the rest of us, have a lot to learn
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: but you aren't being very open for advise from anyone right now
[01/29/2005 12:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i hope, for your sake, that this is just a stage
[01/29/2005 12:04 AM] Brianna: I think you are a hypocritical condescending asshole
[01/29/2005 12:04 AM] Brianna: but what does that matter to you
[01/29/2005 12:04 AM] BrianJCullinan: oh of course
[01/29/2005 12:04 AM] BrianJCullinan: we are back to that
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: do you wonder why i don't prefer to talk to you?
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] Brianna: you're doing it
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: at least it isn't a bitter condescending asshole like last time
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] Brianna: and I'm not going to let you continue 
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: of course
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am wrong
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: always
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] BrianJCullinan: my bad
[01/29/2005 12:05 AM] Brianna: did I say you were wrong?
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] BrianJCullinan: by calling me a hypocritical condescending asshole
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah pretty much says it all
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] Brianna: what I think is you're just using this to throw what you think at me and I really don't care because I have no respect for you
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] Brianna: have a nice night does too
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] BrianJCullinan: no respect for me?
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] BrianJCullinan: what about have a nice night?
[01/29/2005 12:06 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am lost
[01/29/2005 12:07 AM] Brianna: any respect I once had has disappeared

[04/18/2005 10:46 PM] Brianna: oh
[04/18/2005 10:46 PM] Me: high definition has nearly the same precision as a computer monitor
[04/18/2005 10:46 PM] Brianna: oh
[04/18/2005 10:47 PM] Me: computer monitors are more precise then Tvs, for example, 1 pixel on a monitor might be the same as 2.5 pixels on a TV
[04/18/2005 10:47 PM] Brianna: ok
[04/18/2005 10:47 PM] Me: that's why words on a TV are always more blurred between pixels
[04/18/2005 10:47 PM] Brianna: oh
[04/18/2005 10:47 PM] Me: but high definition is such high quality
[04/18/2005 10:48 PM] Brianna: yeah

[06/28/2005 10:42 PM] Brianna: hi
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Me: hi
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Brianna: can I ask you a question?
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Me: sure
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Brianna: how do you really feel about me?
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Me: i feel nothing
[06/28/2005 10:43 PM] Me: i ignore you
[06/28/2005 10:44 PM] Brianna: do you wish I wasn't in Eric's life?
[06/28/2005 10:44 PM] Me: it is his life
[06/28/2005 10:44 PM] Me: he is a big boy, he can do when he likes
[06/28/2005 10:45 PM] Brianna: ok
[06/28/2005 10:45 PM] Brianna: just wondering if your feelings had changed
[06/28/2005 10:45 PM] Brianna: and I guess they have
[06/28/2005 10:45 PM] Me: i enjoy ignoring you
[06/28/2005 10:46 PM] Brianna: what does that mean?
[06/28/2005 10:50 PM] Me: it means i don't pay any attention to the excessive amount of time you spend together and how on various occasions he has turned down hanging out with me so that he could be with you doing god knows what.  It is just going to make it harder on him next year when we both go away to college next year, and i am not going to tolerate him staying in the dorm talking to you online all of the time.  he will be out doing stuff, meeting people, having fun, maybe even find another girl, and weather you like it or not he is not going to come to phoenix every weekend to see you despite the fact that he has a car
[06/28/2005 10:50 PM] Me: i'll let that settle in before i continue the next time you ask me what i think about you
[06/28/2005 10:50 PM] Brianna: what?
[06/28/2005 10:51 PM] Me: but i am not going to go any further then making sure Eric is happy
[06/28/2005 10:51 PM] Me: i will not interfere with your relationship, i will continue to ignore you
[06/28/2005 10:51 PM] Me: i know, i'm such a mean and terrible person and you hate me...
[06/28/2005 10:52 PM] Brianna: I'm just glad Erika no longer has to deal with you
[06/28/2005 10:53 PM] Me: well, that was her choice.  she doesn't know what she is missing because even though i love her to death as a person she has a bigger heart then yours, but she too is young and nieve
[06/28/2005 10:54 PM] Brianna: she's smart
[06/28/2005 10:54 PM] Me: you both are
[06/28/2005 10:54 PM] Me: she'll change her mind
[06/28/2005 10:54 PM] Me: but i won't be around when she does
[06/28/2005 10:55 PM] Brianna: she'll find someone better
[06/28/2005 10:55 PM] Me: we all will
[06/28/2005 10:56 PM] Me: how would you feel is she started dating Eric after you
[06/28/2005 10:56 PM] Me: she wants to go to NAU
[06/28/2005 10:56 PM] Me: anything can happen
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Brianna: how do you think Eric feels about your plans?
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Me: i don't have any plans?
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Brianna: what
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Me: i told you i would interfere
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Me: i don't have any plans
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Me: do you? you going to ruin your chance at a Scholarship to George Town or another Honors program to follow Eric to NAU?
[06/28/2005 10:57 PM] Brianna: " i am not going to tolerate him staying in the dorm talking to you online all of the time.  he will be out doing stuff, meeting people, having fun, maybe even find another girl, and weather you like it or not he is not going to come to phoenix every weekend to see you despite the fact that he has a car"
[06/28/2005 10:58 PM] Brianna: those plans
[06/28/2005 10:58 PM] Me: that's not plans, that's the way it will be
[06/28/2005 10:58 PM] Brianna: so you don't want a friend
[06/28/2005 10:58 PM] Brianna: you want a puppet
[06/28/2005 10:59 PM] Me: a puppet?  am i using Eric for my benefit?  how is his happiness benefiting me?  he is not a form of entertainment and neither is your pathetic relationship
[06/28/2005 10:59 PM] Brianna: you think that's what he wants?
[06/28/2005 10:59 PM] Me: do not engage an enemy without first knowing their motives
[06/28/2005 10:59 PM] Brianna: to never see or talk to me again?
[06/28/2005 11:00 PM] Me: yes he wants to be happy
[06/28/2005 11:00 PM] Brianna: to meet tons of people and get another girlfriend?
[06/28/2005 11:00 PM] Me: anything can happen
[06/28/2005 11:00 PM] Me: its up to him
[06/28/2005 11:00 PM] Me: but you're not going to be there to stand in his way
[06/28/2005 11:01 PM] Brianna: what are you going to do to me?
[06/28/2005 11:01 PM] Me: ignore you
[06/28/2005 11:01 PM] Me: leave you here in phoenix
[06/28/2005 11:01 PM] Brianna: you think he will?
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Me: you going to move to flagstaff?
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Brianna: so that's it right, out of sight out of mind?
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Me: i like that but no
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Brianna: then what?
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Me: maybe for me
[06/28/2005 11:02 PM] Me: not for Eric
[06/28/2005 11:03 PM] Me: he will do what he wants
[06/28/2005 11:03 PM] Brianna: what will that include do you think?
[06/28/2005 11:03 PM] Me: i don't know, but what i said before sounds pretty reasonable
[06/28/2005 11:03 PM] Brianna: why do you think he'll listen to you?
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: i'll be there to help him
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: i'll help him make friends
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: get involved
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: have fun
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: be happy
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: all positive things
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Brianna: you think that's what he wants?
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: yes
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Brianna: to meet new people and leave me behind?
[06/28/2005 11:04 PM] Me: i'm sure he will come back to visit
[06/28/2005 11:05 PM] Brianna: and what of your plans?
[06/28/2005 11:05 PM] Me: but unless he wants to sleep in the car he won't be back every weekend
[06/28/2005 11:05 PM] Me: all i can do is be there for him
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Me: now what of your plans?
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Brianna: my plans?
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Me: you really think you will be able to stand being alone for weeks on end?
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Brianna: I have no plans besides trusting Eric
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Me: you're not going to get bored?
[06/28/2005 11:06 PM] Brianna: what do you mean?
[06/28/2005 11:07 PM] Brianna: are you saying I'll cheat on him?
[06/28/2005 11:07 PM] Me: you fell in love with him before you were finished with me, what makes you think it won't happen again?
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Brianna: I didn't do that
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Me: you admitted to it
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Brianna: you can think whatever you want though
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Brianna: I know nothing can change your mind
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] Me: you didn't answer the question
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] Brianna: what question?
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] Brianna: and why should I answer any of your questions
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] Brianna: it won't change anything
[06/28/2005 11:10 PM] Me: you fell in love with him before you were finished with me, what makes you think it won't happen again?
[06/28/2005 11:10 PM] Brianna: I didn't
[06/28/2005 11:10 PM] Me: what makes you think you won't find someone else?
[06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Brianna: what makes you think I will?
[06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Me: you didn't answer the question
[06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Brianna: I don't think I'll meet someone knew
[06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Brianna: there is no one else
[06/28/2005 11:12 PM] Me: i think that you will because after you left me, what happened?  you found someone else
[06/28/2005 11:12 PM] Brianna: well I'm sorry
[06/28/2005 11:12 PM] Me: sorry about what?

[06/28/2005 11:13 PM] Me: i'm not
[06/28/2005 11:13 PM] Brianna: well you're trying to ruin my happiness
[06/28/2005 11:13 PM] Me: you should be sorry that you have already made up your mind about you life and don't leave any room for opportunity
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Me: or improvement for that matter
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Brianna: what?
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Me: well you have already decided that you will be with Eric forever
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Me: and he has decided the same thing
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Brianna: what do you want us to decide?
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Brianna: that you'll break us up?
[06/28/2005 11:14 PM] Brianna: I know you'll try as hard as you can
[06/28/2005 11:15 PM] Me: but sometimes thing don't always work out like we plan.  I didn't plan to get dumped by you 3 days before valentines day, but i knew it was going to happen eventually

[06/28/2005 11:15 PM] Me: no, i won't try to break you up, i will ignore you

[06/28/2005 11:15 PM] Me: that's a completely different subject
[06/28/2005 11:16 PM] Brianna: well it's true
[06/28/2005 11:16 PM] Me: no i'm going to try to get him to meet people and make friends and be involved and not stay in the dorm all the time
[06/28/2005 11:16 PM] Me: no i mean our relationship is a completely different topic
[06/28/2005 11:16 PM] Me: [06/28/2005 11:15 PM] Brianna: well I couldn't takie your possessiveness anymore
[06/28/2005 11:17 PM] Me: we can talk about that if you like

[06/28/2005 11:18 PM] Me: its not going to make life any better
[06/28/2005 11:18 PM] Me: now you say "How would you know anything, you're just my stupid ex-boyfriend"
[06/28/2005 11:18 PM] Me: well i have an answer for that too
[06/28/2005 11:18 PM] Me: because i used to be just like you
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Brianna: and how am I like?
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Me: [06/28/2005 11:17 PM] Me: but go ahead and block yourselves off from all possibilities
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Me: that's what you are doing
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Me: you both are
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Brianna: so what do you think we should do?
[06/28/2005 11:19 PM] Brianna: meet as many people as possible?
[06/28/2005 11:21 PM] Me: i think you should stop worrying about what i think of you, or what my plans are for next year and spend more time redefining your relationship
[06/28/2005 11:23 PM] Me: are you two really perfect for each other?  why don't you just admit to yourselves that anything is possible.
[06/28/2005 11:23 PM] Brianna: anything is possible
[06/28/2005 11:24 PM] Brianna: I just wish you weren't so eager to see our relationship fail
[06/28/2005 11:24 PM] Me: you can say that now, but you still don't believe it
[06/28/2005 11:24 PM] Me: i am not eager to see it fail, like i said, i ignore you
[06/28/2005 11:24 PM] Me: and will continue doing so after this conversation
[06/28/2005 11:24 PM] Brianna: by ignoring me and trying to influence Eric you want to see it fail
[06/28/2005 11:25 PM] Me: the ways i have listed "influencing" Eric cannot cause a relationship to fail
[06/28/2005 11:25 PM] Me: you are afraid
[06/28/2005 11:25 PM] Me: but i am glad you are talking to me about it
[06/28/2005 11:25 PM] Brianna: by preventing him to talk to me or visit me
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Brianna: that makes a relationship fail
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Me: oh no, preventing him from visiting you is not going to be inflicted by me
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Me: lol
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Brianna: what does that mean?
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Me: i wouldn't even try that one, you're missing the 3rd element here
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Me: your parents
[06/28/2005 11:26 PM] Me: you're still a minor
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: lol
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Brianna: you think your plans are foolproff
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Brianna: *proof
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: lol
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: nah
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: anything can happen
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: i don't have any plans
[06/28/2005 11:28 PM] Brianna: I don't want to talk to you anymore
[06/28/2005 11:28 PM] Me: i don't blame you
[06/28/2005 11:28 PM] Me: you will work it out on your own
[06/28/2005 11:28 PM] Me: you don't need to talk to me anymore
