To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside-down, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C. 
  
 the Russians used a pencil. Your taxes are due again--enjoy paying them.
