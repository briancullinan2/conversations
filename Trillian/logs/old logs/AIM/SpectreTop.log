[02/20/2006 06:24 PM] Me: who is this?
[02/20/2006 06:25 PM] Me: i finished the stupid CS homework

[02/20/2006 08:17 PM] SpectreTop: Yeah sorry about that this is forrest. For the Negative Class can you just take the Multiply class and set one of the sides to always be -1?
[02/20/2006 08:17 PM] Me: i set it to 0
[02/20/2006 08:17 PM] Me: but yes, only use the left side
[02/20/2006 08:20 PM] SpectreTop: why would you set it to be 0 if you wanted it to be a negative number
[02/20/2006 08:26 PM] Me: no
[02/20/2006 08:26 PM] Me: i'll just send you mine
[02/20/2006 08:26 PM] SpectreTop: uh ok
[02/20/2006 08:26 PM] Me: i guess that would work
[02/20/2006 08:26 PM] Me: actually i see what you are doing
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] Me: that's probably a better way to do it
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] Me: set left to the value and right to -1 and multiple left by right
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] Me: i get it
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] SpectreTop: yeah
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] Me: i'm copying that
[02/20/2006 08:27 PM] SpectreTop: how would I set right to always = -1 ?
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] SpectreTop: would I do that right below the super?
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] Me: let me change mine and i'll send it
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] Me: no right in super
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] SpectreTop: ok
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] Me: super (lhs, Num(-1) )
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] SpectreTop: oh ok
[02/20/2006 08:28 PM] SpectreTop: I see
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] Me: no because then you have weird toString stuff to do
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] Me: use this way
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] SpectreTop: why?
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] SpectreTop: how does that make toString strange?
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] Me: well i guess it doesn't matter
[02/20/2006 08:29 PM] SpectreTop: send me your way and then I will try both and see which I like better
[02/20/2006 08:34 PM] Me:      1  //================================================

      4  public class Negative extends BinaryOp 
      5  { 
      6    public Negative( Term lhs ) 
      7    { 
      8      super( lhs, new Num(-1) ); 
      9    }

     20  }
[02/20/2006 08:59 PM] SpectreTop: in the end does Negative even need to be an extension of Binary Op? 
[02/20/2006 09:00 PM] Me: not really
[02/20/2006 09:00 PM] Me: but do it anyways
[02/20/2006 09:00 PM] SpectreTop: why?
[02/20/2006 09:01 PM] SpectreTop: couldnt it just be a term since it only has stuff on one side, the -1 is defined within the class?
[02/20/2006 09:02 PM] Me: yeah i guess
[02/20/2006 09:02 PM] Me: how do you spell your last name
[02/20/2006 09:02 PM] SpectreTop: I think I might try that

[02/20/2006 09:15 PM] Forest Schwyn: ahh I see
[02/20/2006 09:16 PM] Forest Schwyn: so it should be so for negative should it be something similar to return "(- " + number.toPrefixString() + ")"; depending on how I wrote my class?

[02/22/2006 12:01 AM] Me: both yes

[02/22/2006 12:02 AM] Forest Schwyn: what does he mean what method?
[02/22/2006 12:03 AM] Forest Schwyn: does he want something other than the definition?
[02/22/2006 12:07 AM] Forest Schwyn: and the answer to #2 is java.lang.Object correct?
[02/22/2006 12:08 AM] Me: i just gave the definition
[02/22/2006 12:08 AM] Me: is it?
[02/22/2006 12:09 AM] Forest Schwyn: i didnt know exactly what he wanted for questions 3 and 4, I did find the defintions though

[02/22/2006 12:09 PM] Forest Schwyn: someone redid all the levels available in the shareware doom, in the Doom 3 engine
[02/22/2006 12:09 PM] Forest Schwyn: its pretty cool acutally
[02/22/2006 12:09 PM] Me: holy crap that would be amazing
[02/22/2006 12:09 PM] Me: the shareware is the entire first episode

[02/22/2006 12:10 PM] Forest Schwyn: I havnt had doom 3 installed in a very long time so the last time I played the mod was at like .2 alpha which was just he first level but it was still really cool
[02/22/2006 12:11 PM] Me: cool i will have to check it out
[02/22/2006 12:11 PM] Me: i'd like to see some screen shots
[02/22/2006 12:14 PM] Forest Schwyn: tehey did spice it up a little but it plays the same
[02/22/2006 12:17 PM] Forest Schwyn: I know the first episode pretty well
[02/22/2006 12:18 PM] Me: i hope they do all the episodes, the levels get pretty complex
[02/22/2006 12:18 PM] Me: there are missing monsters
[02/22/2006 12:18 PM] Forest Schwyn: they were a little unsure about that
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Me: like the boss at the end of doom3 is similar to the bost of episode 2
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Me: *boss
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Me: i wonder what the boss of resurection of eveil is
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Forest Schwyn: yeah only cyber knights were way more of a bitch in doom 2 than doom 3
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Me: i have both doom3 and the extension and don't even play either
[02/22/2006 12:19 PM] Me: omfg dude
[02/22/2006 12:20 PM] Me: what i made all the original quakes in quake 4
[02/22/2006 12:20 PM] Forest Schwyn: I found Doom 3 to be kind of boring and repetative
[02/22/2006 12:20 PM] Forest Schwyn: part of the reason they are unsure about the next 3 episodes is becuase they thought there might be legal issues
