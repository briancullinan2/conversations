[04/05/2005 04:42 PM] *** Auto-response sent to shake it ok: "It sounds like someone dangerous wrote this, and this buttoned-down psychotic could probably snap at any moment and stalk from office to office with an Armalite AR-180 Carbine gas-operated semiautomatic.  He's probably at home every 
night with a little rattail file, filing a cross into the tip of every 
one of his bullets.  This way, when he pumps a round into ... *someone* 
... it will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dum 
dum flowers inside you to blow a load of guts out through *someone's* 
spine.  This is probably somebody you've know for years."
