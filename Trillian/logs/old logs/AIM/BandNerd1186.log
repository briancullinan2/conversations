BandNerd1186: Question for you
BandNerd1186: While at the funeral of her own mother, a girl met this guy whom she did not know. She thought this guy was amazing, so  much her dream guy she believed him to be, that she fell in love with him there but never asked for his number and could not find him. A few days later the girl killed her own sister.
BandNerd1186: Question: What is her motive in killing her sister?
BrianJCullinan: i don't know
BrianJCullinan: whats the answer?
BandNerd1186: answer: She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again.    If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was a test by a famous American psychologist used to test if one has the same mentality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in this test and answered it correctly. If you didn't answer correctly - good for you.
BrianJCullinan: lol sweet
BandNerd1186: well I take it that you liked that
BrianJCullinan: yup
BandNerd1186: :) thats good
BandNerd1186: I just hope that you got the answer wrong
BrianJCullinan: i did
BandNerd1186: Well I am going to go now and take the shower that I said that I was going to take
BandNerd1186: I will talk to you later
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: bye
BrianJCullinan: luv u!
BandNerd1186: that reminds me of what you wrote in my yearbook
BrianJCullinan: wut?
BandNerd1186: The third entry that you did in my yearbook
BrianJCullinan: i can't remember
BandNerd1186: Well I hope that you have a goodnight
BandNerd1186: and I Love you too
BandNerd1186: :)
BandNerd1186: Bye

LittlePNutss: uh huh
BandNerd1186: I know that we have been down this road tons of times, but are you just my friend because you really want to be my friend, or are you just doing it because you feel that you have to be my friend.  I don't care what you say, I just want the truth

BandNerd1186: I know that it was a stupid question
BandNerd1186: but I just feel that we really are not friends, we are just acting around each other
LittlePNutss: your friendship means a lot to me
BandNerd1186: I just feel that this is all just a lie

LittlePNutss: trust your heart
BandNerd1186: that is what I am doing and my heart is telling me that something is not right in my life
LittlePNutss: what makes you think that something not right is our friendship?
BandNerd1186: I don't know, I just feel really different when I am around you now
LittlePNutss: i see
LittlePNutss: maybe everything is too right?
BandNerd1186: I just feel that my whole life is falling right in front of my eyes
LittlePNutss: maybe nothing is wrong at all and thats whats different
BandNerd1186: I don't know I just feel like I am just about to break down right now
