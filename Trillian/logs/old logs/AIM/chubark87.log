[11/10/2005 08:50 PM] Dustin White: something that lead me to elaborate
[11/10/2005 08:50 PM] Dustin White: and i said if i told a girl how much i liked her from the heart and she told me to dream on and it would never happen it would hurt
[11/10/2005 08:51 PM] Dustin White: and then i said i didnt know the guy and i appologize if he deserved it
