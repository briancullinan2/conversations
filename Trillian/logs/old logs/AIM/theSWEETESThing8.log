theSWEETESThing8: ahh
theSWEETESThing8: everytime i say it i get butterflies
BrianJCullinan: funny how life work sometimes; deeply missing something you loathe so much
BrianJCullinan: i get chills and coils of thoughts of leaving
BrianJCullinan: i don't want to go
theSWEETESThing8: i konw....i toally know wut u mean....like...with me and preston...i hate him but everytime i see him...i dont know...something comes over me
theSWEETESThing8: and i wish it would have been different
BrianJCullinan: but i am going to have to say goodbye to everyone sooner then later, and i don't like the thought of never seeing anyone i have know for 4 years
theSWEETESThing8: i know....and ....im VERY optimistic...and im like o well be friends forever...but in reality we we really  how many people will i be friends with in 10 years
theSWEETESThing8: like its so weird that all the juniors will be gone in a year...
theSWEETESThing8: its so sad

theSWEETESThing8: ok n e ways...i cant talk about that...
theSWEETESThing8: wuts new?
theSWEETESThing8: lol
theSWEETESThing8: o did i tell u about the note for cale?
BrianJCullinan: it is times like these that encourage me to confess my feelings for someone.  all the laughs and all the troubles will all be gone someday, and that day i will want to go back, but i won't be able to;  and then there will be a greater sorry then ever imaginable
BrianJCullinan: i need to write another story
theSWEETESThing8: i know....i was just talkin about this to marissa...u can never go back...but in the moment i feel like it will last forever and i have my whole life to decide wut to do 
BrianJCullinan: i never did let you read it
theSWEETESThing8: i know!!! that would be a great stoty
theSWEETESThing8: ya i know
theSWEETESThing8: so did i tell u about my note to cale? its not interesting...but i love talkin about cale
theSWEETESThing8: lol
BrianJCullinan: She lay down against my body on the ground with her head to my heart.  I saw her dress rest against my dying body as I left; she was so beautiful
theSWEETESThing8: wut  ur dead? when did this happen?
BrianJCullinan: you will see
theSWEETESThing8: alright
theSWEETESThing8: ok now im thinking...and that can never be good...
BrianJCullinan: ooo this is a good one
BrianJCullinan: I was watching her from a distance at school where she usually hangs out with her friends.  She noticed me and smiled just like she always does; she is so beautiful.  Just then the guy she desired, the guy I had to compete with, appeared in front of her.  Was I dreaming?  She wrapped her arms around him and looked towards me.  I instantly felt the rejection; I wanted to kill that guy she was holding now.  Her hair lightly swayed in the wind and the guy disappeared.  She turned towards me, still slightly smiling, and mouthed the words "thank you".  Then I shed a single tear, felt it roll down the side of my cheek and drip off my chin.  It glimmered and fell to the ground with a crash, just like my heart, and I walked away.  My thoughts went blank and I slept the rest of the way through the night.
theSWEETESThing8: i read that part
theSWEETESThing8: remember and i asked u if u really cried
BrianJCullinan: yeah that one is sad
BrianJCullinan: i really did
BrianJCullinan: its hard to admit it
theSWEETESThing8: cried?

theSWEETESThing8: o how sad...i cry over...blah....ya nvm
BrianJCullinan: tell me about this note
theSWEETESThing8: its hard bein a teenager in love...well not love but u know wut i mean
BrianJCullinan: yeah

theSWEETESThing8: and i asked him today if he ever got it and he said no and that he was gunna read it at home
theSWEETESThing8: and he read it on the bus and britt said he thought it was cute
theSWEETESThing8: :)

BrianJCullinan: brittany is a bitch
theSWEETESThing8: im sorry u feel that way but shes one of my best friends
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry you feel that way but shes one of my mortal enemies

BrianJCullinan: because
BrianJCullinan: i like a girl i never had a chance with, how pathetic is that?
theSWEETESThing8: because...
BrianJCullinan: but i'm gonna try anyways
theSWEETESThing8: well i like about a million and one guys a day
theSWEETESThing8: and i never have a chance with n e of them
BrianJCullinan: but your a girl!!! girls don't ask guys out, its always the guy that has to ask the girl
BrianJCullinan: its the nature of humans
theSWEETESThing8: i havent talked to my friend in about 4 months and i asked wut was  new and she has had 2 bfs and a lot of action and she asked me and i told her and shes like wow i feel like i didnt miss n e thing
BrianJCullinan: so all you can do it wait
theSWEETESThing8: then why arent n e guys askin me out?
BrianJCullinan: and when some one comes along you don't like you reject them, it happens to me, and thats the biggest fear for a guy is being rejected
BrianJCullinan: all you can do it talk to you male friends like me and find out what to do until then, and wut to say to a guy you don't like, so you don't like hurt them for life
theSWEETESThing8: ya but the worst thing is not being asked ever
theSWEETESThing8: but do i ever?

theSWEETESThing8: u know why
theSWEETESThing8: cuz guys...most guys...are shallow
theSWEETESThing8: thats why
theSWEETESThing8: and THAT my friend IS pathetic
BrianJCullinan: then u have to wait
BrianJCullinan: theres lots of people
BrianJCullinan: high school is a hard age
BrianJCullinan: girls are shallow too
theSWEETESThing8: ya cuz like i said guys are shallow 
theSWEETESThing8: ya we are but not in the same way
BrianJCullinan: everyone says i'm really nice, but no one comes to me either
theSWEETESThing8: like i like guys who dont have good bodies...or arent cute in the least...but if theyre sweet and stuff i like them
theSWEETESThing8: and guys dont approach a girl and get to know her unless theyre "hot" and have a 
 tite ass"
BrianJCullinan: but theres a chance that one time i might happen to meet one that i like, and she might like me back, and then we might go out, but until then i just have to keep looking and so should you
BrianJCullinan: brb
theSWEETESThing8: k
BrianJCullinan: back
theSWEETESThing8: k
theSWEETESThing8: in responce to wut u wrote...i hate having to wait and "keep lookin"

BrianJCullinan: i c
BrianJCullinan: well i plan to tell this girl i like her
BrianJCullinan: and i don't know what she will say
theSWEETESThing8: ya its a bad habit
BrianJCullinan: i will probably never hook up with her anyways
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to make up a secret language now
theSWEETESThing8: ...i dont know...maybe u should tell her that u think shes pretty and want to hang out with her sometime...
theSWEETESThing8: a secret language for wut?
BrianJCullinan: i know thats wasw i was going to tell her
theSWEETESThing8: o
BrianJCullinan: should i say pretty or beautiful?
