Session Start (AIM - bjcullinan:xtreammetallica): Fri Jul 19 08:39:08 2002
BJCullinan: good day
xtreammetallica: Goodmorning Brian
BJCullinan: yeah until i started talking to my dad online
xtreammetallica: what do you mean
BJCullinan: i was trying to tell him that sometimes i am nice to my brothers and not always mean but no matter what i say i am always a jerk
xtreammetallica: aww....IM sorry
BJCullinan: i mean i turned off their game earlier because they wouldn't shut up and i was trying to sleep
BJCullinan: but since they didn't bust in my room and jack my dvd player i felt i should make up for it and take it out to them just as they were going to leave for grande canyon is when i woke up again
xtreammetallica: maybe you should just asked them to turn down the volume
BJCullinan: it wasn't the volume
BJCullinan: they wouldn't shut up
BJCullinan: and every morning it is the same thing they are to loud
xtreammetallica: oh it was them
xtreammetallica: why dot you tell them not to....and why dont they listen
BJCullinan: because i have told them not to and they are forgetful i guess
BJCullinan: maybe they won't forget next time that brian will turn off the game if they are not quiet
xtreammetallica: im sorry
xtreammetallica: maybe
BJCullinan: i am just going to stop talking to him
BJCullinan: then how about the time hunter was making andrews airplanes with that special paper, i told him you shouldn't do that andrew might get mad, why don't you wait til andrew gets home so you can ask him before you make any more
BJCullinan: andrew gets home and hunter explains what i said obviously in a crude way because andrew gets all steamed up at me and says you have no right to tell him he can't ruin my planes
BJCullinan: so no one appriciates the few nice things i do maybe i should just live up to what i am called every day
