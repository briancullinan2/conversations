[02/13/2006 09:40 PM] Laurel Crothers: and also projects that help you learn and develop skills
[02/13/2006 09:40 PM] Me: and we should even do normal research like finding solutions to stuff that's not completely common but could cause bigger problems
[02/13/2006 09:40 PM] Me: like my bios research earlier
[02/13/2006 09:41 PM] Laurel Crothers: totally
[02/13/2006 09:41 PM] Laurel Crothers: exactly
[02/13/2006 09:41 PM] Me: i'll come up with a standard system to document all the information
[02/13/2006 09:41 PM] Laurel Crothers: we have one
[02/13/2006 09:42 PM] Me: ok
[02/13/2006 09:42 PM] Laurel Crothers: but we may need to evaluate it
[02/13/2006 09:42 PM] Me: well let me know what it is later and i will reformat my discoveries so far accordingly
[02/13/2006 09:42 PM] Laurel Crothers: ok thanks
[02/13/2006 09:43 PM] Me: as long as it is similar to M$ error solutions it should work fine
[02/13/2006 09:43 PM] Laurel Crothers: yeah
[02/13/2006 09:43 PM] Laurel Crothers: if not we'll change
[02/13/2006 09:43 PM] Laurel Crothers: change and evaluation to be better and more efficient... is a good thing

[03/02/2006 02:54 PM] Laurel Crothers: sorry
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Me: after 3 days of a transaction pending they drop the transaction completely until the merchant finally submits it then it shows up under posted transactions, well thanks to the 3 day weekend because of monday being a holiday for everyone else in the US except NAU none of the merchants turned in the transactions so they all dropped and showed up again and i went under and got an over draft fee
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Laurel Crothers: WOW
[03/02/2006 02:56 PM] Laurel Crothers: oh no
[03/02/2006 02:59 PM] Me: so after 3 days of making a purchase they assume that you didn't make it and drop the transaction pending from the available amount and now a whole bunch of transactions showed up

[03/27/2006 10:15 AM] Laurel Crothers: very impressive
[03/27/2006 10:16 AM] Laurel Crothers: if i wanted to this for my music
[03/27/2006 10:16 AM] Laurel Crothers: what would it take.... how secure and legal is it
[03/27/2006 10:17 AM] Me: well the apache server can be password protected, i bet you could even log in with an SQL server, PHP is very easy to handle SQL, and i would just give you the website on a CD
[03/27/2006 10:17 AM] Laurel Crothers: legal?
[03/27/2006 10:17 AM] Me: it is only streaming and for your personal use, i don't think there should be an legal issues
[03/27/2006 10:17 AM] Laurel Crothers: and the apache portion
[03/27/2006 10:17 AM] Me: the person can't actually download copies of anything, unless they get every individual song out of the cache
[03/27/2006 10:18 AM] Me: apache is free and legal
[03/27/2006 10:19 AM] Laurel Crothers: lol ok.... but explain to me what i'd need ot do
[03/27/2006 10:20 AM] Me: well just set up apache, there is an msi file and setup is pretty simple, i have done lots of fancy stuff with security and virtual hosts that i can show you how to do
[03/27/2006 10:20 AM] Laurel Crothers: ok
[03/27/2006 10:20 AM] Me: then there is the PHP setup
[03/27/2006 10:20 AM] Me: but that's pretty simple too
[03/27/2006 10:20 AM] Laurel Crothers: lol

[03/27/2006 10:25 AM] Laurel Crothers: but i'm very interested
[03/27/2006 10:26 AM] Me: well i can certainly show you the type of stuff it will install at work today

[03/30/2006 11:26 AM] Laurel Crothers: haha not yet
[03/30/2006 11:38 AM] Me: i think you should so i can listen to your stuff

[03/30/2006 11:39 AM] Me: i am going to come in early today
[03/30/2006 11:39 AM] Laurel Crothers: k
[03/30/2006 11:39 AM] Me: i am very stressed and the office is a pleasant working environment
[03/30/2006 11:39 AM] Laurel Crothers: why are you stressed
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Me: i failed a chem test today, i have a lab i didn't get very much done on, i have math homework due tomorrow, my girlfriend is stressed also about a scholarship she has to send an application in by tomorrow, i spend to much money and can't find the time to work on a budget, i have to schedule classes for next semester and haven't even made a schedule yet, any day my hard drive could die on me like the first one did, and i haven't gotten another one to RAID 1 them
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Me: is that a valid reason to be stressed?
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Me: how about you? how is work?
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: yeah those are valid reasons
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: but managable
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: i'm fine
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: 1) when is the lab due
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: what chem class?
[03/30/2006 11:42 AM] Laurel Crothers: What math?
[03/30/2006 11:43 AM] Laurel Crothers: bring your homework into work and we'll work on it
[03/30/2006 11:44 AM] Me: lab is due next friday so i have time, chem 151 i love the class but the parts of the test i did worst on i got good grades on the quizzes, pre-calc 3rd time taking it and i have a C, i can do all of the online homework in my head, but i can't get a good freaking grade on the tests
[03/30/2006 11:44 AM] Laurel Crothers: well its your luck i was a math major for a year and a half and have a minor in chemistry
[03/30/2006 11:44 AM] Laurel Crothers: ;)
[03/30/2006 11:44 AM] Laurel Crothers: you jsut need to break it all down
[03/30/2006 11:44 AM] Laurel Crothers: and figure out what needs to done when
[03/30/2006 11:45 AM] Laurel Crothers: its a lot... but you can manage if you make a plan
[03/30/2006 11:45 AM] Me: lol yeah i need to relax, otherwise it will just get worse
[03/30/2006 11:46 AM] Me: i feel bad for my girlfriend though, she lost her letter of recommendation for the scholarship, and she was about to cry from all the stress, she has everything else prepared and just needed the letter, now she has to get it to prescott by tomorrow at 5, i told her i could drive her if she needed but that didn't help
[03/30/2006 11:46 AM] Laurel Crothers: yeah
[03/30/2006 11:46 AM] Laurel Crothers: she'll find the letter
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Me: she might have one, the teacher is going to rewrite it, i guess i just worry to much
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Me: *too
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Laurel Crothers: yeah you do
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Laurel Crothers: let it go
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Laurel Crothers: worry is an unhealthy emotion
[03/30/2006 11:47 AM] Laurel Crothers: and does no good

[03/31/2006 10:33 AM] Laurel Crothers: lol
[03/31/2006 10:33 AM] Me: this doesn't make any sense
[03/31/2006 10:33 AM] Me: A forest ranger is watching the progress of a forest fire spreading towards her from the top of a 3855-foot mesa. In 4 minutes, the angle of depression to the leading edge of the fire changes from 10.91 degrees to 12.11 degrees.
[03/31/2006 10:34 AM] Me: is the mesa 3855 feet wide?
[03/31/2006 10:34 AM] Me: it high?
[03/31/2006 10:34 AM] Me: is she on top of the mesa? or is the fire coming from the top of the mesa?
[03/31/2006 10:34 AM] Me: these are the things i need to know
[03/31/2006 10:34 AM] Laurel Crothers: shes on the mesa
[03/31/2006 10:35 AM] Me: ok so is the fire going towards the mesa?
[03/31/2006 10:35 AM] Laurel Crothers: yes
[03/31/2006 10:35 AM] Me: wouldn't the angle be bigger and then small because its coming towards her?
[03/31/2006 10:36 AM] Laurel Crothers: no the sides of the angle are the mesa wall and the ground and the line of sight to the fire
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Me: so first the line of site she has to look out further so the angle is bigger because it says its coming towards her
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Me: so the fire is futher away from the wall
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Me: then the edge comes closer so the angle is smaller
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Laurel Crothers: right
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Me: from he rline of sight
[03/31/2006 10:37 AM] Me: but it says from 10 degrees to 12 degrees
[03/31/2006 10:38 AM] Laurel Crothers: no clue unless i see it
[03/31/2006 10:43 AM] Me: that's swell it didn't work
[03/31/2006 10:51 AM] Me: wow this one makes more sense but i still got it wrong
