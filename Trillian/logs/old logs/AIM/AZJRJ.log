AZJRJ: i was wondering if u could make me a program
AZJRJ: for AIM
BrianJCullinan: what do you want it to do?
AZJRJ: something like this
AZJRJ: where all u have to do is type it and it changes the colors for u
AZJRJ: and it alternates for u
BrianJCullinan: oh like a fader?
BrianJCullinan: the color of the text you mean?
AZJRJ: ya.....but not fading colors
AZJRJ: just alternating them
BrianJCullinan: i c
BrianJCullinan: uhhhhh i
BrianJCullinan: would have to think about it
AZJRJ: okay
BrianJCullinan: heres what i can do
BrianJCullinan: not in aim but in a seperate window i can make it change the colors of what ever you type
BrianJCullinan: in this seperate window you can select the order of the colors
AZJRJ: so u cant make a program?
AZJRJ: oh
AZJRJ: then copy and paste it into aim?
BrianJCullinan: the text will automatically be copied so all you would have to do is paste it in the window
AZJRJ: oh
BrianJCullinan: it would automatically copy
AZJRJ: so all i would have to so is ctrl+v?
BrianJCullinan: BUT! i may be able to make it automatically in aim
AZJRJ: wo0o that be nice
BrianJCullinan: i would have to look at it but it is possible
AZJRJ: cause i dont want a fader but just something that can alternate 2 or more colors
BrianJCullinan: yeah i c
BrianJCullinan: but i am very busy with another program right now
AZJRJ: and if u wanna put the extra time into it ...... could u possbly add a CaPs ThInG LiKe ThIs.......or.......big and little letters?
BrianJCullinan: yeah
AZJRJ: im paying big bucks for this program ...... i expect to have it tomorrow!!
BrianJCullinan: and another thing i can do it subscript and superscript
AZJRJ: LoL .... weLL whenever u can make it would be apperciated
AZJRJ: whats sub and superscript?
BrianJCullinan: it is above and below the line
BrianJCullinan: like in chemestry
AZJRJ: ooooooh
BrianJCullinan: little numbers above and little numbers below
AZJRJ: so its wavy >8D
BrianJCullinan: could create a wave effect
AZJRJ: right?
BrianJCullinan: could be
AZJRJ: o0o0oo0o0o
BrianJCullinan: or alternating

BrianJCullinan: Non Windows users are still going to be stuck with no wheels on their mices. The workaround necessitates using the native code for intercepting the mouse events Java just doesn't normally receive. I can only suggest someone try developing a similar shared library for their OS using the supplied header file as a template.Please saved the attached file, it is a fix for the mouse wheel bug.

 Or follow the preceeding link to view more information about fixing a mouse wheel

AZJRJ: What was thought to be a human body part found at a sewage plant in Kingman last month turns out not to be after all. 
 
 It appeared to be a male organ. But the Mohave County medical examiner says it's latex or plastic and probably is a novelty shop item. 
 
 Last month's discovery at the Hilltop Wastewater Treatment Facility in Kingman prompted a sheriff's office investigation and a flood of media attention. 
AZJRJ: heard it on news....was compelled to find it online
AZJRJ: glad its not by phoenix :-D

BrianJCullinan: ok
*** Auto-response from AZJRJ: wc3 

BrianJCullinan: i can help
BrianJCullinan: veiwing the HTML page, find the link that you want to change.  it should start with <A HREF="" then so on
BrianJCullinan: after the HREF="<some page"
 type TARGET="_blank"
 Before the closing  >
BrianJCullinan: other commands include   "_Parent" which opens it in the parent window, only applies if using frames, and "_top" which opens in the whole window, and "_self" which opens in the same frame that contains the link
BrianJCullinan: also, if you want all the links to open the same way by default, there is another command set RIGHT BEFORE the '</Head>';  type <BASE TARGET=""> then one of the commands discussed above

AZJRJ: other people have it worse then you o.O
BrianJCullinan: i wasn't even going fast, i we barely accelerating like 20 and then i was thinking lets go the speed limit, and then i saw her, and then i looked at that damn construction on the ground and then finally started breaking and i knew i was going to stop because i have no front and everyone has to stop quickly every once in a while and then i just stop when i heard the screech and thought it was some stupid kid and then they hit me
AZJRJ: yes
AZJRJ: it took me a while to realize we got hit
AZJRJ: didn't register because it's never happened before, even though i felt it
AZJRJ: oh well it's over
BrianJCullinan: so maybe if they'd stop with the fucking construction things would go a little smoother, i mean they tear up our school, it takes forever to get out, people hate waiting and speed all the time
AZJRJ: even though you could have prevented it, it still happened and you didn't get blamed for it
AZJRJ: it's over, not that big of deal :-\

AZJRJ: but the person behind you actually made the "fatal mistake"
BrianJCullinan: if i left more distance and didn't have to break so fast, the guy behind me would have never hit me
AZJRJ: true
BrianJCullinan: it wasn't my fault in the eyes of the law, but it really was my fault
AZJRJ: but his excuse was he skidded
AZJRJ: if he had as much room as he said
AZJRJ: and was going 30 if that fast, then he shouldn't have hit you
BrianJCullinan: all that matters to them is i stopped and then he hit me forward, but if i didn't suck at driving none of this would have happened
AZJRJ: you don't suck at driving
AZJRJ: i just say you drive too slow
AZJRJ: not your actual ability
AZJRJ: even i space out sometimes
AZJRJ: and not pay attention
BrianJCullinan: it's not even that, i am to easily distracted, i could blame it on my past ADD, but i think i've gotten over that, i just get distracted easily, and all the stress, and construction was enough of a distraction
AZJRJ: oh
AZJRJ: :-\
AZJRJ: i agree there are a lot of distractions
BrianJCullinan: and life was so good too
AZJRJ: well all i can say is if you don't feel like driving for whatever reason, i could drive
AZJRJ: or have somebody else drive 
AZJRJ: drving "imparred" is bad
AZJRJ: gosh damn, everything i'm saying is probably making it worse
AZJRJ: i should shut up, i'll ttyl bye
BrianJCullinan: i know but i was so happy, i took brianna out a lot last weekend, i was going to talk to mike and carl about computer stuff and get money from that, my job didn't suck that bad yestarday
AZJRJ: i really hate talking to people like this and make them feel better, i can't do it
AZJRJ: sorry
BrianJCullinan: no its not making it worse
BrianJCullinan: at least your talking to me
BrianJCullinan: thats an improvement

BrianJCullinan: what you want?
AZJRJ: you wouldn't happen to have a avi to vcd converter program would you?

BrianJCullinan: sorry don't have one
AZJRJ: damn
BrianJCullinan: sorry i don't have anything to convert video
BrianJCullinan: windows media player used to be able to play and convert real audio and quick time audio but microsoft had to dissable that when both of those went commercial
AZJRJ: oh well, i can't burn kill bill then
AZJRJ: because i need to go from avi to vcd then i can burn it on a regular cd-r cd (i think)
BrianJCullinan: well if you get even the trial version of quick time you should be able to burn avi
AZJRJ: hm?
AZJRJ: of what program?
AZJRJ: well the  Cucusoft AVI to VCD/DVD software demo you can only convert 1 minute 
BrianJCullinan: yeah but avi is a quick time format isn't it?
AZJRJ: quick time?
AZJRJ: is that the mac form of windows media?
BrianJCullinan: macintosh quick time
AZJRJ: (Link: http://www.avi-vcd.com/avi-to-vcd.asp)http://www.avi-vcd.com/avi-to-vcd.asp

[04/21/2004 18:39:59] BrianJCullinan: because there are 135 different characters, and with a length of 3-16 that's 13, so 135 to the power of 13 is

 PHOENIX - Authorities believe excessive speed may have played a role in a Saturday morning car crash that killed a woman and injured two men, police said.
 
 Ingrid Hohl, 26, was killed in the 11:38 a.m. crash near Tatum Boulevard and Betty Elyse Lane, police said. Hohl was a passenger in a car driven by Brian Hohl, 26, who suffered serious head injuries. Investigators believe Seth Resler, 17, may have lost control of his car and crossed into oncoming traffic. Resler was hospitalized in stable condition.

[02/01/2005 11:39 AM] BrianJCullinan: i want to talk to you a little bit about this lock in party
[02/01/2005 11:39 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i would like you to be open minded
[02/01/2005 11:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: i agree with your stand point on why you would not like any video games to be played accept DDR
[02/01/2005 11:40 AM] BrianJCullinan: maybe because you don't want people to just go off and do their own thing, you want people to enjoy the time together
[02/01/2005 11:41 AM] BrianJCullinan: i understand that, however i believe that to completely exclude other video games is very narrow minded
[02/01/2005 11:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: you said that you didn't want x-box or playstaystion because people can't play those games.  i think that is extremely untrue and irrelevant
[02/01/2005 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: people can still have a great time even if they are just learning to play games, i personally do not have an x-box but everytime Kristin has a Halo party, i enjoy it
[02/01/2005 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: maybe i will just write an essay about it
[02/01/2005 11:44 AM] BrianJCullinan: not everyone wants to sing kareoke and watch you play DDR, that is not fun too me or many other people
[02/01/2005 11:44 AM] BrianJCullinan: however playing consol games, let alone computer games are quite enjoyable

[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: i said no halo
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: y not?
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: ps2 and xbox are fine
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: it's not school appropriate
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: well maybe
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: need to talk to parents about it
[02/01/2005 03:00 PM] Jeffrey: and put it on permission slip
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is not not school appropriate
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] Jeffrey: but for now, no
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] Jeffrey: it's rated M isn't it?
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: t
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: teen
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] Jeffrey: really?
[02/01/2005 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i think
[02/01/2005 03:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: so is quake 3
[02/01/2005 03:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: what about permission slips?
[02/01/2005 03:02 PM] Jeffrey: but no computers
[02/01/2005 03:02 PM] Jeffrey: they need to be made
[02/01/2005 03:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: since some parents don't let their kids play video games at all
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: just say like some games may be rated M for Mature
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: or T for Teen
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] Jeffrey: ok
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: just like pg13 movies
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: same difference
[02/01/2005 03:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: but now about the computers
[02/01/2005 03:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you put LAN party on the sheet of activities you automatically have 20 people signed up, i can promise you that
[02/01/2005 03:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: Me

[02/01/2005 03:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: all of those people would be interested in a LAN party
[02/01/2005 03:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: and would be disappointed without one
[02/01/2005 03:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: Greg M too
[02/01/2005 03:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: nvm i don't know his last name
[02/01/2005 03:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: the saxaphone greg
[02/01/2005 03:11 PM] Jeffrey: oh
[02/01/2005 03:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: and 10 of those 16 people could supply the computers
[02/01/2005 03:13 PM] Jeffrey: ok
[02/01/2005 03:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: if kids get permission slips then no one will have to worry about what the games being played are
[02/01/2005 03:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am just trying to help come up with ideas, i am not trying to like make or break the party
[02/01/2005 03:15 PM] Jeffrey: but i still do not want computers
[02/01/2005 03:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is your decision on what activities will be available, but i think you would get a bigger response from people that want to participate if you offer more stuff than DDR and Karaoke
[02/01/2005 03:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you are worried about where the computers will go, or if they will make noise, all of those things can be adjusted
[02/01/2005 03:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: people can use head phones
[02/01/2005 03:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe some of the time we show a game like DDR or computer game or XboX being played on the over head with music in the background
[02/01/2005 03:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: and most of the time it will just be music and visualizations
[02/01/2005 03:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: it would be awesome to show DDR on the overhead
[02/01/2005 03:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: i g2g
[02/01/2005 03:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: ttyl
[02/01/2005 03:19 PM] Jeffrey: cya
[02/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: 1 more thing, in your next announcement tell people that if they want music to be played they have to bring it to me ahead of time and tell me what tracks so i can make a playlist ahead of time
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can always adjust the playlist
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: ok
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it would be helpful
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: especially you and your techno
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: yeah
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: we should play lots of techno
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i will need some of it ahead of time
[02/01/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: ok

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Jeffrey): Wed Feb 02 14:10:12 2005
[02/02/2005 02:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you are worried about people being excluded because they don't already know how to play computer games, well here is an argument for you!  how many people have play your beloved Dance Dance Revolution at a time?  the answer is 2, everyone else have to sit around and watch.  well i plan on allowing up to 10 people play computer games, and most likely 8 to 16 people playing xbox.  what do you think or that?
[02/02/2005 02:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: and those people are going to be playing rated M games, so they can do it with or without administration, or your consent.  they will probably be playing halo, that is no more difficult then any other game, but it is much more enjoyable than DDR.
[02/02/2005 02:15 PM] Jeffrey: ok, i found out
[02/02/2005 02:15 PM] Jeffrey: we need to approve all video games and movies
[02/02/2005 02:15 PM] Jeffrey: so, bring your argument up to administration about games
[02/02/2005 02:15 PM] Jeffrey: computers are too hard
[02/02/2005 02:16 PM] Jeffrey: ok?
[02/02/2005 02:16 PM] Jeffrey: are you going to have everybody bring their monitors
[02/02/2005 02:16 PM] Jeffrey: speakers
[02/02/2005 02:16 PM] Jeffrey: tower
[02/02/2005 02:17 PM] Jeffrey: power strip
[02/02/2005 02:17 PM] Jeffrey: keyboard
[02/02/2005 02:17 PM] Jeffrey: mouse
[02/02/2005 02:17 PM] Jeffrey: ?
[02/02/2005 03:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[02/02/2005 03:24 PM] Jeffrey: ?
[02/02/2005 03:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: [02/02/2005 02:16 PM] Jeffrey: are you going to have everybody bring their monitors
[02/02/2005 03:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[02/02/2005 03:25 PM] Jeffrey: ok, how will you get 10 computers working off of 1 outlet?
[02/02/2005 03:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think there is more than one outlet in the band room
[02/02/2005 03:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: and who is it "too hard" for?
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] Jeffrey: i need a list of all 10 people who said they are willing to bring in their computers
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] Jeffrey: then i will personally ask them if they are willing to bring in everything they need
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: 10 computers not necessarily 10 people
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] Jeffrey: and let other's use their computers
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] Jeffrey: even when they are not there monitoring
[02/02/2005 03:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: when they aren't then i will
[02/02/2005 03:28 PM] Jeffrey: you told me 10 people
[02/02/2005 03:28 PM] Jeffrey: i would like 10 names
[02/02/2005 03:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: i meant 10 computers
[02/02/2005 03:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: but more than that will want to play computer games
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] Jeffrey: that is why console is much easier
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can have that too
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] Jeffrey: TVs can check out from ITC
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: wonderful
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] Jeffrey: 4 people can play some games
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] Jeffrey: only need a system and different video games
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok even more than 4 people can play
[02/02/2005 03:29 PM] Jeffrey: whatever
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can have up to 16 people on both platstation and xbox each
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: i am talking generally
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: i need to go to the dentist
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: good go
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: but the computers are a nice thought, but how practical are they?
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: need to think more literally
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: very
[02/02/2005 03:30 PM] Jeffrey: no, it's more want than need
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: they are very practical
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] Jeffrey: and computer is 1 person
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: this entire party is about want
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: dumbass
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: this is about what jeffrey wants
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: not what the band wants
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and that needs to change now
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] Jeffrey: excuse me
[02/02/2005 03:31 PM] Jeffrey: if you want to make changes, host your own damn lock in
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am sick of you being so pessimistic
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] Jeffrey: it's not even that
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] Jeffrey: so don't give me this bullshit
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is exactly that
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] Jeffrey: i'm sorry but now no computers
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can't make that decision if you expect people to come
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you need to leave these options open
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] Jeffrey: it's NOT PRACTICLE
[02/02/2005 03:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: says who?
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] Jeffrey: yes, it can be done
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it will
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] Jeffrey: but i think it will involve too much work
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: from you?
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] Jeffrey: no
[02/02/2005 03:33 PM] Jeffrey: everybody who participates
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am offering to put worth all the effort needed to do it, including arguing with you about it, it is not going to affect you either way so why the hell are you worried so much about it?
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: 10 people
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: 10 different computers
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: finding space
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: outlets
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: cords
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: bringing everything in
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you don't want to play then don't
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: that will take a maximum of 30 minutes
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: before the party starts
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's all i ask
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you don't have to even worry about it
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: i need to go
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] Jeffrey: goodbye
[02/02/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: bye
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: if you want your computer
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: i want a list of who is bringing in computers
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: and everything they need to run it on
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: including their own power strips
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's fine
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: also what games you were thinking about
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: you need not worry yourself
[02/02/2005 03:40 PM] Jeffrey: then i will ask them personally
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] Jeffrey: any fps games will not pass
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: i will personally print off permission slips if i have too
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] Jeffrey: since it all needs to be approved by administration
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: and kristin has agreed to bring in her xboxes and hole
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: *halo
[02/02/2005 03:41 PM] Jeffrey: and pitching a shooting game will not work
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: we will see
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] Jeffrey: then, i want you to go to ITC to see if it is even practicle to set up a LAN party
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] Jeffrey: in the band room
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can do it without using the school network
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] Jeffrey: no internet?
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] Jeffrey: all offline?
[02/02/2005 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[02/02/2005 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: i already planned on talking to Kilgore though thanks
[02/02/2005 03:43 PM] Jeffrey: give me the list of your 10 people

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Jeffrey): Wed Feb 02 19:59:14 2005
[02/02/2005 07:59 PM] Jeffrey: hi
[02/02/2005 07:59 PM] *** Auto-response sent to Jeffrey: I am currently away from the computer.
[02/02/2005 07:59 PM] Jeffrey: so what computer games are you thinking of playing anyways?
[02/02/2005 08:00 PM] Jeffrey: because i do not think any shooter game on any system will be appropriate
[02/02/2005 08:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably not
[02/02/2005 08:58 PM] Jeffrey: what games?
[02/02/2005 08:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: sry i just got home
[02/02/2005 08:58 PM] Jeffrey: i am still against the idea
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: all we need is permission slips
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: then the office can't complain
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] Jeffrey: but
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you are against it then don't put any extra thought or effort into it
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: i will take care of everything
[02/02/2005 08:59 PM] Jeffrey: if not everybody consents
[02/02/2005 09:00 PM] Jeffrey: it is still out in the open where people can see, and be offended by
[02/02/2005 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i understand
[02/02/2005 09:00 PM] Jeffrey: can't subject them to that, and there is no place to put 10 computers in a tiny room
[02/02/2005 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: if not everyone consents, or permission forms are not turned in, i will contact them to varify and if still negative results then it will be a no go
[02/02/2005 09:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: did you check your mail?
[02/02/2005 09:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: e-mail?
[02/02/2005 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmm?
[02/02/2005 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: i sent you a picture
[02/02/2005 09:04 PM] Jeffrey: ok
[02/02/2005 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think it is pretty
[02/02/2005 09:04 PM] Jeffrey: i rarely check it
[02/02/2005 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: well when you do you will see the picture of where i thought would be a good idea to place things
[02/02/2005 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not trying to set anything in stone
[02/02/2005 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: this is a suggestion, your the one that has to decide where everything goes
[02/02/2005 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i thought it would be a good idea to have a plan already made up before the party
[02/02/2005 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: this should be a good start
[02/02/2005 09:06 PM] Jeffrey: well, obviously
[02/02/2005 09:06 PM] Jeffrey: but um, you do realize we do not get the chorus room until after 8?
[02/02/2005 09:06 PM] Jeffrey: or even 9
[02/02/2005 09:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: what is the problem with that?
[02/02/2005 09:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: if we have the movie in there that will be easy to set up
[02/02/2005 09:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: and people can enjoy the band room as a general meeting and socializing area with music and visualizations in the background
[02/02/2005 09:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: i thought maybe later in the evening we could hook up the DDR or a video game for a few minutes to the projector and turn of the lights and do some fog and stuff
[02/02/2005 09:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if the movie is in the band room it might prevent some of that
[02/02/2005 09:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: people are already used to being in the band room, i don't think they are going to want to be quite during a movie there
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: ok, we will have to do some planning with what goes where
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: but take into acount of food
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: and hopefully 50 people
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: 10 computers takes up space
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: did you see my pictures?
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: checking, parents keep giving me talks
[02/02/2005 09:10 PM] Jeffrey: it is pissing me off

[02/21/2005 12:37 PM] Jeffrey: what CDs are best for burning MP3s onto
[02/21/2005 12:37 PM] Jeffrey: and they actually work 
[02/21/2005 12:37 PM] Jeffrey: because i have uh CD RW
[02/21/2005 12:37 PM] Jeffrey: burned MP3s on it... and it doesn't work in my car
[02/21/2005 12:38 PM] Jeffrey: i haven't tried it elsewhere, but it is making me sad
[02/21/2005 12:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's because your car can't play mp3s
[02/21/2005 12:39 PM] Jeffrey: why not?
[02/21/2005 12:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: only radios that can play mp3 can play them
[02/21/2005 12:39 PM] Jeffrey: that makes me sad!
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can burn regular music files
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: just have windows media player do it
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] Jeffrey: so there is no way for me to burn MP3s onto a CD and have my car be able to play it?
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have to make an audio cd
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can't play mp3 files on the cd, but you can burn them as audio files
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: then it will work in yur ca'
[02/21/2005 12:40 PM] Jeffrey: =(

[02/21/2005 12:41 PM] Jeffrey: please?

[02/21/2005 12:41 PM] Jeffrey: how!? i fucked up twice already
[02/21/2005 12:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: just don't burn the music as mp3

[02/21/2005 12:41 PM] Jeffrey: i have stupid acoustica MP3 burner

[02/21/2005 12:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can still listen to the mp3 songs you have, you just have to burn them differently
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: make windows media player do it
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: select the mp3s you want
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: then right click
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: and select "Send to"
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: then select your burner drive
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: then open it up and of the left it will say "burn these files now"
[02/21/2005 12:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: go through the wizard and make sure you select "burn these files as audio"
[02/21/2005 12:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: then it will transfer it to windows media player and that will do it for you
[02/21/2005 12:44 PM] Jeffrey: ok aswome
[02/21/2005 12:44 PM] Jeffrey: let me try it now... 
[02/21/2005 12:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: then it will burn them as audio even though you can't put as many on one cd

[02/28/2005 07:33 PM] Jeffrey: you are going to be playing the music?
[02/28/2005 07:33 PM] Jeffrey: well obviously
[02/28/2005 07:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[02/28/2005 07:33 PM] Jeffrey: if we got you a projector, could you project the little visual color things from wmp on the wall?
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes that's what i was hoping on doing
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: oh cool
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: now can you get 2?
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: because we need pretty lights
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: one for music and one for movies?
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: i was hoping to get at least 3 or 4 projectors
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: and 1 or 2 for video games
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and where is the music and movies going to be?
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: just project it onto a wall in the practice room
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] Jeffrey: we need to start planning that
[02/28/2005 07:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but you could just as easily use a TV?
[02/28/2005 07:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes we need to plan because i have to be able to figure out exactly which cords to bring, and then we can fill in the missing supplies from the ITC if they let us take cords and stuff too
[02/28/2005 07:35 PM] Jeffrey: um, the ITC only has 1 tv
[02/28/2005 07:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can't bring Tvs?
[02/28/2005 07:35 PM] Jeffrey: then there is that big screen you have to go through zelinski to get
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] Jeffrey: we could i guess
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just don't think we should get more than to projectors
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: to much liability
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: stupid kids might break them
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] Jeffrey: i want the big screen TV!
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: if they are playing video games/ horsing around
[02/28/2005 07:36 PM] Jeffrey: i was thinking, how could they break it?
[02/28/2005 07:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: well the "band" one is almost broken
[02/28/2005 07:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: the colors don't show up right
[02/28/2005 07:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: and the light bulbs are really sensitive because of how hot they get and they are expensive to replace
[02/28/2005 07:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: like $20 each
[02/28/2005 07:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: more than your double reed
[02/28/2005 07:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: :-P
[02/28/2005 07:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if they break it we won't be able to get a replacement bulb that night

  "I have an amazing talent: I know almost every song that has ever existed." 
  The rich man laughs. 
  The poor man says, "I am willing to bet you all the money you have in your wallet that I can sing a genuine song with a lady's name of your choice in it." 
  The rich man laughs again and says, "Ok how about my daughters name, Joanna Armstrong-Miller." 
  The rich man goes home poor. The poor man goes home rich.

[03/07/2005 10:12 PM] WG Wise Master: why?
[03/07/2005 10:12 PM] AZJRJ: you can't hook up a ps2 directly to a projector can you?
[03/07/2005 10:12 PM] WG Wise Master: i was thinking we could switch off using the project for music and game
[03/07/2005 10:12 PM] WG Wise Master: and yes you can hook them up directly
[03/07/2005 10:12 PM] AZJRJ: do the projectors have sound?

[03/07/2005 10:13 PM] WG Wise Master: we aren't even going to have more systems than that because of that stupid rule
[03/07/2005 10:13 PM] AZJRJ: what rule?

[03/07/2005 10:15 PM] AZJRJ: there wouldn;t be an issue if it were accepted
[03/07/2005 10:15 PM] WG Wise Master: we are already getting permission slips
[03/07/2005 10:15 PM] AZJRJ: yes, but we can't even pass rated R movies
[03/07/2005 10:15 PM] WG Wise Master: isn't there a form for being allowed to watch R movies?
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] WG Wise Master: i thought there was a form?
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] WG Wise Master: (schindlers list)
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] AZJRJ: the district only approves of like 1 or 2 list
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] AZJRJ: movies, not list
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] AZJRJ: yeah, that is 1 of the 2
[03/07/2005 10:16 PM] AZJRJ: need premission slip for that, even thought it is approved

[03/07/2005 10:24 PM] AZJRJ: 16 would be a lot in a practice room....
[03/07/2005 10:24 PM] WG Wise Master: sure is
[03/07/2005 10:24 PM] WG Wise Master: we could do 2 rooms
[03/07/2005 10:24 PM] WG Wise Master: and playstation in the 3rd
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] WG Wise Master: and there is the movie room practice rooms
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: i wanted game cube =(
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: movie was going to be in the band room
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: on that wall
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: i believe
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: i have to go to bed, need to discuss this in detail
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: i'm os excited!
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] AZJRJ: bye
[03/07/2005 10:25 PM] WG Wise Master: wait
[03/07/2005 10:26 PM] WG Wise Master: i don't understand
[03/07/2005 10:26 PM] WG Wise Master: why is the movie going in the band room
[03/07/2005 10:26 PM] WG Wise Master: when the band is already a common meeting room
[03/07/2005 10:26 PM] WG Wise Master: that is where people should be able to socialize
[03/07/2005 10:27 PM] WG Wise Master: there is the same kind of wall in the other room
[03/07/2005 10:28 PM] WG Wise Master: people find comfort in the band room, they should be free to do what the wish
[03/07/2005 10:29 PM] WG Wise Master: and with background music that will allow them to do so
[03/07/2005 10:29 PM] WG Wise Master: they don't want to have to be quiet for the people watching the movie
[03/07/2005 10:29 PM] WG Wise Master: why not hold the extra activities in the other room, so the people watching to movie will be forced to pause it
[03/07/2005 10:30 PM] AZJRJ: well, i'm not sure when we get the chorus room
[03/07/2005 10:31 PM] AZJRJ: we can move the movie over to the other building
[03/07/2005 10:31 PM] AZJRJ: i mean room
[03/07/2005 10:31 PM] AZJRJ: we will see... it's still being worked on, so bare with me
[03/07/2005 10:31 PM] AZJRJ: going to bed, goodnight
[03/07/2005 10:41 PM] WG Wise Master: if we put the music in the band room we can start it off right away
[03/07/2005 10:41 PM] WG Wise Master: than after chorus is finished we can start the first movie
[03/07/2005 10:45 PM] WG Wise Master: otherwise, we start a movie in the band room, and everyone will be forced to be quiet, even while we are going to get food and everyone is going to be coming in and wanting to socialize but won't be able to, then we won't be able to set up the music because they will be watching a movie, and then on top of all that you want to just move the happy band kids watching the movie into another room?

[03/15/2005 03:01 PM] Jeffrey: here is my letter
[03/15/2005 03:01 PM] Jeffrey: Dear Miss Stemm,
  
  Thanks for everything, I wish you the best of luck at RMU and hope lacrosse goes well.  I agree it is everybody else's fault.  I will personally take all the blame, since I deserve it.  I'm glad you can see my intentions are fake, and that quite possibly I most likely am.  You see truth, and I commend you for it.  I will send you a post card from California, and hope you pin it up on your wall.  I will cry because I treasure our friendship is struggling.  Hopefully my sex organs will be able to perform once the time is right!  
  
[03/15/2005 03:02 PM] Jeffrey: actually, i will not write that

[03/17/2005 09:51 PM] Me: limos suck and i will tell you why from my experience at working at a resort IF you tell me who made drum majors
[03/17/2005 09:51 PM] Jeffrey: i have an idea
[03/17/2005 09:51 PM] Jeffrey: but i did not make the final call

[03/17/2005 09:53 PM] Me: fine
[03/17/2005 09:53 PM] Me: let me tell you why limos are a waste of money
[03/17/2005 09:53 PM] Jeffrey: watching these tryouts made me want to join U of A band so badly
[03/17/2005 09:53 PM] Jeffrey: i can't wait to do another 4 years of band!
[03/17/2005 09:53 PM] Me: you should
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Me: want to know why limos suck?
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Me: you will like this
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Me: ok
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Jeffrey: ok, why do limos suck?
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Me: first off, granted they are a status symbol, they tell everyone else that you have the money to waste on a longer car than theirs
[03/17/2005 09:54 PM] Me: but they suck because
[03/17/2005 09:55 PM] Jeffrey: it's for the experience
[03/17/2005 09:59 PM] Me: 1.  most of them are old because they are to expensive to replace
 2.  since they are old, they look old on the outside, they are poorly maintained by all drivers
 3.  you would be lucky to get a limo with the fancy things like LCD screens and DVD players without wasting more money
 4.  most of them will just have a crappy refrigerator and a VCR, maybe, not even that, because they are old
 5.  good luck communicating with the driver, none of them speak english, and they definitely don't care about you
 6.  bench seats suck
 7.  have fun yelling to eachother because with as many people as it would take to pay for a crappy old limo, there will be to many people to hear any conversations
 8.  bench seats suck
 9.  they have tiny ceilings and someone is most likely going to get claustrophobic and freak out
 10.  have fun getting in and out of your crappy old bench seated limo
[03/17/2005 09:59 PM] Me: you're welcome
[03/17/2005 10:00 PM] Jeffrey: still did not pursuade me not to get one
[03/17/2005 10:00 PM] Me: Transtyle: 480-948-6131, call them, tell them you want a 2004 escalade to pick you up
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Me: the drivers speak english
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Me: and escalades are better anyways
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Me: and Transtyle has taxi priced fairs
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Me: *fares
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Me: much better idea
[03/17/2005 10:01 PM] Jeffrey: ok
[03/17/2005 10:02 PM] Me: you're not really gonna call them are you?
[03/17/2005 10:02 PM] Me: they also have limos, ALWAYS COMPARE PRICES!
[03/17/2005 10:02 PM] Me: call a few places
[03/17/2005 10:02 PM] Me: could save you some money, prom is not a cheap undertaking, so every little bit should help
[03/17/2005 10:03 PM] Me: might save enough to pay for desert at this Japanese place your going to, wouldn't that be convenient?
[03/17/2005 10:03 PM] Me: i'll see you there

[01/08/2006 10:24 PM] Me: When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside-down, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C. 
  
 the Russians used a pencil. Your taxes are due again--enjoy paying them.
