[12/29/2005 12:16 AM] Samuel Guerrero: It's about a person who God tells all people their fate is tied to. When he dies, the world dies with him. It would be about how he would be treated. Suddenly the most important issue in the world os preserving this guy as long as possible and who would get to do it. There would be those who want him to die. It would be interesting to see how he was allowed to interact. A typical lifestyle would be out of the question. He would have to be isolated, but not so much as to keep him too far from help. He wouldn't be allowed to see people who might want to hurt him. There will international debates over who should watch him. He wouldn't be allowed outside for the danger of stray bullets. He wouldn't be allowed inside for fear that a building might collapse. No one would be allowed near him except for his caretakers who in turn will be criticized no matter who they would be. Physicians would argue over what methods of medicine would be the most effective for insuring his survival. Etc.
