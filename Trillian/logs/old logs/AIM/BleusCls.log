[02/08/2004 04:29 PM] BleusCls: Dear AIM users, 
 
 Because of our overloading of our servers, we are being forced to extract our non-active AIM users. Because this is a free service, AOL has exceeded the budget for the AIM service. We are asking that you send this exact message to 20 other AIM users to ensure us that you're an active AIM user. Our system tracking devise will pick up this message to keep you on our active list. You have 72 hours to complete this task or your service will be cancelled immediately. Starting August 10, 2004 we will be charging a small fee for registering of a screen name for AIM. Thank you for your time and for using AOL or AIM

"Tomo sana te bilastat" were the words spoken, and now you have read them... anyone who reads the chant will meet this small child ... in the middle of the night she will be on your ceiling as you sleep she will suffocate you as she was suffocated unless you send this to at least 20 people
