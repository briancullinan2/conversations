BJCullinan: Stereo of Joint Stereo?
S A McVey: Huh?
BJCullinan: which one do we have?
BJCullinan: on the computer?
S A McVey: Never heard of joint stereo...
S A McVey: What is it?
BJCullinan: i don't know
S A McVey: And who is asking?
BJCullinan: just an option on how to copy this music
S A McVey: Using what?
BJCullinan: dbPowerAMP
S A McVey: I'd just go with Stereo.
BJCullinan: ok

BJCullinan: the little brats where being to loud this morning so i went out and turned off there game, but since they didn't bust in my room and try to take the dvd player i woke up just in time to take it to them out in the drive way
BJCullinan: so u know there are those few times that i am nice
S A McVey: And you're telling me this so you can get in troublke?
BJCullinan: no just to tell you that i am not always mean like you say
S A McVey: I don't think being mean first, then doing something nice is what I had in mind.
BJCullinan: well i could have been mean and not have done anything nice
S A McVey: True. Now we need to work on the fact that you need to punish everyone twice over for something you think they might have done to you.
S A McVey: I don't think they turned up the volume to make you mad, dod you?
BJCullinan: well maybe if they weren't so inconciderate and were quite in the morning this would have started off as a good day and i would have been able to be nice without the mean
BJCullinan: no they were talking
S A McVey: So its their fault.... And now you can do whatever you want?
BJCullinan: they were talking at a normal tone and it was very annoying
S A McVey: Then just tell them that, and if it continues you have a right to complain (but not get all hot and turn off their game). 
S A McVey: SOme day one of them will punch your lights out.
BJCullinan: maybe so
S A McVey: And who will you have to blame?
BJCullinan: me
S A McVey: Exactly...
S A McVey: So... undestand that you set the tone here. If you want to live being a hot-head and getting into fights/arguments, then keep on doing it the way you are.
BJCullinan: then how about the time hunter was making andrews airplanes with that special paper, i told him you shouldn't do that andrew might get mad, why don't you wait til andrew gets home so you can ask him before you make any more
S A McVey: ??
BJCullinan: andrew gets home and hunter explains what i said obviously in a crude way because andrew gets all steamed up at me and says you have no right to tell him he can't ruin my planes
S A McVey: I don't understand.
BJCullinan: so no one appriciates the few nice things i do maybe i should just live up to what i am called every day
S A McVey: Your choice. You have to earn trust and respect. If no one believes you will act in a nice way, they will expect you to be mean (and you will gladly give it to them).
S A McVey: It's up to you to get a different reputation.

BJCullinan: ok
S A McVey: I stink at golf but I think it is fun.
BJCullinan: i stink and i don't think its fun
S A McVey: Have you gone on a real golf course?
BJCullinan: yeah
BJCullinan: couple times with my dad
S A McVey: Too bad you don't like it. That would be a way to get 4 hours of his undivided attention.
BJCullinan: probably
BJCullinan: but u know what they say, if your parents are crazy about something you are probably the opposite
S A McVey: Worked out fine for Tiger Woods...
BJCullinan: well sometimes
