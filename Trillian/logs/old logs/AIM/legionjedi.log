[02/10/2004 11:42 AM] Josh: lol
[02/10/2004 11:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am not sure exactly what is in the file, so if this doesn't work we'll have to go about it a different way
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] Josh: would it be easier to talk
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] Josh: over the phone
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: you extracted the zipped file to c:\misc\
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] Josh: yeah
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: no then you can keep this window open
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: go to the desktop and right click my computer, and select properties
[02/10/2004 11:44 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:44 AM] BrianJCullinan: click the advanced hardware tab at the top and click the Device Manager button
[02/10/2004 11:44 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: in that list find the current printer drivers installed
[02/10/2004 11:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: ours will look different because mine is a network printer
[02/10/2004 11:45 AM] Josh: yeah
[02/10/2004 11:45 AM] Josh: it says hp laserjet 1300 (dot4)
[02/10/2004 11:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: is there any other?
[02/10/2004 11:46 AM] Josh: no
[02/10/2004 11:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: what section is that under?
[02/10/2004 11:46 AM] Josh: something called dotusb hpz12
[02/10/2004 11:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok that sounds like it
[02/10/2004 11:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: right click on that hp laserjet item
[02/10/2004 11:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: and select update driver
[02/10/2004 11:47 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] Josh: it asks for windows to connect to wind update
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: the first screen should be asking if you want windows to connect to the internet to find a new driver select no and continue
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: on the following screen you want the second option
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: install from a spacific location
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: on the next uncheck the removable drive box
[02/10/2004 11:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: but do check the include this location
[02/10/2004 11:49 AM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 11:49 AM] Josh: than choose from the list
[02/10/2004 11:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: when that becomes enabled, click browse and point it to c:\misc
[02/10/2004 11:51 AM] Josh: umm. is there a wy to type that in
[02/10/2004 11:51 AM] BrianJCullinan: can't you just use the browse?
[02/10/2004 11:51 AM] BrianJCullinan: but yes you can type it in in the box
[02/10/2004 11:53 AM] Josh: k it said something like the wizard could not find a better match for your hardware than the software u alrady have
[02/10/2004 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[02/10/2004 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: are you sure the drivers are not already correct
[02/10/2004 11:54 AM] Josh: maybe i should try downloading the other driver
[02/10/2004 11:54 AM] Josh: see thats the thing
[02/10/2004 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: it could be the software isn't configured correctly
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] Josh: see thats the thing i wan to talk to this computer dude
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] BrianJCullinan: downloading random drivers won't help
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] Josh: but  i cant
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] Josh: this is what the comp guy siad
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] Josh: who is in michigan where the server is
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] BrianJCullinan: are you using the software from the computer with the printer connected to it?
[02/10/2004 11:55 AM] Josh: but im not sure if he really evalated the situation right
[02/10/2004 11:56 AM] Josh: wat do mean exacctly
[02/10/2004 11:56 AM] Josh: u see when we connect to the server
[02/10/2004 11:56 AM] Josh: we go over the remote desktop connection
[02/10/2004 11:56 AM] BrianJCullinan: from a programers stand point i would say if the software is being run on a computer with a print there is no reason why the software shouldn't be able to print, it doesn't really have anything to do with the server at all
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: do you use windows remote desktop?
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: the one built in
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] Josh: see i really o think it is the software thats the problem
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] Josh: yes the one built in
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: ahhh!
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: i c now
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: that could also cause problems
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: that might try to print to the printer on the server that isn't there
[02/10/2004 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: you need to search on microsoft help to find that answer
[02/10/2004 11:58 AM] BrianJCullinan: (Link: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;312135)http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;312135
[02/10/2004 11:58 AM] Josh: can i call u
[02/10/2004 11:58 AM] BrianJCullinan: perfect
[02/10/2004 11:59 AM] BrianJCullinan: follow those directions, it address your problem exactly
[02/10/2004 11:59 AM] Josh: can i still call u though
[02/10/2004 11:59 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'm doing homework
[02/10/2004 11:59 AM] Josh: oh
[02/10/2004 11:59 AM] Josh: i c
[02/10/2004 12:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: try that first and just open up a word document in the remote connection and print a test page ok?
[02/10/2004 12:00 PM] Josh: k
[02/10/2004 12:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: if that works, then when you go to use the software you should see your printer, make sure you have the right one selected
[02/10/2004 12:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: the directions look pretty good to me

[02/10/2004 12:14 PM] Josh: its bull hit
[02/10/2004 12:14 PM] Josh: im telling my dad i cant f******* fix anything if i cant do my thing
[02/10/2004 12:14 PM] Josh: anyway
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: i followed the instructionand everythig that it said to do was already checked
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: marked
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: so
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: ........
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: so to be honest with u it migth not be that
[02/10/2004 12:15 PM] Josh: i can always try
[02/10/2004 12:16 PM] Josh: cause if evrythig was aleady checked than those option were already in place
[02/10/2004 12:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: well go ahead and try printing out of microsoft word or some other higher end software
[02/10/2004 12:16 PM] Josh: that wors 
[02/10/2004 12:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: if it works there then you can be sure it is the database software causing problems
[02/10/2004 12:16 PM] Josh: its just a matter of printing form that bloody softwar
[02/10/2004 12:17 PM] Josh: so im just wodering

[02/10/2004 12:18 PM] Josh: and lok at the problem
[02/10/2004 12:18 PM] Josh: and im thinking thats the best idea
[02/10/2004 12:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably a good idea since i don't know much about the software
[02/10/2004 12:18 PM] Josh: caue i still have two comps that need to be fixed anyway
[02/10/2004 12:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah

[04/11/2004 08:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: but probably not any certain freshmen
[04/11/2004 08:12 PM] Josh: ha
[04/11/2004 08:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'd like to invite the usual group because i am comfortable around them, but i figured i shouldn't waste my time
[04/11/2004 08:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: none of them talk to me anyways
[04/11/2004 08:12 PM] Josh: oh
[04/11/2004 08:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: everytime i am around only like 3 people actually acknowledge that i am there
[04/11/2004 08:13 PM] Josh: who might that be ?
[04/11/2004 08:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: so probably you, jeffrey, mike, eric, derek, andy, andrea, i don't expect them to stay long

[04/11/2004 08:14 PM] Josh: hhhmmm
[04/11/2004 08:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: i guess i will just invite them because of how pathetic my social life is, no one else would come anyways
[04/11/2004 08:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: they'll probably not even show up because of work or something
[04/11/2004 08:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i'm gonna go play video games

[01/14/2005 04:02 PM] *** Auto-response from Josh: The problem is we don't believe ourselves to be as much alike as we are. Whites and blacks, catholics and protestants, men and women, rich and poor, gays and straights. If we saw eachother as more alike, we might be very eager to join in one big human family in this world, and care about that family the way we care about our own. We all have the same beginning-birth-and the same end-death. So how different can we be?
