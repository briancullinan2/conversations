[06/06/2005 10:55 PM] Me: that last time that happened was before i started dating my first girlfriend
[06/06/2005 10:55 PM] Me: *sigh*
[06/06/2005 10:56 PM] Greg M: uh huh....
[06/06/2005 10:56 PM] Greg M: well
[06/06/2005 10:56 PM] Greg M: clearly
[06/06/2005 10:56 PM] Greg M: you

[06/06/2005 10:56 PM] Me: ...?
[06/06/2005 10:57 PM] Me: I hated going to weddings. All the grandmas would poke me saying "You're next". They stopped that when I started doing it to them at funerals.
[06/06/2005 10:57 PM] Me: A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.
[06/06/2005 10:59 PM] Me: lol
[06/06/2005 10:59 PM] Me: alright back to the video games for another half an hour

[06/06/2005 11:09 PM] Greg M: this other girl that you have never met
[06/06/2005 11:09 PM] Me: what happened?
[06/06/2005 11:09 PM] Greg M: well
[06/06/2005 11:10 PM] Greg M: everyone who knew about this thought that me n her were gonna hook up n stuff then she decided to go out with this other guy instead and fuck him instead of me dammit and not only was i surprised but so was everyone else and we were all like "wam bam what the fuck just happened?"

[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Greg M: maybe not that far
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Me: we  at first i thought she was strange
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Greg M: like when u frist started liking her or sumthin
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Me: kinda funny looking
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Me: and joe was pushing her around in the parking lot
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Me: i thought it was sad
[06/06/2005 11:40 PM] Me: then when i started liking her
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Me: i still thought she was strange
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Greg M: thats not a good satrt
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Me: but she kind of grew on me i guess
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Greg M: go into detail here i want a good story
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Me: and the more i watched her prance around the room in english class, the closer i wanted to be to her
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Greg M: so this just started last year?
[06/06/2005 11:41 PM] Me: but she was always talking to other guys, and other girls, and shes all popular and everything
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: yes during senior school year
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Greg M: so u felt like what?
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Greg M: intimidated?
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: exactly
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: you're good at this
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: and somehow i got her cell phone
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Greg M: :-D
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: i can't even remember how!
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Greg M: whatever works
[06/06/2005 11:42 PM] Me: maybe i asked for it
[06/06/2005 11:43 PM] Greg M: maybe
[06/06/2005 11:43 PM] Me: and then somehow i got her SN
[06/06/2005 11:43 PM] Me: i can't remember how i got that either!
[06/06/2005 11:43 PM] Me: its amazing
[06/06/2005 11:43 PM] Greg M: you were so overwhelemed with anxiety that your brain processed it as something else similar to getting extrememly drunk and not remembering a thing from the night before
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: so we talked and talked and talked
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: for a long time
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: like all year
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: and she was just a friend
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Greg M: ah yes how it all begins
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: infact at first i thought it would be a good way to get close to frankie
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Greg M: o yeah i rememebr that
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: but around second semester she wasn't really all that appealing
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: shes really not that good looking
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Greg M: still had i nice ass tho
[06/06/2005 11:44 PM] Me: and she doesn't even have that great of body
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: kind of thick actually
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: so that's when i started to like chelsea
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: because she was cute
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: and more fun to talk to them frankie
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: she has more of a personality
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: frankie is just kind of a dumb blonde
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Greg M: thats what drinking does to ya
[06/06/2005 11:45 PM] Me: chelsea actually tries not to be dumb
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Greg M: gives u personality
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: and it works for her
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: chelsea drinks?
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Greg M: and most ppl
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Greg M: probably
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: but shhh you'll ruin her innocence
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: anywho
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: chelsea is cute
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Greg M: you should really try it sometime
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Me: shes got a nice body
[06/06/2005 11:46 PM] Greg M: it can be quite fun if you dont go over your limit
[06/06/2005 11:47 PM] Me: and after i saw what she was wearing to my party, i just about creamed
[06/06/2005 11:47 PM] Greg M: now deep down

[06/06/2005 11:47 PM] Me: i like being close to her
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Me: and i don't want to be too touchy feely
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Greg M: do u get nervous when she comes nearby
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Me: because i know that she isn't
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Greg M: like butterflies
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Greg M: in the stomach u kno
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Me: not really nervous, i am really comfortable around her
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Me: but yeah kind of
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Greg M: mmhmm
[06/06/2005 11:48 PM] Me: like i feel comfortable, but i want to be closer to her
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Greg M: do u ever want to say something to her but just lose the words even though you have been thinking about it for however long?
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Me: yeah sometimes
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Greg M: uh huh now what kin dof things would that be?
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Greg M: like u want to ask her out but then be like no i cant
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Greg M: or what?
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Me: like when we are talking online sometimes i want to say something, but the conversation doesn't go where i plan so i have to think of something else
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Me: i don't know if i want to ask her out
[06/06/2005 11:49 PM] Greg M: what about it person
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Me: i want her to get away from joe
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Me: so i kind of push her a little
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Me: i want to ask her out on a dae
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Greg M: kuz online anyone can say anything then just say jk if they want to take it back
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Me: *date
[06/06/2005 11:50 PM] Me: but not a permanent relationship just like the kind she already has
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: so u want to date her but not be too serious?
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: so like
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: the occasional kissing and hugging etc
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: maybe at the end of the night when u drop her off?
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Me: well maybe a little more then that
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Me: that's boring
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: well
[06/06/2005 11:51 PM] Greg M: thats where it starts
[06/06/2005 11:52 PM] Me: more like the few times a week until it becomes a mutual un-ruined by words decision to stick together in more of a BF/GF relationship
[06/06/2005 11:52 PM] Greg M: then from there things progress (usually unless ur girl is a backstabbing bitch who 'hired the drunk')
[06/06/2005 11:52 PM] Me: lol yeah
[06/06/2005 11:52 PM] Me: like that
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Me: that would be perfect
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Me: progress
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Me: slowly
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Me: no need to rush
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Greg M: 'then the whores come in'
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Greg M: yes
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Greg M: thats usuallty the best way to build a strong standing relationshipo
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Greg M: see
[06/06/2005 11:53 PM] Me: like when we were talking and she told me to go to her house and drag her out of bed, i really wanted to
[06/06/2005 11:54 PM] Me: just so that i could see her
[06/06/2005 11:54 PM] Me: ... would have been a good start
[06/06/2005 11:54 PM] Greg M: if u rush into it u miss the parts where you actually learn from each other and really get to know each other deep down and if u miss out on that then ask yourslef what am i doing with this person who i know nothing about
[06/06/2005 11:54 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Me: good explanation
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Greg M: well you dont want to be too serious about a joke or something sarcastic like that though
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Me: now i just have to think of a way to ask her
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Greg M: now
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Greg M: lemme say this
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Greg M: for a min
[06/06/2005 11:55 PM] Greg M: u could take something like that and build on it
[06/06/2005 11:56 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:56 PM] Greg M: what you can do is tell her that youll be over in a few minutes (jokingly of course) get her to laugh kuz u said before she was all depressed or whatever the case
[06/06/2005 11:56 PM] Greg M: cheer her up
[06/06/2005 11:56 PM] Greg M: then from that you could go on and ask her what she wants to do when u pull her out of bed
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Me: very creative
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Me: hmmm
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Greg M: then if she doesnt know suggest something like lunch
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Me: *ponders*
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Greg M: nothing too serious like dinner and a movie yet
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Greg M: just something casual
[06/06/2005 11:57 PM] Greg M: and lunch is perfect for that
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Greg M: you can go anywhere (just no target or fast food etc)
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Greg M: something like
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Greg M: islands maybe
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Me: but heather works there
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Greg M: somehting where you sit down and get waited on and everything
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Greg M: that was an ecxample there are plenty of others
[06/06/2005 11:58 PM] Me: i know

[06/06/2005 11:59 PM] Me: whole nother story
[06/06/2005 11:59 PM] Greg M: now if its too late for lunch you can suggest that you go the next day
[06/06/2005 11:59 PM] Greg M: lol
[06/06/2005 11:59 PM] Me: yeah
[06/06/2005 11:59 PM] Greg M: but you dont want her to get the upper hand of when u go out because then she might never decide and u will lose all of it right there
[06/07/2005 12:00 AM] Me: yeah
[06/07/2005 12:00 AM] Greg M: so YOU decide when to go and let her pick a place but mke sure u suggest something
[06/07/2005 12:00 AM] Greg M: of course 
[06/07/2005 12:00 AM] Me: ok
[06/07/2005 12:00 AM] Greg M: make sure that shes not cancelling other stuff to go to lunch with you kuz then u will seem like u are controlling her and shes not gonna want that
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: yeah
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: good idea
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Greg M: make sure its convenient for her and u should probably be free all the time im guessing
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: yeah
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: i have all week
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Greg M: yeah i figured
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: so maybe i will do that when she gets back
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Greg M: dont tell her that tho
[06/07/2005 12:01 AM] Me: yeah i know
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Greg M: you dont want to seem available all the time
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Me: make it seem like you are doing something for her because shes special
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Greg M: there ya go
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Me: and girls like to feel special
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Greg M: now
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Greg M: when u are out assuming it gets that far
[06/07/2005 12:02 AM] Greg M: im sure she will dress up nice for you so you look good too
[06/07/2005 12:03 AM] Me: yeah i could wear my 100% silk

[07/09/2005 12:28 AM] Me: you have to make every side of them blend together
[07/09/2005 12:28 AM] Me: that's for basic textures
[07/09/2005 12:28 AM] Me: you will also be in charge of skinning everything
[07/09/2005 12:29 AM] Me: all the new models are going to need textures and skins
[07/09/2005 12:29 AM] Me: skins are the hard part

[07/09/2005 12:30 AM] Greg M: now what kind of story do u want?
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Greg M: something similar to HL2?
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Greg M: like u vs the "bad guy"
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Me: we don't know yet
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Greg M: or more like HL
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Greg M: or completely different
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Me: we are just getting the SDKs downloaded
[07/09/2005 12:31 AM] Greg M: ok

[07/09/2005 12:32 AM] Greg M: yeah
[07/09/2005 12:32 AM] Me: he is going to need a lot of help with that
[07/09/2005 12:32 AM] Greg M: yeah

[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Greg M: it kinda got deleted with the rest of my HDD
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Me: a story?
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Me: for a game?
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Greg M: no 
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Me: or just a story?

[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Me: oh
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Greg M: but it could easily be made into a game
[07/09/2005 12:35 AM] Greg M: with some changes
[07/09/2005 12:36 AM] Greg M: and luckily i still remember it all partly in fact because i wrote it all
[07/09/2005 12:36 AM] Me: hmm
[07/09/2005 12:36 AM] Greg M: and an HL2 mod would actually work quite well to make this into a game
[07/09/2005 12:37 AM] Me: hmmm
[07/09/2005 12:37 AM] Greg M: although there would be no multiplayer part to it
[07/09/2005 12:37 AM] Me: well type some stuff up
[07/09/2005 12:37 AM] Greg M: well

[07/29/2005 12:56 AM] Greg M: i dunno
[07/29/2005 12:56 AM] Greg M: for one make it so the little frame thing doesnt move around
[07/29/2005 12:56 AM] Me: the PSP screen is a different ratio then the car picture, so something is going to be cut off

[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Me: like we could do anything
[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Me: if we have the right tool to cut the metal
[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Greg Miraglia: yes u could
[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Me: that will be the hardest part
[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Greg Miraglia: so a dremel?
[11/15/2005 08:47 PM] Greg Miraglia: lol
[11/15/2005 08:48 PM] Me: and we will get cases for free, because people will pay us like 60-80 dollars a case and give us their old one
[11/15/2005 08:48 PM] Me: did you look at that picture online?
[11/15/2005 08:48 PM] Greg Miraglia: and what will u do with their old ones?

[11/15/2005 08:48 PM] Greg Miraglia: how did they do that?
[11/15/2005 08:48 PM] Me: english custom polishing
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Me: do you think chrome polish would do that well/
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Me: ?
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Me: dan seems to think so
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Greg Miraglia: say what?
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Greg Miraglia: do i think what do do how well at what?
[11/15/2005 08:49 PM] Greg Miraglia: and what is english custom polishing
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Me: Dan thinks that chrome polish could do what that picture was
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Greg Miraglia: o
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Greg Miraglia: umm
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Me: make it mirror that good
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Me: i think it will be more foggy then in the picture
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Greg Miraglia: well as far as i know polish is just like a finish that u put on something that is already (in ur case) chrome
[11/15/2005 08:50 PM] Greg Miraglia: polish just goes on to make it shiny again
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: yeah this guy MADE the mirror
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: (Link: http://metku.net/mods/shinyshuttle/final5.jpg)http://metku.net/mods/shinyshuttle/final5.jpg
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Greg Miraglia: ur gonna hafta do something to make it shine and be chrome first
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: he sanded off the paint and used the polish and wet sand paper to MAKE the mirror
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: it wasn't mirrored
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: its regular aluminum
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Greg Miraglia: ok well do that then
[11/15/2005 08:51 PM] Me: yeah its amazing
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: thats a lot of sanding tho just a warning
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Me: so that's what we will do to a side panel and an entire case
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: yerah
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: *yeah
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Me: yeah i would imagine but it will build so much muscle
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: lol umm
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Me: if we do them regularly holy shit
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: maybe make ur arm a little tired
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 08:52 PM] Greg Miraglia: and then u switch off
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: if anything
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: ur forearms
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Me: lol yeah
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: of course if u were smart
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Me: we will trade off
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: u would just use one of those sanding machine things
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Me: Dan has some power tools to do the hard stuff
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: itll go much faster and not make ur arm tired
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Me: yeah Dan has one
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: i kno
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: weve used it
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Me: at least to get the beige paint off
[11/15/2005 08:53 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Me: then we will probably have to do most the other stuff manually
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Me: and i talked to my dad and he said he would send me acrylic, he'll even laser cut it for free
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Greg Miraglia: like to practice or sumthin?
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Greg Miraglia: or what
[11/15/2005 08:54 PM] Me: like whenever i need it
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: o
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: kool
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: build me a case then
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Me: he gets it for $1 square foot
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: nice
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: clear?
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Me: its fucking hard to build cases
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Me: but if our project is successful then we will sell the first one and if you find a beige case we will mod it for you
[11/15/2005 08:55 PM] Greg Miraglia: how bout grey?
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Me: no prob
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: kuz mine is grey
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Me: we will put one of those designs in the side of it
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: umm
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: ill make my own design
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Me: or that
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Me: it can't be to complicated
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Me: my dad might be able to laser or water cut it
[11/15/2005 08:56 PM] Greg Miraglia: but ur a professional u hafta be able to take on the toughest of all clients
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Me: maybe
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Greg Miraglia: lmao
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Me: not sure how precise we can go
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Greg Miraglia: and take on the toughest critics...
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Me: we will figure all this out thanksgiving break
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Greg Miraglia: yourself... and if ur a comedian...jews
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Me: i already have a beige case to mod
[11/15/2005 08:57 PM] Greg Miraglia: ok
[11/15/2005 09:00 PM] Me: and if i can't sell it i will give it to my brother and take his beige one and get more practice

[11/15/2005 09:00 PM] Greg Miraglia: now?
[11/15/2005 09:00 PM] Greg Miraglia: its pretty plain
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: the benefit of putting a mirror on these is we don't have to worry about scratching it
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: but yours is painted
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Greg Miraglia: lol
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: so scratches will show up
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Greg Miraglia: its already got a scratch on top
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: that could be a problem
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: then we could just sand off all the paint and mirror yours too
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah i dunno whatever
[11/15/2005 09:01 PM] Me: but that would be mean to your case
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Me: beige cases are ungly
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: if i decide to rip apart my compy for that ill let u know
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Me: *ugly
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: yes they are
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Me: ok
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Me: because you really will have to take absolutely everything out of it
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: i know
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Me: and we will have to tear the case apart too
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: ill do that
[11/15/2005 09:02 PM] Greg Miraglia: i know how it comes apart
[11/15/2005 09:03 PM] Greg Miraglia: and ill hafta jack a case from james to use while u are working on this one
[11/15/2005 09:03 PM] Greg Miraglia: kuz hes got another one exactly the same as mine

[11/15/2005 09:08 PM] Greg Miraglia: but as far as i kno hes not doing anything with them
[11/15/2005 09:08 PM] Greg Miraglia: so ask
[11/15/2005 09:08 PM] Greg Miraglia: then have fun wiring them up

[11/15/2005 09:09 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah
[11/15/2005 09:09 PM] Greg Miraglia: kuz u hafta use some good wire
[11/15/2005 09:09 PM] Greg Miraglia: and everything has to be completely insulated
[11/15/2005 09:09 PM] Greg Miraglia: and then i dunno what u plan to do about power
[11/15/2005 09:10 PM] Me: we will hook it up to the computer power supply
[11/15/2005 09:10 PM] Me: i have tutorials
[11/15/2005 09:10 PM] Greg Miraglia: ok
[11/15/2005 09:10 PM] Greg Miraglia: 4pin?
[11/15/2005 09:10 PM] Me: on how much power and what resisters to use
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Me: a 4 pin extention probably, like the kind your fan comes with
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Greg Miraglia: well im assuming that the power supply uses a standard 12V so i think ull be ok for that
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Me: its 12v and 5v
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Greg Miraglia: yeah whwtever it is
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Me: and some LEDs come with built in resistors
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Me: and the two grounds
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Greg Miraglia: but yeah u could use the fan thing and then just solder on the pins u need
[11/15/2005 09:11 PM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 09:12 PM] Me: we might just be able to buy them

[11/16/2005 09:28 AM] Me: i am also gonna make it so that during the longest day of the year and the shortest day of the yeah it changes
[11/16/2005 09:28 AM] Greg Miraglia: have like rain in the background or sumthin?
[11/16/2005 09:28 AM] Greg Miraglia: kool
[11/16/2005 09:28 AM] Me: maybe rain
[11/16/2005 09:29 AM] Me: i might have a few different sets of clouds
[11/16/2005 09:29 AM] Greg Miraglia: it should all be based off the weather in ur local area bekuz in some places the sun is down at like 4:30  as opposed to here where its like 6
[11/16/2005 09:30 AM] Greg Miraglia: and in like alaska this time of the year the sun never really goes down all the way:-P
[11/16/2005 09:31 AM] Greg Miraglia: but thats just my 2 cents
[11/16/2005 09:32 AM] Me: yeah
[11/16/2005 09:32 AM] Greg Miraglia: and that would probably make it a lot harder
[11/16/2005 09:35 AM] Greg Miraglia: but that would be awesome if it was perfect with the conditions outside
[11/16/2005 09:36 AM] Me: yeah
[11/16/2005 09:36 AM] Greg Miraglia: and maybe
[11/16/2005 09:37 AM] Greg Miraglia: if its not to diffucult to animate
[11/16/2005 09:37 AM] Greg Miraglia: have like falling rain or snow hail whatever in the background
[11/16/2005 09:40 AM] Me: yeah
