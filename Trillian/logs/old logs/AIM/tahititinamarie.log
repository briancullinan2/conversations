[03/06/2006 11:41 PM] Christina Sanders: just wondering, i haven't seen you around since marching band
[03/06/2006 11:41 PM] Me: yeah i'm not "into it" (the whole music thing)
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: ah, why were you in marching band then?
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Me: i did it all 4 years of high school
[03/06/2006 11:43 PM] Christina Sanders: and couldn't quit quite yet?
[03/06/2006 11:43 PM] Me: i built a lot of strong relationships in highschool through band and i thought that in college i would enjoy the community just as much
[03/06/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: well did you (here?)
[03/06/2006 11:44 PM] Me: no
[03/06/2006 11:44 PM] Me: i don't believe in recognition fraternities 
[03/06/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: sorry to hear that
[03/06/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: ahhh
[03/06/2006 11:45 PM] Me: so i didn't feel like there was a strong community
[03/06/2006 11:45 PM] Me: its so dynamic changing from year to year from what i hear, and i just didn't feel as close to anyone in band as i did previous years
[03/06/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: well looking back, the band was not as motivated or really cared about the season
[03/06/2006 11:47 PM] Christina Sanders: most of the kids in there were forced to be there for scholarships or their studios
[03/06/2006 11:47 PM] Christina Sanders: and these were the kids who hated marching band
[03/06/2006 11:47 PM] Me: yeah
[03/06/2006 11:47 PM] Me: so i am thinking about doing it one more semester
[03/06/2006 11:47 PM] Me: i don't know
[03/06/2006 11:49 PM] Christina Sanders: i think you should ... from what i know next year should be much better (in regards to morale, music etc)
[03/06/2006 11:49 PM] Christina Sanders: i know that another big reason for last season not being as fun as it should have was due to our poorly designed show 
[03/06/2006 11:50 PM] Christina Sanders: dont get me wrong i love the doobie brothers, but ms jones designed that show barely  weeks before band camp and was writing drills while we were learning them!
[03/06/2006 11:51 PM] Me: yeah
[03/06/2006 11:52 PM] Christina Sanders: sorry you get me going on band especially marching band .. i just can't stop
[03/06/2006 11:52 PM] Christina Sanders: i probably should join band geeks anonymous ... 
[03/06/2006 11:52 PM] Me: yea band kids do that
[03/06/2006 11:52 PM] Me: lol
[03/06/2006 11:53 PM] Me: hey well, i really enjoyed talking to you and hanging out with you but i g2g to bed

[03/08/2006 10:59 AM] Christina Sanders: feeling much better
[03/08/2006 10:59 AM] Me: how come you weren't feeling good?
[03/08/2006 11:00 AM] Christina Sanders: i have been sick since sunday and finally this morning, i finally am starting to feel better than i have been
[03/08/2006 11:00 AM] Me: well that's good
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Me: you going to be on much longer?
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Christina Sanders: not too much i have class at 11:30
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Me: oh ok
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Christina Sanders: why do you ask?
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Me: hey i really enjoyed hanging out with you last night
[03/08/2006 11:01 AM] Me: no reason just wanted to talk
[03/08/2006 11:02 AM] Christina Sanders: i really enjoyed myself last night too... thanks for inviting me over
[03/08/2006 11:03 AM] Me: i'm going to go out on a limb here, you're very attractive and fun to be around, if i wasn't already involved with someone i would totally want to date you, but like i said, i'm already involved with someone.  but i'm also not the only one that think that, i think you can imagine the other person i'm talking about
[03/08/2006 11:03 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah i think can imagine
[03/08/2006 11:04 AM] Christina Sanders: to be honest i am not surprised about both of you
[03/08/2006 11:05 AM] Me: that obvious?
[03/08/2006 11:05 AM] Me: you shouldn't be, like i said you are very attractive
[03/08/2006 11:07 AM] Me: well, just think about that, i know everyone is different, but i'm a pretty outgoing person, i think that if you get along with someone well, and enjoy another persons company that's enough to try dating that person, i'm not suggesting that's what you do though, i'm not trying to be pushy at all, just letting you know what i am thinking and similarly what colin is thinking
[03/08/2006 11:07 AM] Christina Sanders: thanks, i was gonna say that i have never hung out with you guys and ever since monday night i have been hagning out with you two and just the way you guys acted around me... it was obvious for me
[03/08/2006 11:07 AM] Me: lol well, we enjoy being around you
[03/08/2006 11:07 AM] Christina Sanders: thx
[03/08/2006 11:07 AM] Me: so give that a though, and i can't wait to hang out again
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Christina Sanders: def will 
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Me: i am actually sorry we haven't hung out sooner, we are both fun people, i guess we have some catching up
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Christina Sanders: i guess we do
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Me: same goes for colin
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Christina Sanders: yes i bet
[03/08/2006 11:08 AM] Christina Sanders: well we def need to hang out again sometime this week

[03/09/2006 03:13 AM] Me: its hard for me to stay committed and focused on this other girl, we live really far away and we haven't really sealed the deal, so i guess i am not really helping the situation either.

[03/09/2006 03:15 AM] Christina Sanders: hey about long distance relationships
[03/09/2006 03:15 AM] Me: this other girl i am committed to, i guess i don't really see her that way
[03/09/2006 03:16 AM] Christina Sanders: the one i was in last semester was a long distance ... heck he was in boulder and i was here and i hadn't seen him since late june and we started "dating" so to speak late july early august

[03/09/2006 09:50 PM] Me: i know i know
[03/09/2006 09:50 PM] Me: i guess because i kind of encouraged him to make a move with you
[03/09/2006 09:50 PM] Me: i can hope that we always will be friends
[03/09/2006 09:50 PM] Me: want to make a deal?
[03/09/2006 09:51 PM] Me: i will have my mind made up by the end of spring break, if you are still available can i let you know then?

[03/09/2006 09:53 PM] Me: ok?
[03/09/2006 09:53 PM] Christina Sanders: sorry
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Christina Sanders: aim decided to quit on me
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Christina Sanders: here hold on
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Christina Sanders: So I had a terrible day. I didn’t get enough sleep to start, and my mind was… unfocused to say the least, all day long. My midterm I don’t remember. In band and horn ensemble I was completely gone. Tonight I spent more than an hour in the practice room and got no results, my mind is just out. I don’t know what to do except this. If it wasn’t obvious before, I do like you. It seemed to me the other night that you and Brian are becoming an item. Brian encouraged me to make a move so many times, now I guess I’m kinda jealous that he did. More than anything I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed in myself. One for not making a move. The other reason is more being pissed off than disappointed.
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Christina Sanders: I should’ve known that I didn’t have a shot with you from the start. I was foolish to think I was in the same league as you. Maybe just the prospect of being with an intelligent, funny, gorgeous, sweet, and playful, girl made me think I had a chance, I dunno why it would though. Either way I should be happy. Brian is a good guy. All the time you see the girls (don’t act as if u don’t know) that go out with assholes again and again. I should be happy that at least it’s a good guy this time. But, should be is the term. All in all, jealousy, disappointment, and definitely sadness. I apologize for throwing all of this all at you at once, as well as not in person. But were this in person, I probably would have just said goodnight, like every other time. 
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Christina Sanders: there that is what he sent to me
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Me: ok let my psychoanalyze it for a second
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Christina Sanders: ok
[03/09/2006 09:58 PM] Me: what do you think of it
[03/09/2006 09:59 PM] Christina Sanders: well...
[03/09/2006 10:03 PM] Christina Sanders: he abviously is telling me how he feels about the entire situation... but also if i am reading this correctly i think he is backing down from me and he is sorta glad that i am liking you  because he was talking about how girls always fall for jerks and luckily i found a good guy ... he seemed really bitter too 
[03/09/2006 10:04 PM] Me: yeah
[03/09/2006 10:05 PM] Me: well, tell me about your last boyfriend, what ended the relationship?
[03/09/2006 10:05 PM] Christina Sanders: well my last few relationships were wierd
[03/09/2006 10:05 PM] Christina Sanders: sit back and let me tell you
[03/09/2006 10:05 PM] Me: ok, i'm very excited, i might need popcorn
[03/09/2006 10:10 PM] Me: you type too much you'll get and error when you try to send it
[03/09/2006 10:11 PM] Christina Sanders: okay well my friend ryan and i met over the summer and kept in contact (he lives in co) and we got real close and by the end of july (even though we saw each other twice that summer and the last time was in late june) we were pretty much a couple (he never did ask me out, since it was a phone relationship... ) and got really close but as school started we started getting busy and we both got tired of the long distance, it got really frustrating ...
[03/09/2006 10:11 PM] Christina Sanders: we wanted to be together in the physical sense... the phone was just not enough
[03/09/2006 10:11 PM] Me: lol i don't blame him
[03/09/2006 10:13 PM] Christina Sanders: well i started hanging out with some guys (mainly ted from marching band) and he sorta got jealous mainly becuase ted could hang out with me and he couldn't and one day right after family day weekend he stopped talking to me and on facebook and myspace he changed it from "in a relationship" 
[03/09/2006 10:13 PM] Christina Sanders: so we didn't talk and while i was going through this... ted was there to take care of me and we closer and by band day... he kissed me and told me how much he liked me ... but here's the funny part
[03/09/2006 10:15 PM] Christina Sanders: over boa weekend... ryan came to visit because his old high school was competing so he could see his bro (who was dm) and me .... but right before he came i called and confessed what happend, he took it really well, but told me he wanted to see me...
[03/09/2006 10:16 PM] Christina Sanders: him and i had a blast over boa weekend, we did decided that the relationship wouldn't work out but wanted to stay good friends because we got so close... he's now like my brother.... but the story isn't over
[03/09/2006 10:17 PM] Me: wow this is pretty intense
[03/09/2006 10:17 PM] Christina Sanders: that weekend ted's old girlfriend was in town so they decided to start going out again......
[03/09/2006 10:17 PM] Christina Sanders: so here was i with a broken heart and mad at myself.....
[03/09/2006 10:17 PM] Me: awww
[03/09/2006 10:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i saw ryan a few times  due to him visiting his family in az (heck his cousin ashley is one of my best friends) and for some reason i kept trying to bring back the relationship, but ryan kept saying no and actually broke my heart one night by being a complete ass about the entire situation (however we are still friends and we have come to terms)
[03/09/2006 10:19 PM] Christina Sanders: wait i am not done...
[03/09/2006 10:19 PM] Me: wow dude my heart is breaking just hearing this story
[03/09/2006 10:20 PM] Christina Sanders: so the last half of the semester i was a total wreck trying to get over those two guys and while this was going on my friend ian and i were getting close
[03/09/2006 10:21 PM] Christina Sanders: and at the beginning of winter break we hung out and i will tell you i was sorta doing anything i could to be a realtionship again to fill the void and one night ian kissed me and a couple nights later he asked me out.... 
[03/09/2006 10:22 PM] Christina Sanders: a week later i broke up with him because, i knew from the start this relationship with ian was only to sorta get back at ryan and in some wierd way help me get over ryan and ted
[03/09/2006 10:22 PM] Christina Sanders: and i love ian so much.... but like a brother and i didn't want to risk losing him because i knew this relationship couldn't go anywhere
[03/09/2006 10:23 PM] Christina Sanders: he didn't talk to me for awhile but we  have worked things out and he still my friend
[03/09/2006 10:23 PM] Christina Sanders: just not as close and last time i went home.... he had a new girlfriend... 
[03/09/2006 10:24 PM] Christina Sanders: i have gone through alot but i can hoonestly say, it has helped me mature
[03/09/2006 10:25 PM] Christina Sanders: oh did i tell you that ryan was my first real relationship.... and i have only gone on really one date ... and this was a guy i knew my senior, but we just decided not to go out
[03/09/2006 10:26 PM] Me: wow
[03/09/2006 10:26 PM] Me: wow
[03/09/2006 10:26 PM] Me: that's a lot to take in
[03/09/2006 10:27 PM] Christina Sanders: i know, but i thought you should know
[03/09/2006 10:27 PM] Christina Sanders: i am kinda new at this game....
[03/09/2006 10:28 PM] Me: i try not to play games
[03/09/2006 10:28 PM] Me: i am always honest
[03/09/2006 10:28 PM] Me: you had some pretty bad experiences and i promise i will not add to that
[03/09/2006 10:28 PM] Christina Sanders: thx
[03/09/2006 10:29 PM] Christina Sanders: well i have been really nieve and to be honest for the longest time all i wanted was a kiss and didn't really pay attention to the part of being in a relationship
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Me: was your first kiss splediforous
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Me: ?
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Christina Sanders: well it was ted 
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Me: so you've never made out?
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Christina Sanders: and it was wow! i am just mad there was nothing really after it (relationship wise)
[03/09/2006 10:30 PM] Christina Sanders: yes i have made out...
[03/09/2006 10:31 PM] Christina Sanders: i feel awkward admiting that
[03/09/2006 10:32 PM] Me: making out is fun
[03/09/2006 10:33 PM] Christina Sanders: i will admit, it is quite enjoyable and everytime i have been kissed, it led to a make out
[03/09/2006 10:33 PM] Me: the thing is, i have know this girl since middle school, and shes the only friend i have stayed in touch with all these years, last winter break we hung out a few times while i was in ohio and we got along great. the problem is this, in the past we never talked online more then a week after i visited her, now we talk all the time.  at first i was skeptical of it going anywhere, i have always been attracted to her, and she knew that, but i am afraid she kind of jumped into the relationship, and i kind of fell into it.  i always new long distance relationships were hard, but i've already committed to her, and now i realize why they are so hard because my interest in her is fading fast.
[03/09/2006 10:34 PM] Me: there is me being honest
[03/09/2006 10:34 PM] Me: making out is fun
[03/09/2006 10:35 PM] Christina Sanders: well to be honest with you, so you know.... i just want this to be said up front... but making out is as far as i have gone or will ever go (at least until i am married)
[03/09/2006 10:36 PM] Me: good
[03/09/2006 10:37 PM] Christina Sanders: i made that pledge to myself and i do not intend to break it
[03/09/2006 10:37 PM] Me: that's good
[03/09/2006 10:37 PM] Me: i would never try to take something that a girl was not willing to give
[03/09/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: good to know...
[03/09/2006 10:38 PM] Christina Sanders: wow i like this honesty thing
[03/09/2006 10:38 PM] Me: yeah its fun isn't it?
[03/09/2006 10:39 PM] Christina Sanders: well it makes or breaks friendships and relationships
[03/09/2006 10:40 PM] Me: i'll be more honest, you are an incredible woman, you are everything jesus said, intelligent, beautiful, fun, playful, and you deserve and equally incredible guy, never forget that.  from what you told me its sounds like you had some rough relationships, don't let that discourage you, it does get better.
[03/09/2006 10:41 PM] Me: i know you are smart enough to find the right person
[03/09/2006 10:41 PM] Christina Sanders: i know
[03/09/2006 10:41 PM] Christina Sanders: thx
[03/09/2006 10:41 PM] Christina Sanders: i really appreciate that
[03/09/2006 10:42 PM] Me: any time
[03/09/2006 10:42 PM] Me: now to emotionally heal jesus
[03/09/2006 10:42 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[03/09/2006 10:43 PM] Christina Sanders: hey i just want to say this again... i will be behind you in whatever decison you make... i am really glad i ran into you monday night, in the past few days you have become a good friend
[03/09/2006 10:44 PM] Me: yes, you are a wonderful friend too
[03/09/2006 10:44 PM] Me: but we should both agree that we are very flirtatious people
[03/09/2006 10:44 PM] Me: :-D
[03/09/2006 10:45 PM] Christina Sanders: it is quite funny how one little decison can change your life quite quickly... for me, it all started by deciding to not to go back to my room and to head over to java ... the rest is history
[03/09/2006 10:45 PM] Me: yeah weird
[03/09/2006 10:45 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah, i agree, and i do have to say you are quite the flirt
[03/09/2006 10:45 PM] Me: :-D
[03/09/2006 10:45 PM] Me: payback for the other day
[03/09/2006 10:46 PM] Christina Sanders: but hey flirting is so much fun
[03/09/2006 10:46 PM] Christina Sanders: payback for what?
[03/09/2006 10:46 PM] Me: flirting with me so much wednesday night
[03/09/2006 10:46 PM] Me: i wasn't very responsive
[03/09/2006 10:47 PM] Christina Sanders: oh.... yeah, true
[03/09/2006 10:48 PM] Me: so i made up for it tonight
[03/09/2006 10:48 PM] Me: :-D
[03/09/2006 10:48 PM] Christina Sanders: fine with me ;)
[03/09/2006 10:49 PM] Me: yeah you have really nice legs
[03/09/2006 10:49 PM] Me: *grins*
[03/09/2006 10:49 PM] Christina Sanders: wow...... no one has ever said that to me
[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] Me: was i too honest?
[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] Me: whats your e-mail address?
[03/09/2006 10:50 PM] Christina Sanders: (Link: mailto:music4life007@hotmail.com)music4life007@hotmail.com

[03/09/2006 10:51 PM] Me: well earlier when i said you were attractive, i meant all of you, including your appearance
[03/09/2006 10:53 PM] Me: see isn't honesty fun?
[03/09/2006 10:53 PM] Christina Sanders: it is
[03/09/2006 10:53 PM] Me: i believe if people were move honest with their feelings for others, there would be a lot stronger relationships
[03/09/2006 10:53 PM] Christina Sanders: k i'll be honest.... your eyes is what got in the first place
[03/09/2006 10:53 PM] Me: really?
[03/09/2006 10:54 PM] Me: so i guess what you "play the game" its not always honest, that's why i don't like to play the game
[03/09/2006 10:54 PM] Me: *when
[03/09/2006 10:54 PM] Me: i am always honest
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Christina Sanders: well i want to tell you this
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Christina Sanders: when i first met you sometime last semester i remember saying to myself he's really cute, attractive...etc
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Me: really?
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Me: why didn't you say anything?!
[03/09/2006 10:55 PM] Christina Sanders: but it was awkard mainly cuz what was going on in my life so i never went any further with this
[03/09/2006 10:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: i would have treated you better
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] Me: sorry that's kind of awkward
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] Christina Sanders: i'll just never forget the first time i talked to you
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] Me: really?
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] Christina Sanders: you sent me an im saying "do you want to buy some webspace"
[03/09/2006 10:58 PM] Me: lol

[03/09/2006 11:02 PM] Christina Sanders: and to be honest i was kinda freaked out, but i tried to be poliet about it... you also got to understand... last semester was overwhelming, i came from a tiny school and all the sudden i was thrown into a 140 piece band and meeting all those people... kinda made me freak out
[03/09/2006 11:02 PM] Me: lol sorry about that, i can be quite strange
[03/09/2006 11:03 PM] Christina Sanders: don't worry about it, i am the same way

[03/09/2006 11:26 PM] Me: what?

[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Me: i don't
[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Me: i think they are dull
[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Me: i like your smile
[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Me: you never stop smiling
[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Me: that's awesome
[03/09/2006 11:27 PM] Christina Sanders: that's what ppl say
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Me: its cute
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Christina Sanders: it's curse i have had since i was born with
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Christina Sanders: heck i smile at funerals... it's pathetic
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Me: really?
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Me: why is it a curse?
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Christina Sanders: well i dunno, it takes me alot to cry
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Christina Sanders: and i hate that
[03/09/2006 11:28 PM] Christina Sanders: because something sad happens and all that really happens is ..."oh that's horrible" and that is pretty much it
[03/09/2006 11:29 PM] Me: yeah
[03/09/2006 11:29 PM] Christina Sanders: it has to be something that sorta cuts me deep in order to cry
[03/09/2006 11:29 PM] Me: well, i hope i never see that smile leave your face
[03/09/2006 11:29 PM] Christina Sanders: for example last semester, ryan has made me cry more than any of my friends
[03/09/2006 11:29 PM] Me: aww that's terrible
[03/09/2006 11:30 PM] Christina Sanders: my parents are the only ppl that have made me cry more (only due to punishments blah blah)
[03/09/2006 11:30 PM] Me: yeah
[03/09/2006 11:31 PM] Christina Sanders: heck i never cried at the movies until i saw return of the king
[03/09/2006 11:31 PM] Me: really?
[03/09/2006 11:31 PM] Me: that's so cute, i love that movie
[03/09/2006 11:32 PM] Christina Sanders: and heck i only welled up.. the only movies i can honestly saw i have cried at is ladder 49 and Rent

[03/09/2006 11:33 PM] Christina Sanders: hmmmm... well saturday after noon i already promised to hang out with my friend alicia
[03/09/2006 11:33 PM] Me: how about sunday?
[03/09/2006 11:34 PM] Me: "[03/09/2006 11:32 PM] Keifer Street: I told her that you really wanted to see her in a bathing suit, but it backfired... she said she would  LOVE to oblidge
 [03/09/2006 11:33 PM] Keifer Street: She told me (honestly) that she would be willing to show her her bikkini" is that true?
[03/09/2006 11:34 PM] Christina Sanders: haa haa haa haa haaa haaa haa haa haa haa haa haa
[03/09/2006 11:34 PM] Christina Sanders: oh my.... that was my greatest one yet
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Christina Sanders: well to be honest, let me work on my tan first because i am so stinking white i could blind someone
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Me: lol i don't care, its sounds great, lets kind a hottub
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Me: lol
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Me: :-D
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Christina Sanders: haa haa... wow i still can't believe i said that
[03/09/2006 11:35 PM] Me: why?
[03/09/2006 11:36 PM] Christina Sanders: well to be honest normally if a guy said that to me i would either freak out or probably never talk to him again
[03/09/2006 11:36 PM] Christina Sanders: and looking back it is a little awkward
[03/09/2006 11:36 PM] Me: lol sorry
[03/09/2006 11:36 PM] Christina Sanders: don't worry about it
[03/09/2006 11:40 PM] Me: think of it this way, we have a comfortable enough friendship so far that it doesn't matter, at least you have an incredible body that guys would find attractive
[03/09/2006 11:41 PM] Christina Sanders: thx, it's kinda wierd i am still getting used to it because i never really had curves and was a little overweight frosh through junior year
[03/09/2006 11:41 PM] Christina Sanders: then my senior year i lost weight, and sorta how do i say this finally really became feminine?
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Me: that's cute, take care of those curves you don't want to get fat like me
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Me: :-D
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: oh my brian
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: you are not fat
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Me: lol i know
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: at all
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: k good
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Me: my metabolism is amazing
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Me: i loves it
[03/09/2006 11:42 PM] Christina Sanders: mine too, 
[03/09/2006 11:43 PM] Me: you do have a really cute body
[03/09/2006 11:43 PM] Me: but it wouldn't matter if it wasn't accompanied by an even better personality
[03/09/2006 11:43 PM] Christina Sanders: man it was crazy last semester... when i first moved here to nau, i started eating alot and i was afraid that i gained the freshman 15 in 2 mnths of being here ....  and when i went home in oct... the first thing my mom said to me..."did you lose weight"
[03/09/2006 11:44 PM] Christina Sanders: thx... but you do have to admit... if it wasn't for my looks.... you probably wouldn't have really been able to get to know we as you have
[03/09/2006 11:44 PM] Me: nah dude
[03/09/2006 11:44 PM] Me: you're cute, but you're also really fun
[03/09/2006 11:45 PM] Me: i like surrounding myself with beautiful people, i would have invited you over to hang out anyways
[03/09/2006 11:45 PM] Christina Sanders: thx
[03/09/2006 11:45 PM] Me: of course
[03/09/2006 11:45 PM] Christina Sanders: well while we are on that subject... you aint too shabby yourself
[03/09/2006 11:46 PM] Christina Sanders: :)
[03/09/2006 11:46 PM] Me: aww thanks
[03/09/2006 11:46 PM] Me: i could work out some
[03/09/2006 11:46 PM] Me: i run kinda fast, but i need more upper body strength
[03/09/2006 11:46 PM] Me: i guess i'm just lazy is all
[03/09/2006 11:47 PM] Christina Sanders: i know how that goes... i am so out of shape... i was in good shape last semester during band... but since then, i have gotten really lazy
[03/09/2006 11:47 PM] Me: all i have to show off is my golfball arm muscle, its define but i'm so think that its small, i should work out more
[03/09/2006 11:47 PM] Christina Sanders:  haa haa haa
[03/09/2006 11:48 PM] Me: i guess before i have always been a pretty small person, but now that i am bigger i need to work on my muscles to match
[03/09/2006 11:48 PM] Christina Sanders: oh, so you have gotten taller then right?
[03/09/2006 11:49 PM] Me: yeah i used to be tiny, so i was lazy
[03/09/2006 11:49 PM] Me: but i've always been able to outrun people when i'm being chased, i used to get beat up freshman year
[03/09/2006 11:49 PM] Me: it was funny
[03/09/2006 11:49 PM] Christina Sanders: wow...
[03/09/2006 11:50 PM] Christina Sanders: i seriously never really got attention until my junior year... but of course that was when i started acting and dressing more like a girl
[03/09/2006 11:50 PM] Me: lol wow, well i am glad you decided to start
[03/09/2006 11:51 PM] Christina Sanders: well i have always been trying to find my own style (so to speak) that i liked and it was me being me.... and it never really happend until my junior year... i got a lot of influences from my little freshman who kinda helped me become more of a girl
[03/09/2006 11:51 PM] Christina Sanders: then by my senior year... well that is history!!! lol
[03/09/2006 11:52 PM] Me: aww
[03/09/2006 11:53 PM] Christina Sanders: apprently my junior year almost every freshman boy had a crush on me... but since i wasn't quite there yet no one really made a move and i found out that my friend danielle told all of them that i wasn't into dating!!!!!!
[03/09/2006 11:54 PM] Me: would you really have wanted to date freshman guys? they're so immature!  you don't seen like that kind of person
[03/09/2006 11:55 PM] Christina Sanders: i know 
[03/09/2006 11:55 PM] Christina Sanders: looking back i am glad...
[03/09/2006 11:55 PM] Me: yeah, good thing you didn't try that
[03/09/2006 11:55 PM] Christina Sanders: well one of those boys was Ian...., they guy i temporarily dated over winter break
[03/09/2006 11:55 PM] Me: then again doesn't sound like your other relationships were that mature either
[03/09/2006 11:56 PM] Christina Sanders: well i never really had experience
[03/09/2006 11:56 PM] Christina Sanders: but now that i have...
[03/09/2006 11:56 PM] Me: yeah that's good
[03/09/2006 11:57 PM] Christina Sanders: i just hope i dont make the mistakes i made
[03/09/2006 11:58 PM] Me: my first girlfriend dumped me for my best friend, she told me she never really wanted to be with me, she was just curious.  we were each other's first kiss, not she hates me.  whenever i talk to her she always fights with me even though i am always nice to her.  now i am living with her boyfriend my best friend Eric since freshman year.  we were never really friends, i guess i just didn't have very good friends.  now i am moving out because i just can't take it anymore.  theres my highschool life in a paragraph.
[03/09/2006 11:58 PM] Christina Sanders: Wow!!!
[03/09/2006 11:59 PM] Me: but you never really asked
[03/10/2006 12:00 AM] Christina Sanders: well to be honest i never know if ppl want me to know so i kinda wait for them to tell me
[03/10/2006 12:00 AM] Christina Sanders: so it doesn't seem like i am prying
[03/10/2006 12:00 AM] Me: i had one other girlfriend a year later it only lasted about a month, i didn't really like her, she was just a rebound as bad as that sounds.  fortunately for me, i am smart enough to learn from not only my own but everyone elses mistakes too, now i have the obligation to comfort all of my emotionally distraught friends
[03/10/2006 12:01 AM] Christina Sanders: wow, hey at least you have the experience to live off of
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Me: since i've been here i've had 3 one nighters, 1 with 2 girls at the same time, then i turned christian and i completely regret the one night stands, i tried to fill an empty void with empty relationships, but i'm still a virgin so its all just a learning experience
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Me: guess you don't need to pry
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Christina Sanders: you're christian? wow that is soo awesome
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Christina Sanders: my problem is i haven't been able to find someone
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Me: are you?
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah i am
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Me: yeah
[03/10/2006 12:02 AM] Christina Sanders: i just am not to open about it
[03/10/2006 12:03 AM] Christina Sanders: bad habit of mine
[03/10/2006 12:03 AM] Christina Sanders: but working on it
[03/10/2006 12:03 AM] Me: keifer was kind of my light in a dark place, he opened my eyes to god and i have really developed a relationship with him, now i just have to break some old habits and it will all be good
[03/10/2006 12:04 AM] Me: no more one nighters for me
[03/10/2006 12:04 AM] Christina Sanders: wow that is soo good to hear... i have had problems because the ppl i have been surronded with aren't christian  really 
[03/10/2006 12:04 AM] Christina Sanders: but i didn't find a friend kaity and she's taking me to church on sunday... which i am so excited about
[03/10/2006 12:04 AM] Me: well we are all christian, me keifer, richard
[03/10/2006 12:05 AM] Me: which church?
[03/10/2006 12:05 AM] Christina Sanders: man i can't remember the name
[03/10/2006 12:05 AM] Christina Sanders: one sec lemme find out
[03/10/2006 12:05 AM] Me: keifer and i go to vintage, its a really quaint little group we would love for you to join us
[03/10/2006 12:05 AM] Me: so maybe if we hang out sunday and watch movies we can go to church afterwards
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Christina Sanders: well it is north point fellowship and it is in the morning
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Christina Sanders: then i have meetings in evening
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Me: ew i hate morning practice
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Me: meetings?
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Christina Sanders: oh i am in tau beta sigma if you didn't know
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Christina Sanders: the band sorority
[03/10/2006 12:07 AM] Christina Sanders: and we have out meetings sunday evening
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Me: oh
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Christina Sanders: so that's why
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Me: i guess we can't watch movies this weekend then
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Christina Sanders: well what are you doing tomorrow
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Me: fixing your computer
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Me: i guess we could do it then
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Christina Sanders: after that?
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Me: nothing
[03/10/2006 12:08 AM] Christina Sanders: k
[03/10/2006 12:09 AM] Christina Sanders: good... then
[03/10/2006 12:09 AM] Christina Sanders: oh i just want to say something real quick
[03/10/2006 12:09 AM] Me: yeah/
[03/10/2006 12:09 AM] Me: ?
[03/10/2006 12:11 AM] Christina Sanders: when i heard that you are christian, i made me smile and seriously made my week... another big reason why my other relationships didn't really work out was because the guys were either not christian or didn't really care and my dad has always told me that when i am in a relationship with a man, he needs to be christian... you know the verse "do not be unequally yoked" i have tried to live off that ... it's hard... but now you have come along
[03/10/2006 12:11 AM] Christina Sanders: wait... i am getting way too far ahead of myself
[03/10/2006 12:11 AM] Christina Sanders: but i wanted you to know that
[03/10/2006 12:12 AM] Me: that's wonderful
[03/10/2006 12:13 AM] Me: i agree, christianity requires a lot of strong morals
[03/10/2006 12:14 AM] Me: i an fairly new to christianity, but i am adapting well, i was raised catholic but i never really got into it
[03/10/2006 12:15 AM] Me: there are a few verses in the bible that explain how difficult marrying outside christianity would be, so i can understand why that even in dating relationships that should always be a concern
[03/10/2006 12:16 AM] Christina Sanders: well i have been a christian since 4th grade but since i have been here.... i haven't been the best.... last semester i sorta waved (but never turned my back on God) and i was going through alot especially beginning of this semester then i went home a couple weeks ago and that helped me out so much, being at my old church and remembering that i have friends back home who support me...
[03/10/2006 12:17 AM] Christina Sanders: and since then i am doing my best to get back on track... i haven't read my bible as much, but i always do my best to pray, and i am re-reading a book i have had for a while on developing love relationships in God's eyes
[03/10/2006 12:17 AM] Me: yeah the catholic church is different in so many ways, i never really felt apart of it, so i did turn my back on god.  but since being christian i have felt this incredible warmth in my heart knowing that god will be there for me
[03/10/2006 12:17 AM] Christina Sanders: yeah... that is what has kept me going this year 
[03/10/2006 12:18 AM] Christina Sanders: even though i turn my back on him... He will always be there
[03/10/2006 12:18 AM] Christina Sanders: hey... i just realized what time it is.... i need to hit the hay
[03/10/2006 12:18 AM] Me: yeah so i have really been working on my relationship with him and reading the bible, i just wish these old habits were easier to break
[03/10/2006 12:18 AM] Christina Sanders: but i really really really (times a bazillion) enjoyed myself today
[03/10/2006 12:18 AM] Me: yeah i wish i could, i still have to study CS
[03/10/2006 12:19 AM] Me: that's good, i'm glad you had fun
[03/10/2006 12:19 AM] Christina Sanders: thx again for tonite
[03/10/2006 12:19 AM] Me: of course

[03/15/2006 03:19 PM] Christina Sanders: Matt: I wanted to tell you how idsappointed I am in your decisions. I now look down on you instead of as an equal.  I thought that I knew you better but i guess I was wrong.
[03/15/2006 03:20 PM] Me: what the hell?
[03/15/2006 03:21 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah he told me he found out from someone else
[03/15/2006 03:21 PM] Christina Sanders: and i am trying to explain it to him, but I don't know what to say
[03/15/2006 03:22 PM] Christina Sanders: heck, i heard from Alex that Lauren thinks we are taking this way too fast and i dunno seems that everyone is frowning on me for going after you
[03/15/2006 03:22 PM] Me: why would they be frowning on you?
[03/15/2006 03:23 PM] Me: tell you what, i decided i am going to tell Amy now that her and I should be friends so if she still comes out it will be completely friendly
[03/15/2006 03:24 PM] Me: do you think that would change their opinion of our relationship
[03/15/2006 03:25 PM] Christina Sanders: okay i just told matt that you are in a dead end relationship yadda yadda and that you chose me over her and matt just replied that I am still fooling around and that it is wrong!
[03/15/2006 03:26 PM] Me: what?
[03/15/2006 03:26 PM] Me: that's crazy

[04/06/2006 12:43 AM] Me: please ask
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Christina Sanders: what is your opinion on love
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Christina Sanders: like do you believe in love at first sight
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Christina Sanders: or it is something that sinks into you
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Me: well, i believe that it is possible to love all of your friends
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Christina Sanders: i mean romantically
[04/06/2006 12:44 AM] Christina Sanders: when it comes to the girl in your life
[04/06/2006 12:45 AM] Me: i guess it is something that sink in, but you have to be careful with the word because there are different levels of love
[04/06/2006 12:46 AM] Me: what do you think?
[04/06/2006 12:48 AM] Christina Sanders: not sure
[04/06/2006 12:48 AM] Christina Sanders: but to be honest
[04/06/2006 12:48 AM] Christina Sanders: i don't think it is possible for love at first sight
[04/06/2006 12:50 AM] Christina Sanders: because love in the romantic guy love girl sense
[04/06/2006 12:50 AM] Christina Sanders: love is an unconditional feeling for a certain someone
[04/06/2006 12:50 AM] Christina Sanders: you just want to be with them and adore everything about them
[04/06/2006 12:50 AM] Christina Sanders: and how can you get to that point without knowning that person and coming close to them?
[04/06/2006 12:51 AM] Me: yeah
[04/06/2006 12:52 AM] Me: i guess you would have to believe in soul mates
[04/06/2006 12:56 AM] Christina Sanders: i sorta do
[04/06/2006 12:56 AM] Christina Sanders: i think God made someone just for you
[04/06/2006 12:57 AM] Me: yeah
[04/06/2006 12:57 AM] Me: i don't know about soul mates because that's like a perfect match
[04/06/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: how about imperfect match
[04/06/2006 12:57 AM] Christina Sanders: ;)
[04/06/2006 12:57 AM] Me: but i believe there is someone that you match well with
[04/06/2006 12:58 AM] Christina Sanders: well i don't think it can be a perfect match because nothing on earth is perfect
[04/06/2006 12:58 AM] Christina Sanders: but there's a match made for you
[04/06/2006 12:58 AM] Christina Sanders: that you are compatible with
[04/06/2006 12:59 AM] Me: yeah
[04/06/2006 12:59 AM] Christina Sanders: and along the road
[04/06/2006 12:59 AM] Christina Sanders: you will meet ppl that you get along with
[04/06/2006 12:59 AM] Christina Sanders: and you think that they might be that one person
[04/06/2006 01:00 AM] Christina Sanders: and then after trials and tribulations
[04/06/2006 01:00 AM] Christina Sanders: you find out over time who you are and what you want and need out of your other half
[04/06/2006 01:00 AM] Christina Sanders: so that helps you find that person
[04/06/2006 01:00 AM] Christina Sanders: and then one day
[04/06/2006 01:00 AM] Christina Sanders: bam
[04/06/2006 01:01 AM] Me: yeah
[04/06/2006 01:01 AM] Christina Sanders: that's what i belive
[04/06/2006 01:02 AM] Me: yeah
[04/06/2006 01:02 AM] Christina Sanders: anyways
[04/06/2006 01:02 AM] Christina Sanders: have you fallen in love before?
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Me: not sure
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Me: i guess you can't ever really be sure
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Christina Sanders: i know
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Me: because if you do, then what do you have to compare it to?
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Christina Sanders: exactly
[04/06/2006 01:03 AM] Christina Sanders: well sometimes love can be confused for lust
[04/06/2006 01:04 AM] Me: yes very true
[04/06/2006 01:05 AM] Me: but when you do find someone compatible although you can never really be sure there isn't someone better out there for you, all that really matters is your relationship with that person at that moment
[04/06/2006 01:05 AM] Me: so i guess accepting that would be love

[05/20/2006 11:10 PM] Christina Sanders: i want to keep it down to get rid of the tempation
[05/20/2006 11:11 PM] Christina Sanders: don't get me wrong i love the orgasms
[05/20/2006 11:11 PM] Christina Sanders: but right nw

[05/20/2006 11:11 PM] Me: what ever you think is right
[05/20/2006 11:11 PM] Me: i'm not saying i disagree, but you are starting to sound like keifer
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Me: what i mean is the "getting rid of temptation"
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: ....
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: i am sorry
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: oh

[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: well i know that i wouldn't do it anyway
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Me: there will always be temptation

[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: yes there will be
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: but what i am trying to say is 
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Me: i just thought that was a happy medium
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Me: and alternative to sex
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Me: but still satisfying
[05/20/2006 11:13 PM] Christina Sanders: yes true true

[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Christina Sanders: believe me i want to
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Christina Sanders: but i don't think it is the right thing
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Me: then i will not ask you for it, i will support your descision
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Christina Sanders: it is so hard to say that
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Me: because you are worth waiting for
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Me: and i will have to have patients
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Christina Sanders: i really want us to last
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Me: *patience
[05/20/2006 11:14 PM] Christina Sanders: and i think saving that will be good

[05/20/2006 11:15 PM] Me: i just have to stay away from the neck
[05/20/2006 11:15 PM] Me: before i didn't know how serious you were about the limits you made
[05/20/2006 11:16 PM] Me: i guess i pressured you a little, and i hope you can forgive me
[05/20/2006 11:16 PM] Christina Sanders: i do, i could have easily said no myself but i fell into it
[05/20/2006 11:16 PM] Me: fell into it
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Christina Sanders: umm not the right wordage
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Me: no its fine
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Me: i understand
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Christina Sanders: i mean i went along without saying anything
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Christina Sanders: heck i did it wilingly
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Christina Sanders: i love you so much and i want our relationship to last a long time
[05/20/2006 11:17 PM] Christina Sanders: and i feel this is the best thing to do
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: heck i will still make out with you
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: and you can kiss me wherever 
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: just no hickies
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: for now at least
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: :)
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Me: ok
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Me: the last night you spent with me was hard for me
[05/20/2006 11:18 PM] Christina Sanders: why?
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Me: you always got me so worked up, then there was nothing, you turned away from me to go to sleep
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Christina Sanders: I really am sorry
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Christina Sanders: i iwas just wanting to be in your arms
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Me: that is why i moved my hands away from you, i thought you felt guilty for what we do
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Christina Sanders: annd fall asleep in my arms
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Christina Sanders: *your arms
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Christina Sanders: oh...
[05/20/2006 11:19 PM] Me: guys are so different from girls though
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Christina Sanders: true dat
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Me: you can only make out and feel each other up for so long before they turn blue
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Me: its a terrible flaw in the design
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Christina Sanders: yeah to be honest, i was getting tired of that because i felt like that was all we did... making eachother orgasm
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Christina Sanders: and i didn't want our relationship to revolve around it
[05/20/2006 11:20 PM] Me: where guys have the animalistic desire to be sexually active all the time, woman daydream about marriage and falling asleep in each others arms
[05/20/2006 11:21 PM] Christina Sanders: ... yeah
[05/20/2006 11:21 PM] Christina Sanders: well believe me
[05/20/2006 11:21 PM] Christina Sanders: i have those "animalistic" dreams to
[05/20/2006 11:21 PM] Christina Sanders: but I try to control myself
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Me: so that is why i told you our best nights together are when we talk and tell each other about ourselves, or when we do mess around a little, but when it is just in between it hurts
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: i know
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Me: i wanted us to be used to each others bodies
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: well those are things we will work on
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: we have only been dating for a little over 2 months
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: we have time
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Me: so i didn't get a boner every damn time you rubbed up against me
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: rememvber
[05/20/2006 11:22 PM] Christina Sanders: we have time
[05/20/2006 11:23 PM] Christina Sanders: what??
[05/20/2006 11:23 PM] Christina Sanders: i am confused
