[04/03/2005 01:35 AM] *** Auto-response sent to Eric S: It's that feeling you have had all your life. That feeling that something was wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me. But what is it?
[04/03/2005 01:35 AM] *** Auto-response from Eric S: She said, "why don't we both just sleep on it tonight"  
 And I believe, in the morning  
 you'll begin to see the light  
 And then she kissed me  
 and I realized she probably was right  
  
 There must be fifty ways to leave your lover... 
  
  
 at work until somewhere between 8:30-9:30 depending on who im closing with.
