[01/14/2005 01:19 PM] WG Wise Master: :'(
[01/14/2005 01:19 PM] WG Wise Master: All I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
 I like watchin' the puddles gather rain  
 and all I can do is just pour some tea for two  
 and speak my point of view  
 but it's not sane, It's not sane  
 I just want some one to say to me  
 i'll always be there when you wake  
 ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today  
 so stay with me and I'll have it made  
 and I don't understand why I sleep all day  
 and I start to complain that there's no rain  
 and all I can do is read a book to stay awake  
 and it rips my life away, but it's a great escape  
 escape......escape......escape......  
 all I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
 ya don't like my point of view  
 ya think I'm insane  
 its not sane......it's not sane 
[01/14/2005 01:21 PM] WG Wise Master: I feel a hunger 
  
 It's a hunger that tries to keep a man awake at night. 
 Are you the answer? 
 I shouldn't wonder when I feel you whet my appetite 
  
 With all the power you're releasing 
  
 It isn't safe to walk the city streets a 
 Anticipation is running through me 
  
 Let's find the key and turn this engine on. 
  
 I can feel you breathe 
 I can feel your heartbeat faster. 
 Take me home tonight! 
 I don't want to let you go till you see the light! 
 Take me home tonight! 
 Listen honey 
 iust like Ronnie sang: Be my little baby! 
  
 I get frightened in all this darkness 
  
 I get nightmares 
 I hate to sleep alone 
 I need some company 
  
 A guardian angel to keep me warm when the cold winds blow! 
  
 I can feel you breathe 
 I can feel your heartbeat faster. . . . 
 Be my little baby! 
  
 Just like Ronnie sang 
 I say 
 just like Ronnie sang: 
 Be my little baby 
 baby 
 my darling! 
 I feel a hunger 
 it's a hunger! 
  
 Take me home tonight!... 
 Take me home tonight!... 
 Take me home tonight!...

[03/24/2005 09:06 PM] Me: but we couldn't get it inflated
[03/24/2005 09:06 PM] Me: they had to take it to a Mexican gas station'
[03/24/2005 09:07 PM] Me: before that we got it stuck in the sand
[03/24/2005 09:07 PM] Me: and it wouldn't even start
[03/24/2005 09:07 PM] Me: it pissed me off, i had to walk like 3 miles to get help
[03/24/2005 09:07 PM] Me: and they brought the bigger shit to pull it out
[03/24/2005 09:08 PM] Me: and there were buzzards circling me
[03/24/2005 09:08 PM] Me: they thought i was gonna die
[03/24/2005 09:08 PM] Me: and the last time we fucked it up was the best

[03/24/2005 09:08 PM] Me: and forgot to record it
[03/24/2005 09:08 PM] Me: Daniel got out infront of the jump and i drove, i told Scott to get out too, but he stayed in
[03/24/2005 09:09 PM] Me: so when we went off the jump he hit his head on the bar and couldn't remember the jump at all
[03/24/2005 09:09 PM] Me: i laughed
[03/24/2005 09:09 PM] Me: we went really high
[03/24/2005 09:09 PM] Me: and the steering wasn't working right after that

[03/31/2005 11:18 PM] Chelsea: i said dont say anything about playboy
[03/31/2005 11:18 PM] Me: you don't want to be like a business major and become a secretary like most beautiful women have been at least once

[03/31/2005 11:20 PM] Me: you should have tried playboy at least, what is the harm in that? you would have made lots of money and would have been able to quit any time, by then you would have "real" modeling companies chasing after you
[03/31/2005 11:20 PM] Chelsea: that about it
[03/31/2005 11:20 PM] Chelsea: i just told you

 the Shiraz fruit covers more vineyard than any other varietal in Australia and it’s served its time in Aussie soil since the 19th century. This grape supplies an array of sexy, peppery reds, varying from light and fruity styles to big, bold, well-aging ones.

[05/06/2005 01:17 PM] Me: not anymore then he usually is
[05/06/2005 01:18 PM] Me: i am just wondering not trying to attack you

[05/06/2005 01:18 PM] Chelsea: did he say anything to you?

[05/06/2005 01:22 PM] Chelsea: ill never understand him. i yelled at him once about how he like blew you off one day and he said it was cuz you were jerk to him once like.. a long freakin time ago or something

[05/06/2005 01:27 PM] Chelsea: see part of me is so irritated with him and the other part of me feels bad, because his self esteem is so low that he folds so easily by peer pressure
[05/06/2005 01:28 PM] Me: ya
[05/06/2005 01:37 PM] Me: i don't want you to defend me

[06/01/2005 11:19 PM] Chelsea: lolol
[06/01/2005 11:19 PM] Me: me too its still funny though
[06/01/2005 11:20 PM] Me: this one is so true
[06/01/2005 11:20 PM] Me: A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

[06/01/2005 11:41 PM] Chelsea: alright
[06/01/2005 11:41 PM] Chelsea: ponder on this
[06/01/2005 11:41 PM] Chelsea: I feel like someone else 
 Someone I've never been. 
 You look different as well, 
 Like a whole new man. 
 And we have found each other 
 Some where in between a constant and change 
 We lay on the smooth, pavement and 
 Gaze into each other's eyes. 
 For a moment, I swear I can feel you 
 Running within my blood, 
 A reminder of what once 
 Was a familiar feeling. 
 But what is now a tease to my soul. 
 It is so quiet. 
 Has time stopped for us? 
 No, but it has quite possibly betrayed us, 
 And sped up. 
 I feel a tapping on my shoulder. 
 Mother earth is telling me this isn't right, 
 But I'm not listening to what she has to say. 
 The summer storm pulses upon our bodies 
 Like the earths heartbeat. 
 You pull me close and with a smile, 
 Give me a kiss that is 
 So nostalgic and forbidden, 
 That it has to be right. 
 Mother Nature claims defeat 
 And ceases. 
 All is quiet once more, 
 Except for the butterflies 
 Fluttering within me. 
 We lay there, looking so used 
 I glance over, and in the puddle next to me, 
 I see my past. 
 I see my lies and failures 
 They stare back through the reflection, 
 But I do not look back, 
 I have been cleansed of regret 
 And never again will accept the guilty feelings of my past 
 I feel your masculine hand slide across my silky flesh 
 And hug me around the waist, claiming me once again 
 Forever yours.
