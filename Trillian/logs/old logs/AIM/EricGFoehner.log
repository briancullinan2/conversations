[02/08/2004 10:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know, but she wants it
[02/08/2004 10:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: i would ask her, but if it ever comes up in a conversation, milk it
[02/08/2004 10:18 PM] EricGFoehner: milk it? im afraid im not totally familiar with that expression
[02/08/2004 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[02/08/2004 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: it means get everything out of it that you can

[02/08/2004 10:20 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[02/08/2004 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: because you wouldn't leave milk in a cow if you were going to milk it, you would milk it all out, not half of it
[02/08/2004 10:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: so that you can eat lucky charms with milk when the sun rises

[02/08/2004 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: Whenever I get really turned on, my chest becomes hot with blotchy red spots. Is this a problem or something to be alarmed about? They fade away after orgasm. 
  
 this is called a "sex flush," something about 25% of males may experience during high states of arousal, usually occurring on the torso above the waist, and sometimes extending to the face.

[05/08/2004 03:43 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[05/08/2004 03:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: the only thing more important then the wine, is the girl you're drinking it with

[06/08/2004 12:30 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, damn plastic things 
[06/08/2004 12:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: when i become rich and famous ill design my own so that i can keep every part of my room really clean because of my obsessive compulsiveness
[06/08/2004 12:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'll be able to remotely control which side is plastic by using my computer
[06/08/2004 12:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'll put and RF in my rolly chair so when i roll the next square infront of my will change to plastic
[06/08/2004 12:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then back again when i turn my back to that area
[06/08/2004 12:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: that would be so awesome

[16/08/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: we could just trade out media
[16/08/2004 03:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: or i could set up a home server and you could access my hard drive any time
[16/08/2004 03:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: since you are the host of your connection it would be even faster for you to download and be a server

 I fell into a burnin’ ring of fire -- 
 I went down, down, down 
 and the flames went higher, 
 and it burns, burn, burns, 
 the ring of fir, the ring of fire. 
  
 the taste of love is sweet 
 when hearts like ours meet. 
 I fell for you like a child -- 
 oh, but the fire ran wild. 
  
 I fell into a burnin’ ring of fire -- 
 I went down, down, down 
 and the flames went higher, 
 and it burns, burn, burns, 
 the ring of fir, the ring of fire.

[21/08/2004 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: how do you do this
[21/08/2004 10:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: i tried to tell you
[21/08/2004 10:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: you weren't interested
[21/08/2004 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: what
[21/08/2004 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: when
[21/08/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: when we talked about sharing south park
[21/08/2004 10:15 PM] EricGFoehner: i didn't say i wasn't interested 
[21/08/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[21/08/2004 10:16 PM] EricGFoehner: what happens if you get caught 
[21/08/2004 10:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: by who?
[21/08/2004 10:18 PM] EricGFoehner: anyone with a gun
[21/08/2004 10:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[21/08/2004 10:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: the server is in australia, it is legal for them to steal US media and share it
[21/08/2004 10:19 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[21/08/2004 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: so yeah there are always risks, just think of it as extended trial periods, or stuff they don't let you buy anyways
[21/08/2004 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can't buy porn until we are 18, but we can download it
[21/08/2004 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: and that movie i downloaded was a promotional movie
[21/08/2004 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: promoting me to buy the real version, which i will
[21/08/2004 10:20 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[21/08/2004 10:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: and for south park, they don't sell half the episodes, because they are dumbasses, if they did we would buy the whole collection, but they only want to sell 1 -4 now where is the fun in that?
[21/08/2004 10:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: see?
[21/08/2004 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[21/08/2004 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: so its their own damn fault
[21/08/2004 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah it is
[21/08/2004 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: besides the US already has stuff to worry about like LimeWire or Kaaza
[21/08/2004 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: they don't need to go all the way to australia to stop stolen content from spreading
[21/08/2004 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: the government seems to be more interested in other countries then our own though
[21/08/2004 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: not to mention the bit torrent concept is legal, it is what other people do with it that makes it ilegal, like if i wanted to share my program with lots of people bit torrent makes it easy to do that
[21/08/2004 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah that's true
[21/08/2004 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: then i shouldn't have to worry about them being interested in what is on my computer
[21/08/2004 10:25 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah that's also true 
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: anywho you can download anything on these sites that i found including full music albums at once
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: and any software with register keys and all kinds of stuff
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: games
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: definitely games
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: lots of game options
[21/08/2004 10:27 PM] EricGFoehner: cool
[21/08/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: i wonder if i could find Doom 3
[21/08/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably take a year to download i'd rather just buy it
[21/08/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: it doesn't take up CPU either, i could be working on websites or playing quake with no problem what so ever
[21/08/2004 10:29 PM] EricGFoehner: how fast does it download 
[21/08/2004 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: depends on connection
[21/08/2004 10:29 PM] EricGFoehner: what if it were mine 
[21/08/2004 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: my connection sucks because i'm using a wireless upstairs at the other side of the house that only gets 48 bits/ per second
[21/08/2004 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: on average during the day
[21/08/2004 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: right now it is about 30
[21/08/2004 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: so it sucks
[21/08/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: but some things depending on size and how many people are sharing the bits with you it can take 3 days or 25 mins
[21/08/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: just depends
[21/08/2004 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[21/08/2004 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it doesn't take up cpu so let it run
[21/08/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: this site has a real nice gui
[21/08/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: go get the torrent so you can use it to

[03/09/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: Dear Mr. Good, 
  
 this is the webmaster of the Pinnacle High School Band Website.  I understand that you are upset about our claim to the domain.  Weather it was yours or ours first is irrelevant, but we have had this domain for 2 years now, and before we registered for this domain we checked if it was available days in advance.  However if you would like to link to each other sites, because the suffix “.net” and “.com” are very similar and can easily be confused, I would be glad to put a link to your site, as long as you agree to return the favor. 
  
   
  
 again I apologize for the inconvenience, and I hope now you realize that you are able to renew the domain before it expires.  If you have a reliable service provider, most of the time they will warn you, or renew it for you, then you will owe the service provider instead.  This helps avoid such conflict like this one. 
  
   
  
 hope we don’t have any further problems, with our domains being so similar. 
  
   
  
 sincerely 
  
 ~brian Cullinan~ 
  
   
  
 P.S. That is a very nice, quality site you have there.

[21/11/2004 10:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: President Bush sucks.
[21/11/2004 10:13 PM] EricGFoehner: so if im talking about a president of the US but not a specific one, i don't capitalize it 
[21/11/2004 10:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: its like saying Mister or Misses

[21/11/2004 10:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: President of the United States
[21/11/2004 10:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: because you are talking about the current one

[21/11/2004 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: for example, Having the right qualifications is a crucial aspect in becoming a great President
[21/11/2004 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: is that capitalized 
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i would say no
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: because it is not talking about a pronoun
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: a specific president
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] EricGFoehner: what about
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: only pronouns are capitalized
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] EricGFoehner: The President should be a natural-born citizen of the United States
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i would say no again
[21/11/2004 10:15 PM] EricGFoehner: ok

[23/11/2004 03:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: I hereby resign from my position as last trumpet player in the jazz band.  The reason being, I am not as enthusiastic about playing with the jazz ensemble as I have been in previous years.  As a result of lack of enthusiasm I believe that it may become an unpleasant experience for both of us.  I do not wish that to happen.  I hope now that you can receive this in time to contact another person to take my place.  I will be bringing my brother Andrew tonight, and can turn in the music I received last week.  I apologize for any inconvenience, and I hope you enjoy jazz band as much as I have in previous years.

[23/11/2004 03:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: what?

[24/11/2004 04:19 PM] EricGFoehner: cause that thing didn't work for me
[24/11/2004 04:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: you used game drive
[24/11/2004 04:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: not virtual daemon
[24/11/2004 04:20 PM] EricGFoehner: i tried

[24/11/2004 04:20 PM] EricGFoehner: why didn't you tell me about virtual daemon 
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: because it doesn't rip games to the hard drive
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: it just enables you to use them
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: game drive is the important one
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: virtual daemon is just a nifty little tool
[24/11/2004 04:21 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[24/11/2004 04:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is better then game drive when it comes to actually using the cd images

[30/11/2004 10:26 PM] EricGFoehner: shut up
[30/11/2004 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should have thought about that earlier
[30/11/2004 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[30/11/2004 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: did you know you made her cry during pep band last year because you think with your penis
[30/11/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am disinclined to acquiesce your request
[30/11/2004 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: how did i make her cry?
[30/11/2004 10:29 PM] EricGFoehner: because you were always flirting with andrea 
[30/11/2004 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol only because she never payed any attention to me
[30/11/2004 10:30 PM] EricGFoehner: she was like 2 rows in front of you facing the other way 
[30/11/2004 10:30 PM] EricGFoehner: that's no reason to flirt with someone else anyway
[30/11/2004 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: how many times do i have to explain, i'm not the only one that made mistakes, she made plenty herself, luckily for you it was because of me that she learned from those mistakes which is why you two are closer
[30/11/2004 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[30/11/2004 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: how many times did you ever see her come up to me and put her arm around me? hardly ever, it was always me putting my arms around her, it was i who always took her hand, it was i who spoke adoring words to her, to make her feel special and good about herself, it was always i who started the conversations
[30/11/2004 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: how many times did she return such notions? hardly...
[30/11/2004 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: but she learned didn't she?
[30/11/2004 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should be greatful
[30/11/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: but all you can do is bring up past, worser times, and ruin my joking mood
[30/11/2004 10:33 PM] EricGFoehner: sorry
[30/11/2004 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: anything to say; you have?
[30/11/2004 10:33 PM] EricGFoehner: well yoda...
[30/11/2004 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't apologize
[30/11/2004 10:34 PM] EricGFoehner: its hard to think that you had to initiate everything 
[30/11/2004 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: just understand that first relationships never last, and be grateful that i was her first, i was the one so poorly disregarded not you
[30/11/2004 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: why is that?
[30/11/2004 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: you wouldn't understand, she doesn't treat you like she treated me
[30/11/2004 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: she doesn't ignore you
[30/11/2004 10:35 PM] EricGFoehner: i know
[30/11/2004 10:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: and some of that is because of what happened in her first relationship
[30/11/2004 10:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: everyone grows wiser, myself included
[30/11/2004 10:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: i hope you are both wise in your relationship
[30/11/2004 10:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: shes a great girl, don't fuck it up like i did
[30/11/2004 10:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: glad we had this talk
[30/11/2004 10:37 PM] EricGFoehner: so you're arent pissed 
[30/11/2004 10:37 PM] EricGFoehner: you aren't*
[30/11/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: glad i could let you know, now you should have a better understanding of what i thought as apposed to just hearing what she thinks all the time
[30/11/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[30/11/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: nothing angers me anymore
[30/11/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just don't like to think about it is all
[30/11/2004 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i don't

[13/12/2004 01:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: go to the site but type in a different file name
[13/12/2004 01:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: like forums.php
[13/12/2004 01:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: or index.php
[13/12/2004 01:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: or else it will keep redirecting because internet explorer is gay like that
[13/12/2004 01:35 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[13/12/2004 01:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: eric
[13/12/2004 01:38 PM] EricGFoehner: what
[13/12/2004 01:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you are the only one using that computer you should use dynamic IP
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: not static
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] EricGFoehner: what is that 
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: so every time you go to a different site the last 3 numbers in your ip address change
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: harder to ping you see
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: therefore harder to track
[13/12/2004 01:39 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[13/12/2004 01:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: actually i don't think yours can do it
[13/12/2004 01:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: because that intel anypoint is ghetto
[13/12/2004 01:41 PM] EricGFoehner: why
[13/12/2004 01:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: because its old

[13/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: see you are learning so much from me today
[13/12/2004 01:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is a list of MAC addresses and my computer goes and finds the one that matches and can only use the IP it corresponds with
[13/12/2004 01:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: a MAC = the number on your internet card
[13/12/2004 01:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: the thing microsoft records to keep track of where their stuff has been installed

[14/12/2004 09:14 PM] EricGFoehner: well i don't think her mom told her this, and please don't tell anybody, but pete put some fertilizer in the rose bushes and jake got into it 
[14/12/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: ... wow
[14/12/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: that sucks

[14/12/2004 09:15 PM] EricGFoehner: she didn't tell them about it because she doesn't want them blaming it on pete

[14/12/2004 09:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's a really shitty way to do
[14/12/2004 09:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that's why mrs. warned us about using the field when it said it was being over seeded
[14/12/2004 09:17 PM] EricGFoehner: is that a pun?
[14/12/2004 09:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they put fertalizer down, and she was worried we would eat it

[14/12/2004 09:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: ...
[14/12/2004 09:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: the last thing i want to do is hurt her more in this lifetime

[14/12/2004 09:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: even though i'm an asshole sometimes, i don't want to hurt the girl

[17/12/2004 01:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: An away message is a function of some instant messaging applications whereby a user may post a message that appears automatically to other users if they attempt to make contact, and he or she is not available.  It is analogous to the voice message in an answering machine or voice mail system.  However, away messages are often updated much more frequently than messages in answering machines, and thus may serve as a means of instant, limited "publication" or indirect communication.q 
[17/12/2004 01:19 AM] EricGFoehner: so that's what they are
[17/12/2004 01:19 AM] BrianJCullinan: you could have said outside my car this morning that you had some things to do today

[17/12/2004 01:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: See also awake (disambiguation).''
 being awake is a state of consciousness, the opposite of sleep. Communication and ambulation are generally conducted while awake, except in the case of sleepwalking. Animals can run, walk and eat while awake; humans can also talk, listen, write, read and productively think and work in the awake state. Awakening usually starts with the opening of the eye lids.

[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: next
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: ummmmmmm
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: put in the other cd
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: and open the urban terror directory
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: you installed the point release already?
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: that was quick
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[17/12/2004 01:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok now install urban terror
[17/12/2004 01:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can remember if that one comes with the install or if you do it manually
[17/12/2004 01:45 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't see any install 
[17/12/2004 01:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: manually = 
 open the quake 3 folder in windows explorer and create a directory called Q3UT3
[17/12/2004 01:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: and copy everything in the ZIP into that folder
[17/12/2004 01:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it is installed
[17/12/2004 01:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: easy huh?
[17/12/2004 01:46 PM] EricGFoehner: do i copy everything in it or the zip folder itself 
[17/12/2004 01:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: not if it has a urban terror folder in it
[17/12/2004 01:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: copy all the files in the zip outside the zip folder into the q3ut3
[17/12/2004 01:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: so no don't just copy the zip, copy everything inside it
[17/12/2004 01:48 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[17/12/2004 01:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: so it should look like
 Quake3.exe
 Baseq3
 other files
 Q3UT3
 |----lots of files
 
[17/12/2004 01:49 PM] EricGFoehner: it says 13 hours 21 minutes remaining 
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: if that doesn't go down to like 5 min in 5 min try copying the file off the cd first and the copying the stuff out of it
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: there is no way this entire process should take more than 20 minutes
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: is it going down at all?
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] EricGFoehner: 30 seconds
[17/12/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok very good
[17/12/2004 01:51 PM] EricGFoehner: 15
[17/12/2004 01:51 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[17/12/2004 01:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: the last couple of things to do is, copy the maps that end in .pk3 (sort by type) into the Q3UT3 folder
[17/12/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: then rename the others unless they have a .pk3 file in them
[17/12/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: back to the other cd
[17/12/2004 01:53 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[17/12/2004 01:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok, tell me when you have all those copied
[17/12/2004 01:53 PM] EricGFoehner: what copied 
[17/12/2004 01:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: the maps
[17/12/2004 01:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: on the cd
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: copy the map files
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: not just the folder
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: only copy the pk3 files
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: into the q3UT3 directory
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: their all for urban terror
[17/12/2004 01:54 PM] EricGFoehner: theres a lot of them

[17/12/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't worry about the zip ones yet
[17/12/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: just copy them
[17/12/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: they won't take long
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] EricGFoehner: it says theres already a file with the same name
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] EricGFoehner: asking if i want to replace it 
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmm
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: probably no then
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: which file is it?
[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: different sizes?

[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] EricGFoehner: i already said no
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't worry bout it then
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: after that go to the base directory and find the folder PB
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: this is punk buster
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: we'll need to do an update for this
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: copy, off the same CD, pbweb.exe
[17/12/2004 01:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: once that is done, start quake 3 and go into multiplayer and enable punkbuster in the right upper corner
[17/12/2004 01:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: we should be just about there
[17/12/2004 01:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't worry about the eye yet
[17/12/2004 01:59 PM] EricGFoehner: ok

[17/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: in quake 3 folder
[17/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: top folder, not mod folder
[17/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok?
[17/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: then run it
[17/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it will say it is updating
[17/12/2004 02:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it will say attempting to download files with strange numbers for names

[05/01/2005 03:16 PM] EricGFoehner: but since i don't have a pussy you didn't want to do it 
[05/01/2005 03:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm going to play games, let me know when you are going to stop sacrificing our friendship for your girlfriend, the only reason you want to drop out of band is because she isn't in it with you, you miss 5 f-ing extra minutes with her and you just want to drop something your done for 3 and a half years
[05/01/2005 03:17 PM] EricGFoehner: what the fuck are you talking about 
[05/01/2005 03:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah eric its all because shes a girl that's it
[05/01/2005 03:17 PM] EricGFoehner: this has nothing to do with brianna 
[05/01/2005 03:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: well since i don't have a pussy you don't want to stay in band
[05/01/2005 03:18 PM] EricGFoehner: no
[05/01/2005 03:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: it goes both ways
[05/01/2005 03:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[05/01/2005 03:18 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't want to stay in band because your switching to tuba
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] EricGFoehner: and you're probably the only thing that could keep me sane this semester 
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok like i said this morning, if i had completely dropped out of band but Brianna was still in it, you would stay in it too
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] EricGFoehner: because i would still have a friend
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: you're just mad because you can't spend five minutes before and after class with her
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: shes not in the same section
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] EricGFoehner: you're my only other friend 
[05/01/2005 03:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: so we can only be friends in band together if i am in the same section?
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] EricGFoehner: no
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: but with Brianna, even though shes in a different section you can still be friends with her
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] EricGFoehner: god damnit brian, im not dropping out because of biranna 
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] EricGFoehner: brianna
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll be sitting right next to you half the time
[05/01/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: we have completely different views on the subject
[05/01/2005 03:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: if i quit band and Brianna was still in it, would you drop out?
[05/01/2005 03:21 PM] EricGFoehner: no, because brianna would be alone 
[05/01/2005 03:21 PM] EricGFoehner: and why would you drop out 
[05/01/2005 03:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: my point exactly you wouldn't drop out, she has other friends in band, shes not alone
[05/01/2005 03:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm just trying to make a point
[05/01/2005 03:22 PM] EricGFoehner: erika 
[05/01/2005 03:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: but you don't value our friendship enough to stay in the only class we have together even though i will see you all the time and nothing will change
[05/01/2005 03:23 PM] EricGFoehner: i absolutely cant stand that class, i feel like shit just being in that room
[05/01/2005 03:23 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't like myself because im no good
[05/01/2005 03:24 PM] EricGFoehner: and its my own fault, i know 
[05/01/2005 03:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you're better then all the freshmen in that class
[05/01/2005 03:25 PM] EricGFoehner: they didn't get to try out 
[05/01/2005 03:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but you are still better
[05/01/2005 03:25 PM] EricGFoehner: she was going to take 5 trumpets in honor band, but i was so bad she only took 4 
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's not it
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah it is 
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: its because she didn't want that fat bastard daniel
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: hes the only one that might be better than you
[05/01/2005 03:26 PM] EricGFoehner: daniel got kicked out and she didn't find a peplacment, because i was the only one she had left 
[05/01/2005 03:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: no he wasn't kicked out
[05/01/2005 03:27 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[05/01/2005 03:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: what for then?
[05/01/2005 03:28 PM] EricGFoehner: he was in it until his little graduation stunt 
[05/01/2005 03:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: because he showed up late?
[05/01/2005 03:28 PM] EricGFoehner: because he was sleeping, then we walked straight across the field while graduation was going on 
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] EricGFoehner: and was really late 
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: that was last f-ing year
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: omfg
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: she is probably one of the worst people i know
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, he got kicked out last year 
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that still doesn't change the fact that you are better than all of the freshmen
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] EricGFoehner: eric is better 
[05/01/2005 03:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it wasn't even going on last year
[05/01/2005 03:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: how could he get kicked out of something that hasn't even started
[05/01/2005 03:30 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't know
[05/01/2005 03:30 PM] EricGFoehner: that's what she did 
[05/01/2005 03:30 PM] EricGFoehner: daniel told me 
[05/01/2005 03:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: wow
[05/01/2005 03:31 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, so she only decided to have 4
[05/01/2005 03:33 PM] EricGFoehner: how would that make you feel if there was tryouts for something, anything, and the person who was conducting the tryouts wanted 5 people and 6 people tried out, but you were so bad she only wanted 4
[05/01/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol pretty bad
[05/01/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: but can't you put up with it and stay in band with me?
[05/01/2005 03:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean if we never put up with anything, people just wouldn't get anywhere in life
[05/01/2005 03:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: there are gonna be bitches like mrs. earnest everywhere you go
[05/01/2005 03:35 PM] EricGFoehner: ive put up with her shit for 3 1/2 years 
[05/01/2005 03:35 PM] EricGFoehner: but she really did it this time 
[05/01/2005 03:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah so what is another 1/2?

[05/01/2005 08:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: because you are not acting like you are gonna be able to tolerate me any longer
[05/01/2005 08:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: *much longer

[05/01/2005 08:45 PM] EricGFoehner: it band class 
[05/01/2005 08:45 PM] EricGFoehner: its mrs earnest

[05/01/2005 08:46 PM] EricGFoehner: i cant tomorrow 
[05/01/2005 08:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: how come?
[05/01/2005 08:48 PM] EricGFoehner: i wont be there at lunch

[05/01/2005 08:49 PM] EricGFoehner: when would i have time to go to the ofice?
[05/01/2005 08:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: before we leave for lunch
[01/05/2005 08:51 PM] EricGFoehner: ill just do it friday
[01/05/2005 08:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/05/2005 08:51 PM] EricGFoehner: give the class one more chance 
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: you could in the morning
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: you better request to see a counslor
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: because it usually takes a day
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you have to request most of the time
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: so request tomorrow at lunch
[01/05/2005 08:52 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah but i want to do it after lunch so the office isnt busy 
[01/05/2005 08:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but you still might have to request
[01/05/2005 08:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: so if you go in friday and they tell you to fill out a request form, then you won't get it until monday
[01/05/2005 08:53 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't know the process about doing this 
[01/05/2005 08:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then they will probably discard it monday morning because they don't want to put up with schedual changes, so then it will be tuesday before you have to go in and ask about switching out and by then they will tell you "it is to late to make schedual changes you should have done that last week"
[01/05/2005 08:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: then in order to make a schedule change, your mommy will have to call in and or possibly come to the office creating more work for both of you

[01/09/2005 12:08 AM] EricGFoehner: what
[01/09/2005 12:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: almost 7
[01/09/2005 12:09 AM] EricGFoehner: thing 
[01/09/2005 12:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: the dvd
[01/09/2005 12:09 AM] EricGFoehner: the south park dvd 
[01/09/2005 12:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 12:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i have 20 gigs of other south park episodes
[01/09/2005 12:11 AM] EricGFoehner: wow
[01/09/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: because i recorded it dvd format
[01/09/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: oops
[01/09/2005 12:11 AM] EricGFoehner: all my  recorded tv is 62 gigs 
[01/09/2005 12:12 AM] EricGFoehner: i need to lower the quality 
[01/09/2005 12:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 12:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: why not burn DVDs and just copy them to that?
[01/09/2005 12:12 AM] EricGFoehner: what 
[01/09/2005 12:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: burn your tv files to DVD
[01/09/2005 12:13 AM] BrianJCullinan: have a dvd for each south park season
[01/09/2005 12:13 AM] EricGFoehner: oh
[01/09/2005 12:13 AM] BrianJCullinan: you can add files after you burn a dvd
[01/09/2005 12:13 AM] BrianJCullinan: roxio is real good with the drag to disc stuff
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] EricGFoehner: add files to the burnt dvd?
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: then to make it permanent just "finalize" the disc
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: roxio can do it
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: and most things today
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: it simulates a rewritable cd or dvd
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: its really cool
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: pretty amazing
[01/09/2005 12:14 AM] EricGFoehner: oh
[01/09/2005 12:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: but if you delete a file you don't get that space back
[01/09/2005 12:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: only problem
[01/09/2005 12:15 AM] EricGFoehner: oh
[01/09/2005 12:15 AM] BrianJCullinan: because it really adds something telling the reader to skip over that part
[01/09/2005 12:16 AM] EricGFoehner: so it doesn't delete it, it just skips it
[01/09/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/09/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: but looks like it deletes
[01/09/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: it
[01/09/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: oh
[01/09/2005 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: well i'm going to bed

[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah i know
[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's not very responsible of you
[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] EricGFoehner: i know, but i don't really care
[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have an obligation to be there, or let her know ahead of time, even if you really don't care
[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] EricGFoehner: was she angry?
[01/11/2005 09:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: when you get a job, they will expect you to let them know you are quitting at least 2 weeks ahead of time

[01/11/2005 09:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: there will always be people you don't get along with

[01/11/2005 09:29 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't think my boss will treat me like leftovers 
[01/11/2005 09:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: actually he probably will
[01/11/2005 09:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: he or she
[01/11/2005 09:32 PM] EricGFoehner:  i don't think every one i meet in life will be bias like mrs earnest 
[01/11/2005 09:32 PM] EricGFoehner: there are good people out there brian 
[01/11/2005 09:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: but there are a lot of bad
[01/11/2005 09:32 PM] EricGFoehner: like mrs e 
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: could be
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] EricGFoehner: was she angry at me?
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] EricGFoehner: what did she say?
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: that you are a problem child
[01/11/2005 09:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: j/k
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: that, "none of them told me that"
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: you weren't the only one not there
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] EricGFoehner: how many trumpets were there
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: 3
[01/11/2005 09:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: enough i guess
[01/11/2005 09:35 PM] EricGFoehner: briannas mom told mrs earnest that she wouldn't be there 
[01/11/2005 09:36 PM] EricGFoehner: i just don't care so i didn't tell anyone 
[01/11/2005 09:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's still not good
[01/11/2005 09:37 PM] EricGFoehner: i know
[01/11/2005 09:37 PM] EricGFoehner: but guess what 
[01/11/2005 09:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah?
[01/11/2005 09:38 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't care 
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah i get it
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: you don't care about anything but Brianna
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: i completely understand
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] EricGFoehner: don't even bring her into this
[01/11/2005 09:39 PM] EricGFoehner: she has nothing to do with it 
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: except that she didn't go either
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and she hardly talks to her friends anymore, just like you
[01/11/2005 09:40 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't have any friends brian 
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: only you 
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: or how all you do in the mornings is pay attention to her, and hardly try to have a conversation with me
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: well you're not going to have any if you keep acting like this
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: what the fuck 
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: you could have friends if you spent time with other people instead of just her
[01/11/2005 09:41 PM] EricGFoehner: why do you always bring everything back to this 
[01/11/2005 09:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: what should i say? "go ahead, don't try to make other friends.  when you break up with Brianna then you will have no one."  Is that what i should say?  I want you to have more, you mean more to me then she means to you Eric
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if you're happy, and you think your "in love".  Then don't change anything because of me
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: really don't change
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you're own thing
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
[01/11/2005 09:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll act even more like you and just "not care"
[01/11/2005 09:45 PM] EricGFoehner: what is your problem 
[01/11/2005 09:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: nothing, i don't have a problem, i don't care
[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] EricGFoehner: all i can say is wow 
[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/11/2005 09:46 PM] EricGFoehner: why do you like fighting about this all of the time?
[01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't "like" it
[01/11/2005 09:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: like i said, i don't want you to be alone when you don't have her anymore
[01/11/2005 09:49 PM] EricGFoehner: this is the life i have chosen, when i lose her ill be a friendless failure, drop out of college, take after my dad and become an alcoholic then shoot myself in the head 
[01/11/2005 09:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not going to let you
[01/11/2005 09:50 PM] EricGFoehner: why i would have driven you away too
[01/11/2005 09:50 PM] EricGFoehner: i wont have anyone but my friend budwieser 
[01/11/2005 09:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: unlike Brianna, Eric, i am not going to leave you when someone better comes along
[01/11/2005 09:51 PM] EricGFoehner: wow
[01/11/2005 09:51 PM] EricGFoehner: you just said you would
[01/11/2005 09:51 PM] EricGFoehner: [09:41:02:PM] BrianJCullinan: well you're not going to have any if you keep acting like this
[01/11/2005 09:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's why i am trying to make you understand that you are messing up relationships because of being with her
[01/11/2005 09:52 PM] EricGFoehner: messing up?
[01/11/2005 09:52 PM] EricGFoehner: i already did
[01/11/2005 09:52 PM] EricGFoehner: i have no friends 
[01/11/2005 09:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: but you could make friends
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] EricGFoehner: why? ill just ditch them for brianna, you know that
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's not a good thing
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: it needs to change
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can make it change
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] EricGFoehner: i was being sarcastic 
[01/11/2005 09:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: only you can
[01/11/2005 09:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can't
[01/11/2005 09:54 PM] EricGFoehner: no one wants to be my friend, im a loser that only thinks about one thing 
[01/11/2005 09:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: you're the only one who can change that
[01/11/2005 09:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can only observe and help you as much as you let me
[01/11/2005 09:56 PM] EricGFoehner: even if i try brian, im a jerk no one will want to be my friend 
[01/11/2005 09:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can change it eric

[01/11/2005 09:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: they say you spend to much time with Brianna
[01/11/2005 09:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: that she won't have any friends soon either

[01/11/2005 10:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: then it will still be a problem?
[01/11/2005 10:03 PM] EricGFoehner: then everyone can stop worrying about my life and start worrying about their own 
[01/11/2005 10:03 PM] EricGFoehner: what will still be a problem?
[01/11/2005 10:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: that right huh?

[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] EricGFoehner: graduating high school is only the beginning 
[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: they should have been
[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: they were supposed to be
[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: what will be the best years?
[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't know
[01/11/2005 10:07 PM] EricGFoehner: i wasn't planning on a certain period of time
[01/11/2005 10:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: wow
[01/11/2005 10:08 PM] EricGFoehner: what
[01/11/2005 10:08 PM] EricGFoehner: how can you?
[01/11/2005 10:08 PM] EricGFoehner: just because someone tells you high school is supposed to be your greatest years doesn't mean jack shit 
[01/11/2005 10:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: well it was the best years on my life, until this year
[01/11/2005 10:09 PM] EricGFoehner: im sorry i ruined it for you 
[01/11/2005 10:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry i let you
[01/11/2005 10:09 PM] EricGFoehner: wow, why don't you just forget about me then 
[01/11/2005 10:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i have hope for you
[01/11/2005 10:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can't do that
[01/11/2005 10:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am your friend
[01/11/2005 10:11 PM] EricGFoehner: i ruined your last year in high school, what a good friend i am 
[01/11/2005 10:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll get over it
[01/11/2005 10:12 PM] EricGFoehner: i ditch you for a girl, a quality i always look for in friends 
[01/11/2005 10:12 PM] EricGFoehner: im an asshole, you cant beat that
[01/11/2005 10:12 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't like mexicans, well no one does but still 
[01/11/2005 10:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh well
[01/11/2005 10:14 PM] EricGFoehner: just because i didn't go to pep band 
[01/11/2005 10:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[01/11/2005 10:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: just because
[01/11/2005 10:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: you spend to much time with her
[01/11/2005 10:16 PM] EricGFoehner: sorry
[01/11/2005 10:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/11/2005 10:17 PM] EricGFoehner: do you think our relationship is just a little crush thing?
[01/11/2005 10:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think that there is no way a first relationship can last, and shouldn't last, you need to explore your options!
[01/11/2005 10:18 PM] EricGFoehner: how long do you think we will last? 
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: a few more months
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe college
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] EricGFoehner: what if i prove you wrong?
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: then anytime after that
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: you need to explore your options
[01/11/2005 10:19 PM] EricGFoehner: why
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: if it leads you back to her then good for you
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: because there are better things out there
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: better girls
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: better matches
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] EricGFoehner: im not going to break up with her to go out with other girls 
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: someone that will not allow you to ruin your friendships
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: over another person
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] EricGFoehner: wow
[01/11/2005 10:20 PM] EricGFoehner: i made the choice brian 
[01/11/2005 10:21 PM] EricGFoehner: just because she didn't love you doesn't mean she isnt right for me 
[01/11/2005 10:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's irrelevant
[01/11/2005 10:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: i was her first boyfriend, it didn't last
[01/11/2005 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: she is your first girlfriend, it won't last
[01/11/2005 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: see the analogy?
[01/11/2005 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: no
[01/11/2005 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: because they are completely different 
[01/11/2005 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: how?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] EricGFoehner: there is not a single similarity from your relationship with her and mine 
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: really?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: does she kiss you everyday?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] EricGFoehner: can you give me one
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: are you attracted to her?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: theres 2
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: does she hug you?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: does she spend time with you?
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: hey looks 2 more
[01/11/2005 10:23 PM] EricGFoehner: she does it out of the own will 
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: *her own will
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: she did it with me too
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you think i forced myself into her life?
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: you pushed her
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: i never pushed her
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: i communicated with her
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: asked her want she wanted
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: theres your mistake
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it led to what it led to
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: what?
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: communicating?
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: no
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] EricGFoehner: thinking you didn't push her
[01/11/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is bad to communicate in relationships?
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] EricGFoehner: i already said that wasn't the problem 
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: because i asked her what she wanted?
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] EricGFoehner: ugh
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: Eric she lied to me
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: she didn't know what she wanted
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: she was immature and still is
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you can't see it
[01/11/2005 10:25 PM] EricGFoehner: no shes not 
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: because you are blinded
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] EricGFoehner: how is she immature?
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: blinded by the light
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] EricGFoehner: how?
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: she is immature in how she acted
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: even when she was with me
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] EricGFoehner: how is she now?
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i didn't know it until it was over
[01/11/2005 10:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: because she does the same things to you that she did to me
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] EricGFoehner: like what 
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: just the way she hangs on you
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: the way she looks at you
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: its all the same
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] EricGFoehner: she didn't do that to you 
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: and its disgusting
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: how do you know?
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: did you spy on us?
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] EricGFoehner: what
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: or did you communicate with her?
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] EricGFoehner: no i didnt
[01/11/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: how do you know she didn't do the same things?
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: you guys go to the same school
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: she told me
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: not then but later 
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: how do you know it wasn't all what she wanted?
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: Eric she told me she loved me
[01/11/2005 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: how much bigger lie could you make
[01/11/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't you think she would lie about what happened while telling you/
[01/11/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: ?
[01/11/2005 10:29 PM] EricGFoehner: what?
[01/11/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: if she wasn't so proud of the things she did, isn't that reason enough to lie about them?
[01/11/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: to make up a story about how she never liked me?
[01/11/2005 10:30 PM] EricGFoehner: she liked you 
[01/11/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: and fell in love with you immediately after?
[01/11/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: shes lying, lying to make herself closer to you
[01/11/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: which granted its a very smart way to go about doing things
[01/11/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it is still lying!
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: you think she is lying to me? 
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think she did
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: about what?
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: she lied to you about me and her
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: what about you and her
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: about what she did
[01/11/2005 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: about how she felt about me
[01/11/2005 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you know, i was like you, and this is just an observation
[01/11/2005 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i used to like this girl, only because i knew she liked me
[01/11/2005 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: then after she dumped me, i realized that she wasn't really that great, personality wise, we kind of clashed
[01/11/2005 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think that's how it started between you two, maybe it isn't like that now, but that's how it started
[01/11/2005 10:33 PM] EricGFoehner: she liked you because you are the only guy who ever pursued her 
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: exactly
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: now you're thinking just like me
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: so she didn't "really" like me
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] EricGFoehner: you think that she is the only girl that has like me?
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: she only liked me because i liked her
[01/11/2005 10:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: no, but i think she is the only girl that has persued you
[01/11/2005 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: and that's why you like her so much
[01/11/2005 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: its the same for everyone
[01/11/2005 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not zeroing you out
[01/11/2005 10:35 PM] EricGFoehner: no, there have been some stalker types in my life 
[01/11/2005 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, that's why it won't last, because you will come to realize that there are better matches out there
[01/11/2005 10:36 PM] EricGFoehner: sure

[01/12/2005 09:42 PM] EricGFoehner: so how was your day?
[01/12/2005 09:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: All I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
  
 I like watchin' the puddles gather rain  
  
 and all I can do is just pour some tea for two  
  
 and speak my point of view  
  
 but it's not sane, It's not sane  
  
 I just want some one to say to me  
  
 i'll always be there when you wake  
  
 ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today  
  
 so stay with me and I'll have it made  
  
 and I don't understand why I sleep all day  
  
 and I start to complain that there's no rain  
  
 and all I can do is read a book to stay awake  
  
 and it rips my life away, but it's a great escape  
  
 escape......escape......escape......  
  
 all I can say is that my life is pretty plain  
  
 ya don't like my point of view  
  
 ya think I'm insane  
  
 its not sane......it's not sane

[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: are you in trouble?
[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: how did it happen?
[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: can you answer any of these questions?
[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: sry
[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: i was whitening my shoes
[01/23/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: oh
[01/23/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: so these people have a lexus suv with custom rims on it
[01/23/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: and the pull up and claim we scratched their front tire and rim and the back tire and rim
[01/23/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: so we back into ever spot we park, there is no way we could have messed up the front tire
[01/23/2005 12:19 AM] EricGFoehner: you you the one that parked it 
[01/23/2005 12:19 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i parked every car so slow tonight, and their was my trainer in the passenger seat making sure i didn't come to close to anything
[01/23/2005 12:19 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes i parked it
[01/23/2005 12:20 AM] BrianJCullinan: and the cement curb was side of the car that didn't have any damages when we parked it in a numbered spot
[01/23/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: and you would have to be a friggin idiot and drive on top of a sidewalk to mess up both wheels on one side when pulling it out
[01/23/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: i didn't pull it out
[01/23/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: but there's no way we could have done that kind of damage to the car
[01/23/2005 12:22 AM] EricGFoehner: so who is paying for it 
[01/23/2005 12:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: don't matter it won't be us
[01/23/2005 12:23 AM] BrianJCullinan: i mean it won't be the valet
[01/23/2005 12:23 AM] BrianJCullinan: even if they take us to court
[01/23/2005 12:23 AM] EricGFoehner: are you in trouble or anything
[01/23/2005 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: we do a damage check whenever we get a new car up to the drive, and we point out to the cameras where the damages are and then we mark it down on a ticket
[01/23/2005 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: and they saw me point to the tire on video
[01/23/2005 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: we can use that in court
[01/23/2005 12:24 AM] EricGFoehner: cool
[01/23/2005 12:25 AM] BrianJCullinan: not only that but they didn't say anything until they were already home
[01/23/2005 12:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: they happen to notice the damage after they have been driving it around
[01/23/2005 12:26 AM] EricGFoehner: that wont help them in court 
[01/23/2005 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/23/2005 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: not only that but we will get everything we can to pound these bitches

[01/23/2005 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: but assuming we win, i get 50 bucks
[01/23/2005 12:29 AM] EricGFoehner: why
[01/23/2005 12:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: i did the damage check and pointed out the tire

[01/27/2005 06:41 AM] BrianJCullinan: i wanted to tell you i bought that song only to find you with Brianna, like usual, but this time you are fondling the little girl you used to call the kids meal

[01/27/2005 06:45 AM] EricGFoehner: no one cares but you 
[01/27/2005 06:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: because no one else saw it

[01/28/2005 11:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you are the only one that can decide if we will be friends
[01/28/2005 11:24 PM] EricGFoehner: what 
[01/28/2005 11:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just sometimes wonder if you even appreciate it when i invite both you and your girlfriend to outings like the movies, even though according to Brianna i am still not "over" her
[01/28/2005 11:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: i thought i was being mature by asking you both to enjoy the event
[01/28/2005 11:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: instead of just you
[01/28/2005 11:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that is not enough maturity to be considered "over" her?
[01/28/2005 11:27 PM] EricGFoehner: i do appreciate it 
[01/28/2005 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: well that's good to hear

[01/28/2005 11:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am sure she will clarify the subject for me
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] EricGFoehner: im going though a really rough time right now, both of my sisters moved out, my mom moved out, im basically living alone with satan and someone who only cares about work, and all this starts again
[01/28/2005 11:30 PM] EricGFoehner: its not fun 
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: why aren't you moving?
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] EricGFoehner: because i don't want to 
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] EricGFoehner: that place is a shit hole 
[01/28/2005 11:31 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't want to live in the ghetto

[01/28/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: then i am sorry this argument came at such an inconvenient time

[01/29/2005 12:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: if you truly think you should see it out of necessity, i am sure she would be glad to
[01/29/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: there will always be things left unsaid between her an I, but i guess i win again, just like usual she calls me names and blocks me
[01/29/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: just like usual
[01/29/2005 12:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: do you blame me for preferring to speak to you about a problem, rather her?
[01/29/2005 12:12 AM] EricGFoehner: i don't know whats so bothersome between you to
[01/29/2005 12:13 AM] BrianJCullinan: i think that the away message problem started it, and she provoked me to point out every problem i had with her, and it just elevated from there
[01/29/2005 12:13 AM] EricGFoehner: im sorry it got to you so much 
[01/29/2005 12:13 AM] BrianJCullinan: i didn't feel the message was appropriate, especially had her mother found out about it, it could have caused bigger problems
[01/29/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: but it didnt
[01/29/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: because i would not go behind your back and show such a thing to her mother just to spite you
[01/29/2005 12:14 AM] BrianJCullinan: that would be absurd
[01/29/2005 12:15 AM] EricGFoehner: but how would her mom find out?
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] EricGFoehner: she doesn't use aim
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: because i would not go behind your back and show such a thing to her mother just to spite you
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] EricGFoehner: poopiedoobles?
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: if i or someone else who had seen it told her mom
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] EricGFoehner: why are you using that one 
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: jeneen uses aim
[01/29/2005 12:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: and so does her father
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: isn't that a concern?
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: murphey's law
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: is something can go wrong, it will
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: but it didn't
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: so no worries
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: no worries?
[01/29/2005 12:17 AM] EricGFoehner: look what it started 
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: its over, is it not?
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] EricGFoehner: it opened up pandora box 
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: we are still speaking to eachother?
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] EricGFoehner: no, but you two still hate eachother
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] BrianJCullinan: and it was closed with Brianna: any respect I once had has disappeared
[01/29/2005 12:18 AM] EricGFoehner: and im in the middle of it all 
[01/29/2005 12:19 AM] BrianJCullinan: you need not worry yourself in the matter any longer
[01/29/2005 12:19 AM] BrianJCullinan: she blocked my ass, theres no way i could possibly talk to her
[01/29/2005 12:20 AM] BrianJCullinan: unless i confronted her in person, but like i said in my e-mail, the purpose of my argument against your away message was to inform you of the possibilities and realism of how it may be perceived  not to upset anyone
[01/29/2005 12:21 AM] EricGFoehner: what
[01/29/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: but i failed...
[01/29/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: again
[01/29/2005 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: an in person confrontation of this topic would upset her, and i don't want that to happen
[01/29/2005 12:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: that would be the only way for me to talk to her
[01/29/2005 12:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: since she blocked me
[01/29/2005 12:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: nvm
[01/29/2005 12:22 AM] EricGFoehner: is she talknig again?

[01/29/2005 12:23 AM] BrianJCullinan: good idea, you give her all my screen names for her to block right?

[01/31/2005 04:14 PM] EricGFoehner: doesn't seem like enough space 
[01/31/2005 04:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: how?

[01/31/2005 04:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: on top of the sub
[01/31/2005 04:16 PM] EricGFoehner: the sub is pretty tall
[01/31/2005 04:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: the center doesn't even matter
[01/31/2005 04:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: its the LR speakers that matter
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: the center is like an equalizer for the sub
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: just put it on the next shelf higher then
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: on top of the shelves
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: there is plenty of room
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: and a sub doesn't have to stay upright either
[01/31/2005 04:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: it can be put on its side
[01/31/2005 04:18 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[01/31/2005 04:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm pretty sure
[01/31/2005 04:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: with some advance speakers it damages them, but i doubt that it true with yours

[02/02/2005 04:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: Hugh Marston Hefner (born April 9th, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois, USA) is the founder and editor of ''Playboy'' magazine.
 
 He has since become an icon for the hedonistic ideals associated with the periodical.  He reportedly has an IQ of 150, and he has certainly been very adept at human management skills. He is also a charismatic and highly persuasive individual. He majored in philosophy at the University of Illinois.
 
 Hefner has been married twice. His 1959 breakup of his first marriage to Millie Williams, whom he married in 1949, is believed to be linked to his commencing his Playboy empire. His daughter Christie, born in 1954, is from  this marriage. Christie joined her father's editorial staff, and now holds the title of Chairman of Playboy Enterprises. He also had a son, David.
 
 He later married Playmate Kimberley Conrad in 1988. Conrad later became Playmate of the Year in 1989. This marriage broke up in 1998. The couple had two children--Marston, born 1990 and Cooper, born 1991. During this period, Hefner lived monogamously.
 
 He has also had a long line of ladyfriends including several Playboy Playmates of the Year. No children have come of these relationships--a source of speculation for many of Hefner's critics.
 
 Hefner is known to have been involved with the following Playmates: the then 18-year-old Donna Michelle (PMOY 1964), Marilyn Cole (1971), Lillian Muller (1976), Patty McGuire (1977), Terry Welles (1981) and Brande Roderick (2001). The lattermost lived openly with three other women, including two twin sisters. In 1997, Welles defeated a lawsuit launched by her former lover's empire when she used her name in connection with Playboy on a website that she created.
 
 Other noteworthy attachments include Mary Warren (1964&amp;ndash;8); Barbi Benton (1968&amp;ndash;74); Karen Christy (1971&amp;ndash;4); ex-Sunday school teacher Sandra Theodore (1974&amp;ndash;81) and then 19-year-old Carrie Leigh (1983&amp;ndash;87). The lattermost liaision ended with an attempted $35 million palimony lawsuit by Leigh against He...

[02/04/2005 11:29 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah how will the people know what to type 
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: pretty much all i have left is variables
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: and "<strings>"
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: gettings strings from between the parenthesis
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: \help
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: it will list the commands
[02/04/2005 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[02/04/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: did you try \status
[02/04/2005 11:31 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[02/04/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: awesome
[02/04/2005 11:32 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[02/04/2005 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: the \connect needs work
[02/04/2005 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: basically it will just redirect you to what ever you type
[02/04/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: \connect "somesite"
[02/04/2005 11:33 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[02/04/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i am going to make more fancy transitions
[02/04/2005 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: like typing stuff
[02/04/2005 11:34 PM] EricGFoehner: cool
[02/04/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i am also gonna make some secret stuff too
[02/04/2005 11:35 PM] EricGFoehner: oooh, secrets 
[02/04/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i will have to come up with a way to hide it
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: like put it in a separate file
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you have to know the command to open it
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i could to a fake password entry
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: but when my password is entered it would let my do special stuff
[02/04/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: then i could record passwords and try them on other stuff people use
[02/04/2005 11:37 PM] EricGFoehner: i thought you werent going to do much with it 
[02/04/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: because people use the same password everywhere
[02/04/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: that isn't much
[02/04/2005 11:37 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[02/04/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: programming the commands is easy
[02/04/2005 11:38 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[02/04/2005 11:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: bradly was being so phuking annoying tonight

[02/12/2005 12:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: hipathetically speaking, if you were old, and you saw someone else that was old, you would be able to tell that they are old
[02/12/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: but you won't be able to tell how young someone is even though they look really young
[02/12/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: just like we are young, we can tell how young someone is, because i knew they were 21, but i can't tell how old someone is
[02/12/2005 12:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: i can only tell that they are older then me
[02/12/2005 12:12 AM] BrianJCullinan: nvm

[02/24/2005 02:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you probably won't have fun if you spend the whole night in a corner with Brianna
[02/24/2005 02:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: my mom chapperoned at it last year and said there were hardly anyone younger than seniors
[02/24/2005 02:26 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, spending it with no friends will be a lot better 
[02/24/2005 02:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you think you will bring Brianna then?

[02/24/2005 02:28 PM] EricGFoehner: they arent going to stay 
[02/24/2005 02:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: but the night of graduation is for you and the rest of your class
[02/24/2005 02:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: why wouldn't that stay?
[02/24/2005 02:29 PM] EricGFoehner: because that's not how it has been with either of my sisters 
[02/24/2005 02:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: *they
[02/24/2005 02:29 PM] EricGFoehner: they didn't go

[02/24/2005 02:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[02/24/2005 02:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: why not?
[02/24/2005 02:30 PM] EricGFoehner: because they came back here with family and ate food and cake and junk

[02/24/2005 03:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if you were to ask the person that owned the site
[02/24/2005 03:14 PM] EricGFoehner: did you ask
[02/24/2005 03:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: they would be angry, and threaten you with legal cases, and say that's my stuff not yurs

[02/24/2005 03:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: but it is free to download
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean who is to stop someone from just right clicking and selecting "save picture as..."?
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am doing just that, but, uh, more efficiently
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: !
[02/24/2005 03:15 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[02/24/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: so far on bullz-eye it has parsed 13,871 urls
[02/24/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i am going to have AT LEAST that many files
[02/24/2005 03:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: but then it downloads every link on each of those pages
[02/24/2005 03:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i will have far over that
[02/24/2005 03:21 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
[02/24/2005 03:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i am downloading a copy of windows xp
[02/24/2005 03:24 PM] EricGFoehner: why 
[02/24/2005 03:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: for my managers computer
[02/24/2005 03:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe
[02/24/2005 03:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: i will have to ask him
[02/24/2005 03:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: but considering his business isn't exactly perfectly legal i don't think he will mind
[02/24/2005 03:36 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[02/24/2005 03:36 PM] EricGFoehner: what is his business?
[02/24/2005 03:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: a valet we get tips, but the job only requires that we record $2 per hour so that it is over minimum wage
[02/24/2005 03:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: so when the taxes are taken out of our checks it only shows 2 extra dollars on top of the 4 per hour
[02/24/2005 03:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: but everyone there make more then 6 dollars per hour
[02/24/2005 03:38 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[02/24/2005 03:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: soooo when the w2 comes around
[02/24/2005 03:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: we won't get very much money back, even though we should be paying the govt. money
[02/24/2005 03:38 PM] EricGFoehner: so how is that good 
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: good for us
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: because we give the govt less money
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] EricGFoehner: how 
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] EricGFoehner: but you get less back 
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then they give even more money back to us
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they aren't take as much away
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: the more they take away the more we get back
[02/24/2005 03:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they take a percentage
[02/24/2005 03:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: and usually that percentage doesn't match up with how much we really make per year, so they give it back

[03/01/2005 09:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: who was it that upset you?
[03/01/2005 09:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: Todd or your Mom?
[03/01/2005 09:55 PM] EricGFoehner: myself 
[03/01/2005 09:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: how?
[03/01/2005 09:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: you aren't sick to your stomach are you?
[03/01/2005 09:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: its worst when you get sick
[03/01/2005 09:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't get sick
[03/01/2005 09:58 PM] EricGFoehner: my mom does everything she can to make my life as good as possible, she says im her pride and joy and that her kids are the only thing that keep her going, and im always such a smartass to her because i cant think positively and it makes her feel bad, and she doesn't even want to come over here anymore to see me
[03/01/2005 09:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am sorry
[03/01/2005 09:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know you are a good person, and so does she
[03/01/2005 09:59 PM] EricGFoehner: no im not 
[03/01/2005 10:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can't make you any better than you already are, all i can do is make suggestions, and surrounding yourself with loving people is the best thing you can do
[03/01/2005 10:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: either way you will always have me here for you
[03/01/2005 10:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: even though i piss you off sometimes
[03/01/2005 10:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i will always be here for you
[03/01/2005 10:00 PM] EricGFoehner: unless i don't go to some dumb band function and you blow up in my face 
[03/01/2005 10:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just thought you would want the opportunity to socialize with loving friends
[03/01/2005 10:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe encourage Brianna to go even though she is sick
[03/01/2005 10:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't want to see you waste away alone all the time
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's why i push you so much
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] EricGFoehner: whose loving friends?
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: me, Erika, Alfred, Jeffrey, Daniel
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: tons of people
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: daniel wasn't there tho
[03/01/2005 10:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: but he is a loving friend
[03/01/2005 10:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is the attention he gets from you and everybody that he loves
[03/01/2005 10:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: keep that in mind next time you pick on him
[03/01/2005 10:04 PM] EricGFoehner: i know i really fucked up with my friends but it takes two people to have a friendship and you are the only one who tries to be my friend 
[03/01/2005 10:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: then you try first, practice your conversational skills while it is still easy
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: Alfred is always there to talk to
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: even though he isn't always the most interesting person
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: one conversation leads to another
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: and pulls in more people
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: and more relationships
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: its all a chain
[03/01/2005 10:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: 1 little link can connect every other link together
[03/01/2005 10:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: nice analogy huh?
[03/01/2005 10:06 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/01/2005 10:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: try not to think about it, but don't hold back the tears
[03/01/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: i went without crying for 4 years too, then one day they just all poured out
[03/01/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: now i can finally see again
[03/01/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: not trying too look through all those tears i held back
[03/01/2005 10:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: i talked to Katie a lot tonight, i hardly ever talk to her
[03/01/2005 10:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: we can figure this out
[03/01/2005 10:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: its just a bump
[03/01/2005 10:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't be upset
[03/01/2005 10:08 PM] EricGFoehner: a life changing bump

[03/13/2005 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: which is what 
[03/13/2005 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: you hardly talk to me anymore, Brianna and Erika hardly talk anymore
[03/13/2005 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: they went and did something saturday 
[03/13/2005 10:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: not to mention how much Brianna and I do NOT get along
[03/13/2005 10:22 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[03/13/2005 10:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: i am going to lay out my plans and if you want to participate let me know
[03/13/2005 10:23 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[03/13/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: first i want to rent a "cab" from Transtyle which is a 5 start cab and escort service
[03/13/2005 10:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: they have all nice cars not taxi cars
[03/13/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: like Lincolns and Mercedes and really nice bigger cars
[03/13/2005 10:25 PM] EricGFoehner: nice 
[03/13/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: i want to take her to dinner at a Marriott restaurant
[03/13/2005 10:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: the Blue Sage is the southwestern place we got our food when my dad was here last summer
[03/13/2005 10:26 PM] EricGFoehner: southwestern food, for a southwestern prom 
[03/13/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: the Meritage Steakhouse is the club house restaurant it has the best stake you or I will ever have
[03/13/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i have heard
[03/13/2005 10:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: the Tuscany is Italian, it would be really great even though you don't like Italian
[03/13/2005 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: this is all in the marriott 
[03/13/2005 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[03/13/2005 10:28 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[03/13/2005 10:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: the last is Roy's
[03/13/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: i wasn't sure about that because it is Hawaiian
[03/13/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: it will be hard to order
[03/13/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: and expensive
[03/13/2005 10:29 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[03/13/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: then we will go to the dance
[03/13/2005 10:31 PM] EricGFoehner: then after the dance, eh? 
[03/13/2005 10:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: then the driver takes us home
[03/13/2005 10:32 PM] EricGFoehner: so what does the driver do while you are eating and at the dance 
[03/13/2005 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: actually
[03/13/2005 10:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: if we have the driver wait it will probably cost more
[03/13/2005 10:32 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/13/2005 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: but at the marriott they have Transtyles right there
[03/13/2005 10:33 PM] EricGFoehner: whats that
[03/13/2005 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: so if we have then call for a specific kind of car that might work
[03/13/2005 10:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: *them
[03/13/2005 10:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: so what do you think?
[03/13/2005 10:36 PM] EricGFoehner: about a driver 
[03/13/2005 10:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: about my plans
[03/13/2005 10:36 PM] EricGFoehner: sounds good
[03/13/2005 10:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: it will cost a lot
[03/13/2005 10:37 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[03/13/2005 10:45 PM] EricGFoehner: so you will do you thing and i will do mine and maybe we will meet up at the dance
[03/13/2005 10:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: i suppose if that's the way you want it to be
[03/13/2005 10:45 PM] EricGFoehner: that's the way you want it to be 
[03/13/2005 10:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i am willing to allow Erika and Brianna together that night just for comfort
[03/13/2005 10:46 PM] EricGFoehner: talk to erika and see what she wants to do 
[03/13/2005 10:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: because they are lower classmen and there probably won't be very many there at the dance
[03/13/2005 10:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: and you talk to Brianna
[03/13/2005 10:47 PM] EricGFoehner: i don't want anyone to be uncomfortable 
[03/13/2005 10:47 PM] EricGFoehner: it has to be a trouble free night 
[03/13/2005 10:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: that is true
[03/13/2005 10:50 PM] EricGFoehner: ok, i am off to bed,

[03/15/2005 08:22 PM] EricGFoehner: you have a couple of ideas 
[03/15/2005 08:22 PM] Me: oh
[03/15/2005 08:22 PM] Me: you could pick us up in the altima
[03/15/2005 08:23 PM] EricGFoehner: and the other 
[03/15/2005 08:23 PM] Me: and we could go to coyote grill it is even better
[03/15/2005 08:23 PM] Me: well?
[03/15/2005 08:24 PM] EricGFoehner: whats the coyote grill 
[03/15/2005 08:24 PM] Me: coyote grill is like a southwestern place
[03/15/2005 08:24 PM] Me: better than the meritage
[03/15/2005 08:24 PM] Me: and you could pick us u[
[03/15/2005 08:24 PM] Me: since you have a nice car
[03/15/2005 08:26 PM] EricGFoehner: today erika said to brianna if we don't drive with you you would go with someone else
[03/15/2005 08:26 PM] EricGFoehner: trye?
[03/15/2005 08:26 PM] EricGFoehner: true?
[03/15/2005 08:27 PM] Me: we might, there are plenty of little groups to pick from
[03/15/2005 08:27 PM] EricGFoehner: likw who?
[03/15/2005 08:27 PM] EricGFoehner: like 
[03/15/2005 08:27 PM] Me: i want her to be comfortable there, there might not be very many lower classmen, so i asked eric johnson what he and andrew were planning
[03/15/2005 08:28 PM] Me: its nothing personal
[03/15/2005 08:28 PM] Me: i and just trying to give her options
[03/15/2005 08:28 PM] EricGFoehner: it sounds to me like she just doesn't want to be alone with you 
[03/15/2005 08:28 PM] EricGFoehner: if you are going to ditch us just because we don't want to ride in the same car 
[03/15/2005 08:29 PM] Me: but saying "we will drive seperately" when i have already laid out this great plan, made it sound like you neither of you were very enthusiastic about going together
[03/15/2005 08:29 PM] EricGFoehner: well we are just trying to make our women comfortable 
[03/15/2005 08:30 PM] Me: and no, it is not that she doesn't want to be alone with me, it is that i am trying to make her feel comfortable and she sees that and is trying to help figure out what to do
[03/15/2005 08:30 PM] Me: so then Brianna doesn't really want to go together?
[03/15/2005 08:30 PM] Me: what was she whispering to you in that so childish manner this morning
[03/15/2005 08:31 PM] Me: then Erika went and did the same thing, i was kind of embarrassed
[03/15/2005 08:31 PM] EricGFoehner: what?
[03/15/2005 08:31 PM] EricGFoehner: i was discussing it with her 
[03/15/2005 08:31 PM] Me: she is so quiet if we were trying to make plans together shouldn't we all be able to hear her suggestions?
[03/15/2005 08:32 PM] Me: the you turned to me and said "we will go separately and meet there"
[03/15/2005 08:32 PM] EricGFoehner: i was just asking her what she wanted 
[03/15/2005 08:32 PM] Me: so what did she say?
[03/15/2005 08:32 PM] Me: ok, if you say so
[03/15/2005 08:33 PM] EricGFoehner: that its pointless to go in the same car because we all live far apart 
[03/15/2005 08:33 PM] Me: not you Brianna and Erika
[03/15/2005 08:33 PM] EricGFoehner: and there are the dumb pictures in front of the house and everything 
[03/15/2005 08:33 PM] Me: you all live pretty close together, and that is away from me
[03/15/2005 08:33 PM] Me: and this Coyote grill place is just down the street
[03/15/2005 08:34 PM] Me: it really would be more worthwhile than a marriott restaurant
[03/15/2005 08:34 PM] EricGFoehner: ok, that's fine 
[03/15/2005 08:35 PM] Me: Erika does think Brianna wants to go together
[03/15/2005 08:35 PM] Me: that's what she whispered to me this morning before we removed ourselves
[03/15/2005 08:36 PM] EricGFoehner: does together mean in the same car 
[03/15/2005 08:36 PM] Me: according to her
[03/15/2005 08:37 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[03/15/2005 08:41 PM] EricGFoehner: i got my tux today

[03/17/2005 06:18 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[03/17/2005 06:19 PM] EricGFoehner: well all you have to do is not make any condensing remarks towards me or Brianna and we will be fine

[03/17/2005 06:21 PM] Me: if she is going to act that way i might as well treat her that way
[03/17/2005 06:21 PM] EricGFoehner: i try to get her out of her shell

[03/17/2005 06:37 PM] Me: how come pete is a prick now?

[03/17/2005 06:37 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, and he thinks he knows everything, and he only cares about his kids and doesn't give a shit about viki's

[03/17/2005 06:38 PM] EricGFoehner: everything 
[03/17/2005 06:38 PM] Me: does that mean he knows about your intimacies as well?
[03/17/2005 06:38 PM] Me: if so how did he find out about that stuff?
[03/17/2005 06:39 PM] EricGFoehner: everything, in reference to education

[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: so why don't you ask sometime why they didn't invite you
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: very casually
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: parents like it when kids talk
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] EricGFoehner: because i was kicked out of their house 
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: especially ones that are dating their daughters
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: oh
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] Me: that i didn't know
[03/17/2005 06:40 PM] EricGFoehner: for a week

[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] EricGFoehner: the week is almost up 
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] Me: its going to be hard to repair that, but it is possible
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] Me: they still won't be as close
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] EricGFoehner: repair what 
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] EricGFoehner: huh?
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] Me: your relationship with the parents
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] EricGFoehner: oh yeah, they can suck my balls 
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] Me: it has to be just as strong and trusting as your relationship with Brianna
[03/17/2005 06:41 PM] Me: Eric!

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:EricGFoehner): Thu Mar 17 18:55:16 2005
[03/17/2005 06:55 PM] Me: how convenient for them to plan this party and ban you from their house at the same time
[03/17/2005 06:55 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[03/17/2005 06:56 PM] Me: Brianna's mom doesn't realize that by sheltering her it is just going to make her want to rebel more
[03/17/2005 06:56 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, her moms actions pretty much made Brianna hate her 
[03/17/2005 06:56 PM] EricGFoehner: she treats her like a little girl 
[03/17/2005 06:57 PM] EricGFoehner: she cant let go 
[03/17/2005 06:57 PM] Me: some of the thing i can understand, like being protective of her precious daughter, but her mom really is a nut
[03/17/2005 06:57 PM] Me: EricGFoehner: she treats her like a little girl 
[03/17/2005 06:57 PM] Me: i guess i know why she acts like it now
[03/17/2005 06:57 PM] Me: around me at least
[03/17/2005 06:58 PM] Me: that will change
[03/17/2005 06:58 PM] Me: her mom probably won't though
[03/17/2005 06:58 PM] Me: if she is this into it now
[03/17/2005 06:58 PM] EricGFoehner: she really needs help 
[03/17/2005 06:58 PM] Me: she isn't the only one
[03/17/2005 06:59 PM] EricGFoehner: who else? 
[03/17/2005 06:59 PM] Me: you two shouldn't have been kissing, what if one of her siblings walked by and told, your punishment would have been even worse
[03/17/2005 07:00 PM] Me: you should feel lucky that it was pete
[03/17/2005 07:00 PM] EricGFoehner: they wouldn't tell 
[03/17/2005 07:00 PM] EricGFoehner: maybe lindsey would 
[03/17/2005 07:01 PM] Me: lindsey definitely would
[03/17/2005 07:01 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah, shes a bitch 
[03/17/2005 07:01 PM] Me: yeah annoying
[03/17/2005 07:01 PM] EricGFoehner: she treats brianna like shit, and brianna is the one who gets in trouble for it 
[03/17/2005 07:01 PM] *** BrianJCullinan wants to directly connect.
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] Me: sry
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] Me: that sucks
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] EricGFoehner: was that an accident?
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] Me: yeah
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] EricGFoehner: the direct connect?
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] Me: yeah
[03/17/2005 07:02 PM] EricGFoehner: k

[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] EricGFoehner: shes trying to call me to invite me 
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] EricGFoehner: she said she just forgot 
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] Me: who?
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] Me: her mom?
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] Me: if i were you i would be acting really sweet around the younger ones
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[03/17/2005 07:03 PM] Me: tell her you thought you were still on probation
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] EricGFoehner:  i should 
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] Me: and when you get there be as nice as you can to her mom and pete but be friendly with the little ones
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] EricGFoehner: its just a pity invite 
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] Me: try and get yourself into conversation with them
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] Me: yes but this gives you the opportunity to make up for your mistake
[03/17/2005 07:04 PM] EricGFoehner: what mistake 
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] Me: also, don't leave the group, talk to amanda, since it is her birthday
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] Me: kissing in her room and pete seeing you
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] Me: that was your mistake
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] Me: not pete being a dork
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] EricGFoehner: so, amanda, hows the 6th grade? 
[03/17/2005 07:05 PM] Me: no more like before she starts the unwrapping "what did you ask for your birthday?"
[03/17/2005 07:06 PM] EricGFoehner: then shed be like " what got into this cracker" 
[03/17/2005 07:06 PM] Me: yeah i'm sure

[03/17/2005 07:07 PM] Me: we used to play pool
[03/17/2005 07:07 PM] Me: i would always invite them to join us
[03/17/2005 07:07 PM] Me: i talked to lindsey
[03/17/2005 07:08 PM] EricGFoehner: she talks to me 
[03/17/2005 07:08 PM] Me: i would give her piggy back rides
[03/17/2005 07:08 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
[03/17/2005 07:08 PM] Me: shes cute
[03/17/2005 07:08 PM] EricGFoehner: unless you get on her bad side 
[03/17/2005 07:09 PM] Me: and i got in and out of it pretty easily
[03/17/2005 07:09 PM] Me: i did what ever i could to stay on the good side of Brianna's mom
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] EricGFoehner: you actually played pool with Brianna? 
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] Me: a few times
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] Me: why?
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] EricGFoehner: she has never wanted to play with me 
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] Me: it wasn't anything
[03/17/2005 07:10 PM] EricGFoehner: its just weird

[03/17/2005 07:12 PM] Me: but now since you weakened your relationship with her, you have to make up for it through someone else
[03/17/2005 07:12 PM] EricGFoehner: well she didn't have to over react in the first place 
[03/17/2005 07:12 PM] Me: doesn't matter what she did
[03/17/2005 07:12 PM] Me: all that matters is what you did

[03/17/2005 09:15 PM] EricGFoehner: what did you say to her?
[03/17/2005 09:15 PM] Me: Me:     i don't like it when people are protective of their computers  
 me:     i think it is dumb  
 erika:     y?  
 me:     they should use them however suits them best, and always be open for suggestions  
 me:     because there is always something that can make your experience better  
 erika:     lol  
 erika:     your strange  
 me:     no  
 me:     i just explore my options  
 me:     i always want more i guess  
 erika:     lol  
 me:     maybe that's why i want you  
 me:     because you're more then i would ever need  
 me:     *hug*  
 erika:     y do u say such nice things like that  
 me:     i don't know  
 me:     i guess i try to make up for all of my faults by being as nice as i can be  
 erika:     your faults?  
 erika:     just be yourself brian  
 me:     maybe you  
 me:     re just special  
 me:     i am myself  
 me:     myself is someone with faults, just like anyone else  
 me:     and myself is someone who trys to be as kind as he can  
 me:     but you mean a lot to me  
 me:     our friendship i mean  
 me:     maybe i am worried that we won't be friends after i move away  
 me:     and if i can be close to you now, then we will more likely to stay friends  
 me:     you don't think i am being myself?  
 me:     you don't think i am being sincere when i say nice things to you?  
 me:     ... then you don't trust me  
 me:     that is kind of upsetting  
 me:     we were doing so well with talking to, we talked a lot today, that makes me happy  
 erika:     what?  
 erika:     its upsetting?
[03/17/2005 09:15 PM] Me: Me:     that you don't think i am "myself", or being sincere  
 erika:     well because bradley acted all nice to me too  
 erika:     and so did chad  
 me:     who is chad?  
 erika:     so i don't know what to think  
 erika:     um...long story  
 me:     i know how you must feel  
 erika:     i don't have time to tell right now  
 me:     but look at bradly  
 me:     he is a disgrace to every gentleman everywhere  
 erika:     yeah i know  
 erika:     just act to me like u would to anyone else  
 me:     he is one of the few people i have given up on, i try to see decency in him, but it just doesn't work  
 erika:     because i can't beleave all of those nice things u say because everyone who has said things like that have been fake  
 me:     i can't treat you like i would anyone else  
 erika:     well just...idk  
 me:     i don't hug anyone else everyday  
 erika:     i know that  
 me:     i don't flirt with anyone else  
 erika:     brian i have to go sorry  
 me:     it ok  
 erika:     see you tomorrow  
 me:     don't be sorry  
 erika:     *hug*  
 me:     yes, i will see you tomorrow  
 me:     and it will be wonderful  
 me:     *hug*  
 
[03/17/2005 09:15 PM] Me: no the kind was still in the back
[03/17/2005 09:15 PM] Me: behind its soldiers
[03/17/2005 09:16 PM] Me: it was one of the pawns that fucked it up
[03/17/2005 09:17 PM] Me: this was i think the second time i brought up our relationship, the first part ended dissatisfying as usual
[03/17/2005 09:18 PM] Me: what do you think?
[03/17/2005 09:19 PM] Me: i think i messed it up here
  me:     i guess i try to make up for all of my faults by being as nice as i can be  
  erika:     your faults?  
  erika:     just be yourself brian  
  me:     maybe you  
  me:     re just special  
  me:     i am myself  
[03/17/2005 09:19 PM] Me: i should have moved up the "maybe you're just special"
[03/17/2005 09:19 PM] EricGFoehner: i could talk to her and tell her that you are being genuine 
[03/17/2005 09:20 PM] Me: lol i don't think it will help
[03/17/2005 09:20 PM] Me: she distrusts me, and this conclusion to the conversation didn't help at all
[03/17/2005 09:21 PM] EricGFoehner: maybe its not you, maybe she just doesn't trust guys anymore 
[03/17/2005 09:21 PM] Me: i thought that with "me:     i guess i try to make up for all of my faults by being as nice as i can be" would show her that i was self conscious and could admit my faults
[03/17/2005 09:22 PM] EricGFoehner: but also that you were trying to hard to cover them up with compliments to her 
[03/17/2005 09:22 PM] Me: yes very right
[03/17/2005 09:22 PM] Me: that is the side she saw
[03/17/2005 09:22 PM] Me: and you spotted it before I
[03/17/2005 09:23 PM] Me: so now i have the decision to press on and try to convince her that i am in every way sincere, or to retreat and mourn and wait for her to come to me
[03/17/2005 09:23 PM] Me: neither way is more or less depressing at this point
[03/17/2005 09:24 PM] EricGFoehner: im sorry 
[03/17/2005 09:25 PM] Me: i think the next thing i should say is "sorry about our conversation ending on a bad note the other night, i don't want you to think about"
[03/17/2005 09:25 PM] Me: that would be a retreat
[03/17/2005 09:25 PM] Me: i have crossed the line tonight
[03/17/2005 09:25 PM] EricGFoehner: what line 
[03/17/2005 09:26 PM] Me: the line that could cause her to be pushed further away from me
[03/17/2005 09:26 PM] Me: not closer
[03/17/2005 09:26 PM] EricGFoehner: maybe things will go great in mexico 
[03/17/2005 09:27 PM] Me: thanks for being optimistic
[03/17/2005 09:27 PM] EricGFoehner: you can spand lots of time together and have lots of fun 
[03/17/2005 09:27 PM] EricGFoehner: spend 
[03/17/2005 09:27 PM] Me: but they could also be terrible
[03/17/2005 09:27 PM] EricGFoehner: in mexico?
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: i mean the trip
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: could be
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: bad
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: ...
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] EricGFoehner: if you think it will be, it just might end up that way 
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: you're right again
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: it will be great
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: with or without her
[03/17/2005 09:28 PM] Me: it will be fun
[03/17/2005 09:29 PM] Me: scott will be there
[03/17/2005 09:29 PM] Me: we are going to give each other shit the whole time
[03/17/2005 09:29 PM] Me: it will be great

[03/24/2005 04:53 PM] Me: how come people buy coins for more than they are really worth?  all they did was keep something the government made in a box for a long time
[03/24/2005 04:53 PM] Me: now about servers
[03/24/2005 04:54 PM] Me: would it be worth while to start copying DVDs?

[03/24/2005 04:54 PM] Me: you really think so?
[03/24/2005 04:55 PM] Me: or should i just make backups?
[03/24/2005 04:55 PM] Me: it would probably be cheaper
[03/24/2005 04:55 PM] Me: because they are about 5.5 gigs a piece
[03/24/2005 04:56 PM] Me: see my point?

[03/24/2005 05:14 PM] Me: would you be able to come over before then?
[03/24/2005 05:15 PM] EricGFoehner: maybe

[03/24/2005 05:18 PM] EricGFoehner: what is it you have to do?
[03/24/2005 05:18 PM] Me: the way i download them is...
[03/24/2005 05:18 PM] Me: i open up all four windows at the same time
[03/24/2005 05:19 PM] Me: then i right click and save each four pictures
[03/24/2005 05:19 PM] Me: then close the 4 windows
[03/24/2005 05:19 PM] Me: the do the next set
[03/24/2005 05:19 PM] EricGFoehner: so you have to do them all manually 
[03/24/2005 05:19 PM] Me: yes
[03/24/2005 05:20 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
[03/24/2005 05:20 PM] Me: sucks huh?
[03/24/2005 05:20 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/24/2005 05:23 PM] Me: yeah no program i have will download just the pictures i want
[03/24/2005 05:23 PM] Me: maybe i should just discontinue it
[03/24/2005 05:24 PM] Me: but that would irritate me
[03/24/2005 05:24 PM] Me: i wouldn't be able to sleep at night
[03/24/2005 05:24 PM] EricGFoehner: would it be faster to download all of it and just delete the stuff you don't want 
[03/24/2005 05:25 PM] Me: no because it will download the thousands of pictures i already have
[03/24/2005 05:25 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[03/24/2005 05:25 PM] Me: and the site has some kind of security, i can't just make a list of the pictures and download them
[03/24/2005 05:26 PM] Me: they can only be opened from the server
[03/24/2005 05:27 PM] Me: its weird
[03/24/2005 05:27 PM] Me: it makes me angry
[03/24/2005 05:27 PM] EricGFoehner: oh

[03/24/2005 05:28 PM] EricGFoehner: but she has been laying down all day 
[03/24/2005 05:28 PM] EricGFoehner: she is sick 
[03/24/2005 05:29 PM] Me: ah i c
[03/24/2005 05:30 PM] EricGFoehner: it seems like shes always sick 
[03/24/2005 05:30 PM] Me: maybe it is psychological
[03/24/2005 05:31 PM] EricGFoehner: sometimes maybe 
[03/24/2005 05:45 PM] Me: how is that download coming?

[03/24/2005 05:51 PM] EricGFoehner: because she talked like a mouse with a stuffy nose 
[03/24/2005 05:51 PM] EricGFoehner: i couldn't hear

[03/24/2005 06:05 PM] EricGFoehner: cool
[03/24/2005 06:07 PM] Me: now i don't need your help
[03/24/2005 06:07 PM] Me: i can keep them all up to date
[03/24/2005 06:07 PM] Me: and i should sell the collection
[03/24/2005 06:07 PM] Me: because the douche bag hosting all these pictures wont sell them
[03/24/2005 06:07 PM] Me: how is that download coming?

[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] Me: are you on your moms account?
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] EricGFoehner: how much is yours?
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] Me: i think mine is around there too
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] Me: not sure
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] Me: oh yeah and that website you found with the house values on it
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] Me: remember that one?
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/30/2005 11:11 PM] EricGFoehner: what about it 
[03/30/2005 11:12 PM] Me: that isn't the price you could actually sell your house for
[03/30/2005 11:12 PM] EricGFoehner: seemed low 
[03/30/2005 11:12 PM] Me: that is how much the government thinks your house it worth
[03/30/2005 11:12 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[03/30/2005 11:12 PM] EricGFoehner: but they're worth a lot more 
[03/30/2005 11:13 PM] Me: because to update it, they have to send out realtors all across the county and update the value of everyone's house at the same time
[03/30/2005 11:13 PM] Me: its about the taxes i mean
[03/30/2005 11:13 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[03/30/2005 11:13 PM] Me: they would update the value of the houses so that people have to pay different amounts of taxes
[03/30/2005 11:13 PM] Me: that's why they have to do it all at once
[03/30/2005 11:14 PM] Me: and it is very costly, so they havent don't it for a while and won't do it for a while
[03/30/2005 11:14 PM] Me: for example our house was 436,000 or something
[03/30/2005 11:14 PM] Me: we pay property tax on that number
[03/30/2005 11:14 PM] Me: even though when we go to sell our house we will sell it for 700,000 some thousand
[03/30/2005 11:14 PM] EricGFoehner: wow
[03/30/2005 11:15 PM] Me: but if they haven't updated the value according to what the realtors sell the house for, the next owner will still only pay taxes on the 436,000
[03/30/2005 11:15 PM] Me: understand?
[03/30/2005 11:15 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah
[03/30/2005 11:15 PM] Me: it turns out that it sucks to be mayer
[03/30/2005 11:15 PM] Me: of a county
[03/30/2005 11:16 PM] EricGFoehner: why
[03/30/2005 11:16 PM] Me: because the government could be making more money on property tax, but it would cost them so much to consult each realtor and update the value, that they only do it about every ten years
[03/30/2005 11:17 PM] Me: i would hate to have to make such a big decision
[03/30/2005 11:17 PM] EricGFoehner: with the census 
[03/30/2005 11:17 PM] EricGFoehner: ?
[03/30/2005 11:17 PM] Me: yeah

[04/06/2005 12:35 PM] EricGFoehner: you think i like having her cry over everything 
[04/06/2005 12:35 PM] Me: i didn't actually say "I wish you break up" in the snotty, bratty, tone that she always speaks to me with
[04/06/2005 12:36 PM] EricGFoehner: you know how worried she is about losing me, that's what most of her dreams are about 
[04/06/2005 12:36 PM] Me: i didn't care to hear what she had to say, so i shook my head and agreed, she isn't the one going away to college with me, YOU ARE, i was speaking to YOU, i didn't need her to be a snot to me just like she usually is
[04/06/2005 12:36 PM] Me: i don't care how worried she is
[04/06/2005 12:37 PM] Me: why does it matter?

[04/06/2005 12:37 PM] Me: if things don't work out, if you two DON'T spend the rest of your lives together, it just means there is someone better out there for you

[04/06/2005 12:38 PM] Me: i have to go eat lunch and go to work, i don't have time to listen to these little sympathy stories, i doubt she has dreams about losing you, shes making it up just to get attention, shes more controlling than you think
[04/06/2005 12:39 PM] Me: it would be easier for me to stay out of it, if you didn't hit me everytime she feels like acting like a baby

[04/07/2005 10:26 PM] Me: a router is about $40
[04/07/2005 10:26 PM] Me: so that's only 2 months your out instead of getting a new cox service

 And all I can taste is this moment 
 And all I can breathe is your life 
 Cause sooner or later it's over 
 I just don't want to miss you tonight 
 Chorus 
  
 And I don't want the world to see me 
 Cause I don't think that they'd understand 
 When everything's made to be broken 
 I just want you to know who I am 
 Verse 3 
  
 And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming 
 Or the moment of truth in your lies 
 When everything seems like the movies 
 Yeah you bleed just to know your alive 
  
 Chorus 
  
 And I don't want the world to see me 
 Cause I don't think that they'd understand 
 When everything's made to be broken 
 I just want you to know who I am 
 Chorus 
  
 I don't want the world to see me 
 Cause I don't think that they'd understand 
 When everything's made to be broken 
 I just want you to know who I am 
  
 I just want you to know who I am 
 I just want you to know who I am 
 I just want you to know who I am 
 I just want you to know who I am

[06/12/2005 01:55 PM] EricGFoehner: its a credit union 
[06/12/2005 01:55 PM] Me: anywho, do what you like, but bank of america would have no problem giving you free checking
[06/12/2005 01:56 PM] Me: and you shouldn't have to pay for the saving either with that kind of money
[06/12/2005 01:56 PM] EricGFoehner: whats the interest like

[06/12/2005 01:58 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[06/12/2005 01:58 PM] Me: but what ever you do, DON'T LET THEM TACK ON EXTRA CHARGES
[06/12/2005 01:59 PM] Me: they will try it, some of them are even automatic and all you have to do is call them on it, and they will take them off
[06/12/2005 01:59 PM] Me: they tried to bill my free checking 3 years in a row
[06/12/2005 01:59 PM] Me: didn't work!

[06/12/2005 01:59 PM] Me: we called them, they credited my account and no more charges
[06/12/2005 02:00 PM] Me: my parents have a lot of money saved in bank of america, so every other sub-account is free
[06/12/2005 02:00 PM] EricGFoehner: cool 
[06/12/2005 02:00 PM] Me: good stuff
[06/12/2005 02:00 PM] Me: you might be able to get checking through desert schools though

[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: we need to rank our list
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] EricGFoehner: right now 
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: i don't know where to start
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: sometime
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] EricGFoehner: sorry, bold was on 
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: someday
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: i didn't notice
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] Me: i turned off text formatting
[06/27/2005 12:32 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[06/27/2005 12:33 PM] Me: so
[06/27/2005 12:33 PM] Me: about the list
[06/27/2005 12:33 PM] Me: if i rank it you are just gonna disagree anyways
[06/27/2005 12:34 PM] Me: that's why we have to do it together
[06/27/2005 12:34 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[06/27/2005 12:36 PM] Me: i added over the hills and far away by zeppelin
[06/27/2005 12:36 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[06/27/2005 12:38 PM] Me: so i figured out how we can both use your surround
[06/27/2005 12:38 PM] EricGFoehner: how
[06/27/2005 12:38 PM] Me: we use the splitters but then reverse it
[06/27/2005 12:39 PM] Me: and we need to figure out what to do about TV
[06/27/2005 12:39 PM] EricGFoehner: what do we need to figure out 
[06/27/2005 12:39 PM] Me: if we have 4 that's going to be an awfully weak signat
[06/27/2005 12:40 PM] Me: remember you said that when another TV is turned on the picture is slightly faded on both
[06/27/2005 12:40 PM] Me: is there 2 coaxial outlets in each room?
[06/27/2005 12:41 PM] EricGFoehner: i think one 
[06/27/2005 12:42 PM] EricGFoehner: but they have more than 2 way splitters 
[06/27/2005 12:42 PM] Me: yeah that might be a problem
[06/27/2005 12:42 PM] Me: yeah but even with splitters the signal fades i believe
[06/27/2005 12:42 PM] EricGFoehner: well no room is going to have 4 outlets 
[06/27/2005 12:43 PM] Me: so maybe if either you or i is recording a show then no other tvs should be on, but any other time is ok
[06/27/2005 12:43 PM] Me: like you record all the south parks
[06/27/2005 12:44 PM] Me: maybe we shouldn't rank the songs, just make sure the awesomer songs are equally spread out
[06/27/2005 12:44 PM] Me: because Eye of The Tiger would have to be the no. 1 song
[06/27/2005 12:45 PM] EricGFoehner: why
[06/27/2005 12:45 PM] Me: because its awesome
[06/27/2005 12:45 PM] Me: what do you think the first song should be?

[06/27/2005 02:26 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[06/27/2005 02:26 PM] Me: what if i started an ice cream truck business around arizona
[06/27/2005 02:27 PM] Me: and played ice cream man by van halen in all of them
[06/27/2005 02:27 PM] EricGFoehner: lol 
[06/27/2005 02:27 PM] Me: and then got trucks with reinforced roofs so if a customer tips he will dance on the top with a mic singing that song
[06/27/2005 02:27 PM] Me: i haven't seen an ice cream truck since i lived in ohio
[06/27/2005 02:28 PM] Me: and it is way hotter hear
[06/27/2005 02:28 PM] EricGFoehner: wow 
[06/27/2005 02:28 PM] Me: probably because home owners associations won't allow passage through their neighborhoods
[06/27/2005 02:30 PM] Me: i think that's it
[06/27/2005 02:30 PM] Me: i should start and ice cream truck business
[06/27/2005 02:30 PM] Me: and do nothing but grow and grow and grow
[06/27/2005 02:30 PM] Me: until it is covered across the country
[06/27/2005 02:32 PM] Me: then after they are done playing that song they will show their collection of cheap sunglasses and play that song
[06/27/2005 02:32 PM] Me: ice cream and sunglasses to shade oneself from the sun
[06/27/2005 02:32 PM] Me: now i just need to find a song about hats

I'm not some pushover that will do whatever you say, i will make my own decisions. I choose to stay with Brianna, i want to, and i don't want another girl. I will meet new people and do fun things, but im not going to leave Brianna. This is something i must do, to see if it works out. if i just quit now, ill never know, and i cant do that. ive never quit anything ive ever started, and im not going to do that now.  you will tolerate it if i want to stay in one night instead of going out to have a good time and you will tolerate me visiting her and her visiting me and it wont be every weekend. you don't have to like any of it but if you are a friend you will respect it, and support it .
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Me: good
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Me: do what you want
[06/28/2005 11:08 PM] Me: did i ever say anything different?
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] EricGFoehner: and i am not going to tolerate him staying in the dorm talking to you online all of the time.  he will be out doing stuff, meeting people, having fun, maybe even find another girl, and weather you like it or not he is not going to come to phoenix every weekend to see you despite the fact that he has a car
[06/28/2005 11:09 PM] Me: the problem i have is that you have already made up you mind before it has happened
[06/28/2005 11:10 PM] Me: you have already decided that you will try to be with her forever when you have not lived forever
[06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Me: what makes you think you won't find someone else? <-- that goes for both of you, just incase she didn't already send that to you
[06/28/2005 11:27 PM] Me: so i picked out a different laptop

[06/28/2005 11:43 PM] Me: you are too
[06/28/2005 11:43 PM] EricGFoehner: of what?
[06/28/2005 11:43 PM] Me: leaving her
[06/28/2005 11:44 PM] Me: [06/28/2005 11:11 PM] Brianna: there is no one else
 
 yeah that's mature
[06/28/2005 11:45 PM] EricGFoehner: ?
[06/28/2005 11:45 PM] Me: there is no one else in the world?
[06/28/2005 11:45 PM] Me: there are a lot of fish in the sea
[06/28/2005 11:46 PM] Me: people like you and her put so much pressure on "going out"
[06/28/2005 11:46 PM] Me: why do you do this?
[06/28/2005 11:46 PM] Me: you can be "seeing" eachother
[06/28/2005 11:47 PM] Me: you might be seeing more then one person
[06/28/2005 11:47 PM] Me: then you leave opportunity open to find the best match
[06/28/2005 11:47 PM] Me: it doesn't make any sense
[06/28/2005 11:47 PM] Me: i used to think like you
[06/28/2005 11:47 PM] EricGFoehner: hows that 
[06/28/2005 11:48 PM] Me: but i opened my eyes to other possibilities and realized that there was a better way of showing your affection for other people
[06/28/2005 11:48 PM] Me: i used to think that i wanted to be with a girl forever
[06/28/2005 11:48 PM] Me: and i was younger then i am now.  how pathetic is that?  i had made up my mind about someone
[06/28/2005 11:49 PM] Me: i told Brianna i wanted to be with her forever
[06/28/2005 11:49 PM] Me: she said the same things
[06/28/2005 11:49 PM] Me: look how that turned out!
[06/28/2005 11:49 PM] Me: not being with her is not really that bad, we had our time, it was fun, now we have both moved on
[06/28/2005 11:50 PM] Me: but you have already decided that will never happen to you
[06/28/2005 11:50 PM] Me: i never said in our conversation with her that i wanted your relationship to fail
[06/28/2005 11:51 PM] Me: and i don't, i never want to see you hurt
[06/28/2005 11:51 PM] Me: because i know how it feels, we all do
[06/28/2005 11:51 PM] Me: but you can avoid it by realizing that someday it could happen, and probably will
[06/28/2005 11:51 PM] Me: if you realize that ahead of time, then down the road it will make things so much easier for you
[06/28/2005 11:53 PM] Me: you are already beginning to understand just be reading this, even if you don't know it
[06/28/2005 11:54 PM] Me: but don't be afraid, everything is going to work out if you let it, sit back and relax, enjoy life, stop worrying about making sure you two are together forever by seeing each other contantly
[06/28/2005 11:55 PM] Me: what happens will happen, shit happens but you always feel so much better afterwards, after you dump your load, you feel lighter, that's what that phrase really means, lol

[06/29/2005 12:02 AM] Me: because that's not the way developers think.  When we see something we don't think "Hey this is nice, i can really use this" we think "Hey this is nice, how can i make this work better for me"

[06/30/2005 03:03 PM] EricGFoehner: it was pretty intense 
[06/30/2005 03:04 PM] EricGFoehner: i just didn't like the whole they were buried on earth for millions of years thing 
[06/30/2005 03:04 PM] EricGFoehner: makes no sense 
[06/30/2005 03:04 PM] Me: yeah
[06/30/2005 03:05 PM] EricGFoehner: but he couldn't do it like the book because it would take to long 
[06/30/2005 03:05 PM] Me: how did they really get there?
[06/30/2005 03:05 PM] EricGFoehner: they came down in cylinders and make the tripods from the cylinders 
[06/30/2005 03:06 PM] EricGFoehner: and they couldn't get out of the pit because of earths gravity 
[06/30/2005 03:06 PM] EricGFoehner: so it took them awhile to build the machines 
[06/30/2005 03:08 PM] EricGFoehner: but it was pretty similar to the book, it was just from a different perspective 
[06/30/2005 03:08 PM] Me: really?
[06/30/2005 03:09 PM] Me: the book was from the alien perspective?
[06/30/2005 03:09 PM] Me: or you mean speilbergs perspective?
[06/30/2005 03:09 PM] EricGFoehner: no, it was a narrator in the book without a name and his brother 
[06/30/2005 03:10 PM] Me: ah
[06/30/2005 03:10 PM] EricGFoehner: but the whole dad with kids thing made it more interesting

[07/26/2005 02:56 PM] Me: whats that about?
[07/26/2005 02:57 PM] EricGFoehner: A washed-up ballplayer is put in charge of a pack of kids scarcely more mature than himself in this remake of the 1976 comedy hit. Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a former major league baseball player whose career and life has hit the skids thanks to his overwhelming fondness for booze and women. Needing a break, his lawyer (Marcia Gay Harden) arranges for Buttermaker to take on coaching responsibilities for the Bears, a Little League baseball team comprised of a handful of hapless losers. As Buttermaker tries to groom his young charges into a winning team, he also gives them a glimpse of his hard-living lifestyle while they gear up to take on perennial rivals the Yankees and their arrogant Coach Bullock (Greg Kinnear. The 2005 version of The Bad News Bears was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who previously scripted another Billy Bob Thornton vehicle, Bad Santa. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide

[07/26/2005 03:13 PM] Me: and the wedding crashers would be a good movie for you to take Brianna to and for me to find a girl to take
[07/26/2005 03:13 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[07/26/2005 03:13 PM] Me: so we could see the island
[07/26/2005 03:14 PM] Me: and then i could leave my car at your house afterwards and we could go, because we will already be half way there

[07/26/2005 03:16 PM] Me: we can take my car if you want

[07/31/2005 01:20 PM] EricGFoehner: Brian 
[07/31/2005 01:20 PM] Me: What are we going to do about movies?
[07/31/2005 01:21 PM] Me: Should i copy all the ones i have?
[07/31/2005 01:21 PM] Me: because its taking me an hour a piece.
[07/31/2005 01:21 PM] Me: and i don't have very many days left
[07/31/2005 01:21 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[07/31/2005 01:22 PM] Me: if you were to assist me in the process we might be able to get them all copied
[07/31/2005 01:22 PM] EricGFoehner: how am i going to help 
[07/31/2005 01:22 PM] Me: i would give you what you need to copy them and you just do one after the other
[07/31/2005 01:24 PM] EricGFoehner: how much space does one movie take up?
[07/31/2005 01:25 PM] Me: well about 8GB until you compress it then it is 12GB then you can delete the 8GB and burn the 4GB and delete the 4GB and be back to none
[07/31/2005 01:26 PM] EricGFoehner: why does it go to 8 from 12 when you compress it 
[07/31/2005 01:29 PM] Me: no it goes from 8 to 12
[07/31/2005 01:29 PM] Me: because you have 8GB of movie
[07/31/2005 01:29 PM] Me: then you add on the compressed which is 8GB
[07/31/2005 01:29 PM] Me: *4GB
[07/31/2005 01:29 PM] Me: sry
[07/31/2005 01:30 PM] Me: so you need at least 12 GB of space
[07/31/2005 01:30 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[07/31/2005 01:30 PM] EricGFoehner: then i would burn it onto a disc?
[07/31/2005 01:31 PM] Me: yes
[07/31/2005 01:31 PM] Me: i will supply the discs
[07/31/2005 01:32 PM] Me: the only problem is it is very CPU consuming, so you wouldn't be able to do much except listen to music and talk online
[07/31/2005 01:32 PM] EricGFoehner: oh
[07/31/2005 01:38 PM] Me: my buffer on this one is going nuts

[07/31/2005 01:53 PM] EricGFoehner: that would be cool 
[07/31/2005 01:54 PM] Me: with many external drives you can use the same drive between two computers at the same time
[07/31/2005 01:55 PM] Me: they can be unplugged and moved around anytime
[07/31/2005 01:56 PM] EricGFoehner: cool

[08/01/2005 12:42 AM] EricGFoehner: why would you want to go to one?

[08/01/2005 12:45 AM] EricGFoehner: and not going doesn't make you any less of a man 
[08/01/2005 12:45 AM] Me: you think i am stupid
[08/01/2005 12:45 AM] Me: i am not going to get laid, i am going to have fun, and i'm taking you with me

[08/01/2005 12:46 AM] Me: look, if you don't have fun at anything we do together, i'll never ask you to do it again
[08/01/2005 12:46 AM] Me: i know that sounds strange
[08/01/2005 12:47 AM] Me: remember back when i told you to get a suvineer cup for the movies?
[08/01/2005 12:47 AM] Me: and you refused because you wanted the extra 4 ounces for an extra 3 dollars every time?
[08/01/2005 12:47 AM] EricGFoehner: how is that having fun?
[08/01/2005 12:47 AM] Me: now you have used that cup every single time
[08/01/2005 12:48 AM] Me: because you save money every single time
[08/01/2005 12:48 AM] Me: and the amount of money you save easily has paid for half the movies you have gone to see
[08/01/2005 12:48 AM] Me: you didn't even go back to the other cups after the new year, you stuck with the good ones and saved even more
[08/01/2005 12:49 AM] EricGFoehner: so i should go waste the money i saved on diseased women 
[08/01/2005 12:49 AM] Me: they get tested regularly
[08/01/2005 12:49 AM] Me: besides at least now you will have the chance to ask them if they have any diseases
[08/01/2005 12:49 AM] Me: and if it means that much to you to save the extra bucks, i'll buy you the dance
[08/01/2005 12:50 AM] EricGFoehner: i don't want it 
[08/01/2005 12:50 AM] Me: lol
[08/01/2005 12:50 AM] Me: then i will tell you about it
[08/01/2005 12:52 AM] Me: i had hopes for you man, i honestly though you were going to come out of your shell and get out and do stuff with other guys, not just your girlfriend
[08/01/2005 12:52 AM] EricGFoehner: why do you have to go to a tittie bar, why is that manly?
[08/01/2005 12:53 AM] Me: not manly just fun

Possibly the most annoying thing about bloggers is the sense of self-importance they get after even the most modest of publicity. Sometimes it takes as little as a referral on a more popular blogger's website to set the lesser blogger's ego into orbit.

[09/07/2005 04:21 PM] EricGFoehner:  
 you will narrate, describe, and make some sense out of your educational experiences. The evidence for your thesis (main idea) comes from these experiences. Narration should be used to support your thesis about your education and experiences. Consider your narrative as an argument supporting or revealing your experiences to your readers. 
  
 your paper should engage the audience by interweaving personal aspects with general interests. If your paper is too focused on yourself, it will not be of interest to others.  
 for models of narrative essays, you can read Baca, Johnson, Auster, and Paley. 
  
 
[09/07/2005 04:21 PM] EricGFoehner: Your essay should include the following parts: 
 •     Introduction: this is where you tell your readers what the narrative is about. Provide a statement of central focus (thesis) that tells your readers why you are going to discuss this specific educational experience. 
 •     Body: this is where you provide specific detail to illustrate the importance of the educational experience. You can write about people, a significant event, or anything that relates to a significant educational experience. Make sure that each of your main ideas in this essay is supported by examples or descriptive detail. 
 •     Conclusion: this is where you round up your essay and make connections to the larger world. Be sure to restate your thesis in recognition of what you wrote about in the paper.

[11/22/2005 05:42 PM] Me: This article discusses almost every aspect of the controversy between video games and violence.  It starts out by generally explaining the topic.  Then it presents some valid statistics.  It also discusses studies done by testing children playing games and their aggression levels.  It also disproves these studies and explains how they are invalid.  It also explains the social aspects.  After reviewing the bibliography it can be determined that this is a very valid resource and the research has been done to make the information on this page valid.  The audience of this article is probably anyone looking for an answer to the problem.  The author of this article has definitely put in the research to find the answer to these implications and questions about video game violence.  The author is a Ph. D.

[11/28/2005 05:30 PM] EricGFoehner: This webpage is designed so that I will hopefully pass English 105. I believe no student would make such a site out of their own free will. In this website you will find a bunch of nonsensical information about my essays I had to do for the course and how it helped me become a better learner. You will see excerpts from each of my six essays and a reflection about each excerpt. You will be enlightened by finding in my writings about how I advanced as a critical thinker, reader, and writer. You will see how I became literate in the world of technology and how incorporating a computer lab once a week helped me succeed.

[02/20/2006 08:21 PM] Me: i've given you so much more, every single day i let you use my bean bag, i rarely even use it, i never complain about not being able to play my game, and the only time i brought it up you snapped as if it were another verbal attack against you

[02/20/2006 08:25 PM] Me: i guess if this is how it is going to be forever then there is no hope, i just feel since the day you stole my girlfriend that i was put on this earth to be your lifelong friend.

[03/07/2006 08:15 PM] Me: this arrangement isn't healthy for either of us, you obviously have some weird unknown deep dark hatred for me that i only catch a glimpse of every one in a while, and i have focused too much of my life and energy around being there for you and including you in my life and it has all been in vain.  so please just sign the form and we can forever go our separate ways, i have given up on you, and i'm not going to put forth any more effort in being your friend.
[03/07/2006 08:17 PM] Me: its sad really, everyone has to work at having a good relationship, and after 5 years you still just simply don't care.  i only wish i could understand why we have never gotten along, we have grown through high school together, we've seen each other change and become more sociable people, and you have never accepted me as a friend
