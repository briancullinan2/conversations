[19/10/2004 06:32 PM] WG Wise Master: bout time
[19/10/2004 06:32 PM] Alfred: i just got home
[19/10/2004 06:32 PM] WG Wise Master: we have a few options to go over
[19/10/2004 06:32 PM] Alfred: ok
[19/10/2004 06:33 PM] WG Wise Master: we can go through with buying the software because its pretty nice and llegal and we have 4 people splitting it all together
[19/10/2004 06:33 PM] Alfred: ok
[19/10/2004 06:33 PM] WG Wise Master: or we can wait for my super nerd friend to get home and ask him if he knows of software to just copy the cd image
[19/10/2004 06:33 PM] WG Wise Master: which is really all we need because we found that other virtual drive manager
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] WG Wise Master: and i got that from him too
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] Alfred: ok 
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] WG Wise Master: so he probably knows of where to get other software
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] Alfred: so that program makes it so you dont need the cd right
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] Alfred: ?
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] WG Wise Master: yes the free one that i downloaded
[19/10/2004 06:34 PM] Alfred: ok
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] WG Wise Master: what it doesn't do is create the vcd or iso image file
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] Alfred: than lets do that
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] WG Wise Master: but that is pretty standard
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] WG Wise Master: just use the free one?
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] Alfred: well i think i'll buy the gamedrive for myself anyway
[19/10/2004 06:35 PM] WG Wise Master: well hold on
[19/10/2004 06:36 PM] Alfred: ok
[19/10/2004 06:36 PM] WG Wise Master: if you are just going to buy it anyways then we might as well go through with it
[19/10/2004 06:36 PM] WG Wise Master: and it is $30
[19/10/2004 06:36 PM] WG Wise Master: $8 dollars a piece
[19/10/2004 06:36 PM] Alfred: thats fine with me if we can share it
[19/10/2004 06:37 PM] Alfred: so if it works lest do it
[19/10/2004 06:37 PM] WG Wise Master: just don't buy anything quite yet

[19/10/2004 06:38 PM] Alfred: well?
[19/10/2004 06:39 PM] WG Wise Master: hold on i am testing something
[19/10/2004 06:40 PM] WG Wise Master: what i am saying is there are already a lot of free software that create iso images
[19/10/2004 06:40 PM] WG Wise Master: and that iso image combined with the free download deamon that i told you to get earlier does the same thing as that GameDrive
[19/10/2004 06:40 PM] WG Wise Master: and i think it works better anyways
[19/10/2004 06:42 PM] WG Wise Master: g2g to dinne
[19/10/2004 06:42 PM] WG Wise Master: we will talk more about it later
[19/10/2004 06:43 PM] Alfred: ok
