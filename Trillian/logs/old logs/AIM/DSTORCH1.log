What would you do if for every moment you were truly happy there would be 10 moments of sadness?  What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt?  What would you do if you loved someone more than anything else and you could never have them?  Some people live and some people die.  But I want to tell you I love you and you are a true friend...  That I will always be here for you when and if you need me...  If I died tomorrow, you would be in my heart forever.  Would I be in yours?  If you care about the person who sent this to you then you will send it back.  Please send this to all your friends...  You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next year, and don't want to talk at all the year after that.  So! , I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in
