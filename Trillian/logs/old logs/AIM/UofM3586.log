UofM3586: I hope that you liked what you did after rehersal today after school.  I have always said no matter how slow you went, I would never pass you, but if you are going 10 mph below the speed limit, then I had to pass you.  If you ever do that again, I will never give you a dollar if you need one.  That includes if you really need it.  Don't take this the wrong way.  I had a laugh out of it, but a person just can't drive that slow :)

BrianJCullinan: actually it was -15
UofM3586: oh sorry
UofM3586: 15 mph under

UofM3586: or do you have no time?
LittlePNutss: sure
LittlePNutss: i have time
LittlePNutss: talking to Andrea
UofM3586: ok
UofM3586: Hey
UofM3586: whats up?
LittlePNutss: nothing
LittlePNutss: you?
UofM3586: not much
UofM3586: so how are things going with you?
LittlePNutss: pretty good
UofM3586: to tell you the truth Brian, we really have nothing to talk about. Not just here, but also at school.  I think it is time that you and I just become friends
LittlePNutss: but we cant just be friends
LittlePNutss: we have to be best friends
LittlePNutss: see now we are talking
LittlePNutss: i'm sorry that my fault
LittlePNutss: i was talking to Andrea
LittlePNutss: i'm not good at talking to two people at once
LittlePNutss: how are you?
UofM3586: I am not talking about right now
LittlePNutss: did you have fun today?
UofM3586: like every day
UofM3586: we don't talk to each other that much
LittlePNutss: why do you have to worry about that?  you are here now, and i am trying to talk to you now
LittlePNutss: lets focus on now
LittlePNutss: not tomorrow
LittlePNutss: not yestarday
LittlePNutss: not a week ago
LittlePNutss: did you have fun at the competition?
UofM3586: yeah
UofM3586: The only reason I "worry" about this is because I dont think it is fair to say that you are my best friend when we never talk
LittlePNutss: then say i'm becoming your best friend
LittlePNutss: or i should be your best friend
LittlePNutss: then forget about being "best" you don't always have to have a best friend, we are still friends, and always will be, so lets talk about stuff now
UofM3586: ok, so just to get things in line, we are not best friends ne more
LittlePNutss: if thats the way you want it to be
UofM3586: I think it is just the right thing to do

BrianJCullinan: we are now
BrianJCullinan: oh sorry
BrianJCullinan: wrong IM
UofM3586: no I mean in person
UofM3586: ok
BrianJCullinan: can we talk now?
UofM3586: if you don't want to talk tomorrow just say so
BrianJCullinan: there is no better time then the present
BrianJCullinan: is there something you HAVE TO say?
BrianJCullinan: if there is by all means say it now
UofM3586: yeah I know, but i think that this would be better to be said in person or at least so that I can hear your voice
BrianJCullinan: then we can talk tomorrow also
UofM3586: Well I am really sorry about the way I have been acting
UofM3586: I have been a total jerk to you 
UofM3586: and I just wanted to say that I am really sorry
BrianJCullinan: you haven't been a jerk
BrianJCullinan: maybe just a little irrational
BrianJCullinan: you seem to blow relationships way out of proportion
BrianJCullinan: i am your friend
BrianJCullinan: you are my friend
BrianJCullinan: weather we are best friends or not, only time will tell
UofM3586: well it does not feel like it ne more
BrianJCullinan: we needs to focus on now, and talking now, not talking later, or talking yestarday, you're here NOW
UofM3586: ok well I just wanted to say that I am really sorry for being a total jerk to you
