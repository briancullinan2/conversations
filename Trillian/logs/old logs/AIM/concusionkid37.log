[06/10/2004 10:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe you should because i'm not doing to well
[06/10/2004 10:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i called her to say good night, and 10 min later she hung up on me without even a goodbye
[06/10/2004 10:50 PM] Greg: that sucks
[06/10/2004 10:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just don't know
[06/10/2004 10:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: she makes fun of me a lot because i'm such a fucking nerd
[06/10/2004 10:51 PM] Greg: then dump the broad shes not worth it i kno!

[06/10/2004 10:51 PM] Greg: dude u wanna kno how she dumped me 
[06/10/2004 10:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: i asked her to homecoming, i'm kind of hoping things will get better before then
[06/10/2004 10:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: why?
[06/10/2004 10:52 PM] Greg: she sent her fucking freind to tell me she didnt even take the time to tell me 
[06/10/2004 10:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but you were both younger, less experienced then
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: its a weird thing being around her
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] Greg: well i was she wasnt lol
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: she makes me feel small and pathetic
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] Greg: ya shes good at that
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: even though i am taller, and stronger, i still feal weak around her
[06/10/2004 10:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: like shes the one wearing the pants
[06/10/2004 10:54 PM] Greg: cause shes good at crushing ur nuts
[06/10/2004 10:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: and she usually is, i wear shorts, and she wears baggy pants
[06/10/2004 10:54 PM] Greg: lol
[06/10/2004 10:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just don't know what to do, i don't even want a relationship to be short, long relationships are good, builds character
[06/10/2004 10:55 PM] Greg: but ya if u feel like shit everytime ur around her it does help ur character 
[06/10/2004 10:55 PM] Greg: doesnt**
[06/10/2004 10:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i don't want to dump her, i'm still attracted to her, it is just i don't think she is that interested in me
[06/10/2004 10:55 PM] Greg: uh huh 
[06/10/2004 10:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm, well the least i can do is make an effort to be around her and be a good boyfriend, at least until homecoming
[06/10/2004 10:57 PM] Greg: mell my diagnosis (as a future shrink) is to tel l her what u told me talk to her ( ull feel like a chick but o well) tell her u feel like she treats u worse than shit
[06/10/2004 10:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol its not THAT bad
[06/10/2004 10:57 PM] Greg: o ok
