[11/21/2005 10:23 PM] Jesus: what's it on?
[11/21/2005 10:23 PM] Me: Your assignment is to write a two or three page typed, double-spaced paper as if you were a journalist and writing a review of the Armory Show. You should pick at least two pieces from the exhibit: they may be paintings, watercolors, or sculptures. They should be from two different artists. If you choose to write about the more controversial pieces you will have more to write about, and you will want to explain why they were controversial. From the material in Chapter 5 of The Art of Being Human, and the materials provided at the website, you should be able to write about the nature of the exhibit and the publics response to it. There are more materials in the other articles that you can reach from the Welcome page. In the exhibit, I would suggest you start with Galleries I, O and Q, which are the galleries with French paintings.
[11/21/2005 10:24 PM] Jesus: what artists do u gave
[11/21/2005 10:24 PM] Me: none

[03/06/2006 11:33 PM] Jesus: i have a philosophical question
[03/06/2006 11:33 PM] Jesus: is the earth here for our use, or should we be serving the needs of the earth
[03/06/2006 11:34 PM] Me: its like everything else including our body its is a container
[03/06/2006 11:34 PM] Me: it holds us
[03/06/2006 11:34 PM] Me: god created the earth for us to live in peace and flourish
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Jesus: so it is for our use
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Me: he created man so that he could spend eternity with our pure love
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Jesus: should we worry about conservation
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Jesus: or will he step in to help us fix it
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Me: when adam bit the apple the earth changed
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Me: it became a necessity for us to live
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Jesus: of course
[03/06/2006 11:35 PM] Me: he had to harvest everything from the earth
[03/06/2006 11:36 PM] Jesus: yeah
[03/06/2006 11:36 PM] Me: now we have continued don't that path of needing earthly goods, when originally we could feed on love
[03/06/2006 11:36 PM] Me: we have to conserve the earth in order to continue to live
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Jesus: ok
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Me: but when we die we go to god and live in his kindom and never feel hunger for anything but his love ever again
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Jesus: so both
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Jesus: not either
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Me: so what we should be asking is what happens when its all gone?
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Me: life slows down and we live eternity on our respective sides
[03/06/2006 11:37 PM] Jesus: and what do u think about that?
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Me: when the earth cannot sustain life god will make his move
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Me: hence revelations, he will reveal himself
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Jesus: that shouldn't take more than 20 years
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Me: probably not
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Jesus: lol
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Me: i just hope i have my yacht by then
[03/06/2006 11:38 PM] Me: i love sailing and i love boats
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Jesus: nice work
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Me: sailing is like sex between you and the vast never ending waters
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Jesus: yacht, not speedboat
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Jesus: jeez
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Me: yeah a yacht likes to take its time
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Me: nice and smooth and long ride
[03/06/2006 11:39 PM] Me: a speed boat just speeds through it
[03/06/2006 11:40 PM] Jesus: alright
[03/06/2006 11:40 PM] Me: you know one of the bible's main intentions is to shut people up
[03/06/2006 11:40 PM] Jesus: maybe
[03/06/2006 11:40 PM] Me: people that argue with the word of god, the bible has an explanation for everything
[03/06/2006 11:41 PM] Me: it says that people are willfully ignorant of the bible, hence why jews are going to hell
[03/06/2006 11:41 PM] Jesus: it also can disprove itself
[03/06/2006 11:41 PM] Me: hows that?
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Jesus: this is just as i understand
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Jesus: i am really ignorant of the bible
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Me: gods word is perfect, the only flaws in the bible are made through translation
[03/06/2006 11:42 PM] Jesus: ok
[03/06/2006 11:56 PM] Me: alright well enough religious propaganda
[03/06/2006 11:56 PM] Me: i g2g to bed

[03/08/2006 11:33 AM] Me: so i think i have a habit of being too honest
[03/08/2006 11:34 AM] Me: Me:     i'm going to go out on a limb here, you're very attractive and fun to be around, if i wasn't already involved with someone i would totally want to date you, but like i said, i'm already involved with someone.  but i'm also not the only one that think that, i think you can imagine the other person i'm talking about  
 christina Sanders:     yeah i think can imagine  
 christina Sanders:     to be honest i am not surprised about both of you  
 me:     that obvious?
[03/08/2006 11:36 AM] Me: she keeps expressing how much she enjoys hanging out with us dood, you just have to reel her in
[03/08/2006 11:36 AM] Me: i mean she told us what time she was available before we even suggested anything'
[03/08/2006 11:36 AM] Me: its time to ask for a hug
[03/08/2006 11:41 AM] Jesus: lol
[03/08/2006 11:41 AM] Jesus: sry
[03/08/2006 11:41 AM] Jesus: french horn as usual
[03/08/2006 11:41 AM] Jesus: umm........
[03/08/2006 11:42 AM] Jesus: a socially acceptable time wouldn't be with three of us there
[03/08/2006 11:42 AM] Jesus: do u agree?
[03/08/2006 11:47 AM] Me: what do you mean?
[03/08/2006 11:48 AM] Jesus: if.... hypothetically... i did make a move, during a movie let's say, and it progressed to the point where we were making out
[03/08/2006 11:48 AM] Jesus: the third would be in an akward situation
[03/08/2006 11:48 AM] Jesus: is that correct?
[03/08/2006 11:48 AM] Me: dude don't worry about me, i could care less
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Jesus: alright
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Me: she might care though, but that is a ways off, start slow
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Me: start with a hug
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Jesus: well then
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Me: then a more personal meeting with just you two
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Jesus: yeah
[03/08/2006 11:49 AM] Jesus: maybe ur right
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: dude she has an incredible body, when we move into together feel free to mess around with her while i'm there
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: 3 way
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: j/k
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: uhhh just take it slow
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Jesus: yeah
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Jesus: i plan on that
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: you don't have to include me in everything
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Jesus: im not ready for a fast-paced relationship
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Jesus: i know
[03/08/2006 11:50 AM] Jesus: but it sounds like ur involved already
[03/08/2006 11:51 AM] Me: funny you said that, she never responded to me telling her i was attracted to her
[03/08/2006 11:51 AM] Jesus: yeah
[03/08/2006 11:51 AM] Me: so i think this could go either way
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: that's what i don't like
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Me: and i am not going to take it any further, i have a girlfriend
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: every time there has been any competition though
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: although i know u won't
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: i just don't know if she wants u
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: in which case i'd back down
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Me: so eventually meet with her alone hang out at java just you two that kind of thing, keep getting to know her, and watch a movie with just you too, its a simple process, you'll get there
[03/08/2006 11:52 AM] Jesus: so i have ever time there was competition
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Me: nah dude, be a little more aggressive
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Jesus: maybe ur right
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Me: just keep talking to her, develop that relationship
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Jesus: slow
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Me: yeah
[03/08/2006 11:53 AM] Me: but not too slow, you don't want to put to much time in there someone else will swoop in and take the priz
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Jesus: she isn't a prize
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Me: lol
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Jesus: that's a horrible analogy
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Me: i just mean winning over her heart
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Jesus: it isn't winning though
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Jesus: ive always hated that analogy
[03/08/2006 11:54 AM] Me: sry
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Me: but there are tons of over people that would love to be with an incredible girl like her
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: its more like finding something u didn't know u wanted until u had it
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: i know
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Me: so you really are competing against other people
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: i don't compete
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Me: anyways that's not the point
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: we've discussed that much
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: no it isn't
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Jesus: ur right
[03/08/2006 11:55 AM] Me: consider this, we hung out with her monday
[03/08/2006 11:56 AM] Jesus: and......
[03/08/2006 11:58 AM] Me: i invited her over granted, but she did enjoy being around us, yesterday i invited her to java because i want more comedy so i was after the cd, now of course i'm attracted to her, but i will settle with friends, furthermore i am obligated to because i'm committed to someone else, but she hung out with us all last night and loved it (so she says).  today i let her know that i was attracted to her but i have someone else, and she still wants to be around us, so obviously shes going to choose you
[03/08/2006 11:58 AM] Me: brb
[03/08/2006 12:03 PM] Jesus: u back yet
[03/08/2006 12:04 PM] Me: yeah

[03/09/2006 08:52 PM] Jesus: here it is
[03/09/2006 08:52 PM] Jesus: Yeah thats an awesome idea. To get the process rolling, Brian should call Jamie Patton, the Sechrist Residence Hall Director at 523-8787 and explain that he would like to move to your room. That should get the wheels in motion.

[03/09/2006 09:38 PM] Jesus: that was plenty
[03/09/2006 09:38 PM] Jesus: it made me feel a little better, if nothing else
[03/09/2006 09:38 PM] Me: i think you took things too seriously, i know we are all hopeful to find that meaningful relationship with a significant other, you can't let it get you down
[03/09/2006 09:39 PM] Me: i'm glad you got it off your chest though
[03/09/2006 09:39 PM] Jesus: that wasn't y i was upset though
[03/09/2006 09:40 PM] Me: why were you upset?
[03/09/2006 09:40 PM] Jesus: a couple reasons
[03/09/2006 09:40 PM] Jesus: one was i never made a move
[03/09/2006 09:40 PM] Jesus: the other was that this was the third time this semester that it had been me and a buddy of mine, and a girl i liked, and every time she has chosen him
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Jesus: not that im angry
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Jesus: just surprised this time
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Me: ready to go back into the world and find another beautiful girl to hang out with?
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Jesus: lol
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Jesus: im not sure i want to
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Me: eventually we will find one that doesn't prefer me over you
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Me: j/k
[03/09/2006 09:41 PM] Jesus: it was just weird, all the encouragement u gave me
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Jesus: i wasn't expecting it
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Me: dude i know you are wonderful, i love your company, and i know we can find a girl that enjoys you even more
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Jesus: stop
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Jesus: just give me time
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Jesus: i will be fine... eventually
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Me: you just have to put yourself out there, you know how many times Aaron did that to me
[03/09/2006 09:42 PM] Me: we've all been there, it will be fine
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: its just that i never really have gained anything from my other relationships
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: except a more thourough understanding of pain
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Me: i'm sorry i pushed you, i really though you had it in the bad, i never expected her to like me
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: i don't see the point is all
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Me: lol that's terrible dude
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: i did though
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: that's the thing
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Jesus: i called it
[03/09/2006 09:43 PM] Me: well, lets just put this behind us and move on
[03/09/2006 09:44 PM] Jesus: im fine w/ u
[03/09/2006 09:44 PM] Jesus: im pissed at myself
[03/09/2006 09:44 PM] Me: i just wish that because i already had someone, it would be easier for you to meet someone with me there to break the ice (i mean what do i have to lose right?)
[03/09/2006 09:45 PM] Jesus: that isn't something that a friend usually helps with
[03/09/2006 09:45 PM] Jesus: i discovered that this semester
[03/09/2006 09:45 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: the three different girls that i liked
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: it was always her, me, and a buddy
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: thought i eplained this already
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: explained*
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Me: not in enough detail
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: she chose my buddy
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Jesus: all three times
[03/09/2006 09:46 PM] Me: was he available?
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Jesus: not in ur case
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Jesus: lol
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Me: yeah see so it doesn't apply
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Jesus: lol
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Jesus: the fact that she chose u over me dude
[03/09/2006 09:47 PM] Me: so what, one girl, there are tons of beautiful girls around
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Me: ok tell you what, next time we go to java, i will go out on a limb just to introduce you to a pretty girl
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: no
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: just drop it
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: im tired of looking
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: it has been a year
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: and nothing has changed
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: i don't care about it anymore
[03/09/2006 09:48 PM] Jesus: this was the last time
[03/09/2006 09:49 PM] Me: are you turning gay?
[03/09/2006 09:49 PM] Jesus: just stop
[03/09/2006 09:49 PM] Jesus: please
[03/09/2006 09:51 PM] Me: ok
[03/09/2006 09:51 PM] Me: i was just trying to be supportive
[03/09/2006 09:51 PM] Jesus: thanks
[03/09/2006 09:52 PM] Jesus: i appreciate it
[03/09/2006 09:52 PM] Jesus: but it's nothing that u can help with
[03/09/2006 09:53 PM] Me: jesus i want to believe that there isn't a problem here, i think you are taking this a little to hard, its not like being single is some kind of disability, but your treating it like one and giving up on trying to cure it
[03/09/2006 09:53 PM] Jesus: no
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Jesus: i have had about ten prospects in the last year
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Jesus: none worked out
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Jesus: 6/7 gfs cheated on me
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Jesus: im just fucking tired
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Jesus: that's all
[03/09/2006 09:54 PM] Me: jeese dude, you're right, i'm sorry i pushed you
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Jesus: its not ur fault
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Jesus: ur trying to help
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Jesus: its my fault
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Me: no
[03/09/2006 09:55 PM] Me: its not your fault either
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Jesus: explain then
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Jesus: cuz im fucking lost
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Me: that's what i am talking about, there is nothing you could have done, it is the girl that keeps messing up
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Jesus: 16/17?
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Jesus: r u fucking kidding
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Me: you had a lot of bad experiences and you convinced yourself that its something wrong with you
[03/09/2006 09:56 PM] Me: i can't tell you what happened in the past
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Me: all i can say is, i saw 1 mistake
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Me: and it was mine
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Jesus: no
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Jesus: i should know better
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Me: ok it was yours
[03/09/2006 09:57 PM] Me: you're not confident enough because girls in the past cut off your balls
[03/09/2006 09:58 PM] Jesus: no they didn't, they obsessions for other guys balls
[03/09/2006 10:00 PM] Me: so maybe you were looking in the wrong places, christina was a good change in that, you initialized the entire conversation i admire you for that, and she was totally in your league, because in college there are no separate leagues, you could have a chance with anyone
[03/09/2006 10:00 PM] Me: i'm going to let this go for now, but i hope you think about that and realize how true it is
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Jesus: i don't believe it
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Jesus: ive never had a girl like that
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Me: let it sink in
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Jesus: y should i expect to
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Me: *tear*, the thing is i know exactly how you're feeling right now
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Jesus: u think i haven't gone over these arguments in my head a dozen times?
[03/09/2006 10:01 PM] Me: and the lying side one

[03/12/2006 02:15 PM] Jesus: like when i left suddenly
[03/12/2006 02:15 PM] Jesus: i was frustrated at what u said
[03/12/2006 02:15 PM] Jesus: although i knew it to be a joke
[03/12/2006 02:16 PM] Jesus: i went out and over the course of a couple hours i realized that i was frustrated b/c u were absolutely right
[03/12/2006 02:16 PM] Me: wait, i can't even remember probably because i didn't know it hurt you, what did i say?
[03/12/2006 02:17 PM] Jesus: it was a joke in refrence to the fact that i haven't had a gf in a while and that u have one of the few i would've chosen
[03/12/2006 02:17 PM] Jesus: i don't remember the wording
[03/12/2006 02:17 PM] Me: oh that
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Me: i could probably find it in my records
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Jesus: \lol
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Jesus: don't bother
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Me: well, i am the one who should be appologizing
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Jesus: no
[03/12/2006 02:18 PM] Jesus: you were absolutely right
[03/12/2006 02:19 PM] Me: i have tried to be really positive and supportive of you with this situation, but i guess i failed to really understand things from your point of view
[03/12/2006 02:19 PM] Jesus: how do u understand them?
[03/12/2006 02:20 PM] Me: well i know that you were hurt in previous relationships, and i tried to encourage you to get out there and give it your all no matter what, but i guess you just have a fear of being hurt again
[03/12/2006 02:21 PM] Jesus: not only that
[03/12/2006 02:21 PM] Jesus: but yes
[03/12/2006 02:23 PM] Me: well i hope that someday you explain it to me so i can fully understand you and help you become a more outgoing person
[03/12/2006 02:24 PM] Jesus: how about today?
[03/12/2006 02:25 PM] Me: ok
[03/12/2006 02:25 PM] Me: if you want to tell me now that would be fine
[03/12/2006 02:26 PM] Jesus: in this particular situation, i felt really confused at the fact that you were pusing me to be more outgoing with her although i believed that she had little or no interest
[03/12/2006 02:26 PM] Jesus: even after the night at Keifer's
[03/12/2006 02:27 PM] Jesus: aside from this one, i have felt even with the girls i progressed with, that i simply wasn't ready
[03/12/2006 02:28 PM] Jesus: after all the time i have spent dwelling over past gf's, as well as searching for new ones, despite the fact that truly it has brought next to nothing but pain
[03/12/2006 02:28 PM] Jesus: i feel as though i have no reason to keep looking, or hoping for things to change
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Me: ok then lets not look together, we will just make friends with people
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Jesus: ive been doing that
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Me: practice make perfect right?
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Jesus: no
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Jesus: it doesn't
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Jesus: perfection is unattainable
[03/12/2006 02:29 PM] Me: well no one is perfect
[03/12/2006 02:30 PM] Jesus: therefore practice makes better
[03/12/2006 02:30 PM] Me: so it makes near perfect
[03/12/2006 02:30 PM] Me: or better works too
[03/12/2006 02:30 PM] Jesus: yep
[03/12/2006 02:30 PM] Jesus: that's the one
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Me: so eventually you will meet a girl and it will just click
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Jesus: i don't believe so
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Jesus: id rather not risk i at this point
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Me: w/e dude thre is someone out there everywhere
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Jesus: so id rather just have a friend
[03/12/2006 02:31 PM] Me: well when it happens we will both know
[03/12/2006 02:32 PM] Me: but it will
[03/12/2006 02:32 PM] Jesus: im not going to agree with you on that
[03/12/2006 02:33 PM] Me: ok
