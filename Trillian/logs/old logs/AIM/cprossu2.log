[14/10/2004 09:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: so anyway (im bad with names) you are the one who asked about port forwarding on a dlink router right? if not then i know who you are lol
[14/10/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: is that your IP?
[14/10/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: how did u do that?
[14/10/2004 09:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: Apache
[14/10/2004 09:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: and port forwarding
[14/10/2004 09:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: it is actually simpler than you might think
[14/10/2004 09:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: yet i went through 2 years of cisco training to learn all this shit
[14/10/2004 09:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[14/10/2004 09:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: (believe it or not, a scrap comp and linux makes a better router than a $5,000 cisco)

[19/10/2004 01:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: i need your help
[19/10/2004 01:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: sup
[19/10/2004 01:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok 2 things
[19/10/2004 01:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: first, how do you burn a vcd file extracted from a cd, back onto cd?
[19/10/2004 01:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: easy
[19/10/2004 01:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: do you have nero?
[19/10/2004 01:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: second, i still can't get remote desktop to work outside of my network, not even on the main computer
[19/10/2004 01:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[19/10/2004 01:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: download nero
[19/10/2004 01:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: and on the second one you need to forward ports and config ip's
[19/10/2004 01:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: this isn't a regular vcd, it is a game cd that is copied and compiled into vcd format or something
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i configured the ports already
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i use d-link
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: i found instructions on their site and followed then exactly
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: did you send the ports
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: that is the problem
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: you never follow the man
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: then i want to microsoft and folowed their instructions
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: send what ports?
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: how?
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: ok check this out
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: you need to open the ports to YOUR COMP ONLY
[19/10/2004 01:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: not to all of em
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: i did that
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: it would work then
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: what is the ip
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: of your comp
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: locally
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: 192.x.x.x
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: right
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: i typed in the IP for my computer just like it told me to
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: correct
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: what exactly is it
[19/10/2004 01:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then i used the port that remote desktop requires
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: type cmd in run
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: and then ipconfig
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: 192.168.0.103
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: ok
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: did that
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: and that is the ip you used
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: correct
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: (Link: http://support.dlink.com/faq/view.asp?prod_id=1324)http://support.dlink.com/faq/view.asp?prod_id=1324
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: continuing on
[19/10/2004 01:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: i followed that exactly
[19/10/2004 01:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it says it is for windows xp remote desktop
[19/10/2004 01:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: everything checks out right
[19/10/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: but then in remote desktop i type in the IP downstairs it is like 24.251.168.148 or something like that
[19/10/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: and then i add the :3389
[19/10/2004 01:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: and type in my user name and password and it says it can't connect
[19/10/2004 01:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: did you just the local ip
[19/10/2004 01:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: dlink wont loop route itself
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: no the actual WAN IP
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: does the local ip
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: that is loop routing
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you type the LAN ip
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: it works
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: right
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you think if i call my friend and tell him to type it in it will work?
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: should
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: with which ip?
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: www.whatismyip.com)www.whatismyip.com
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: go there
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: WAN?
[19/10/2004 01:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: make sure
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: it is the one on that website
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: do i use the default gateway or the real IP
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: see that website?
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: www.whatismyip.com)www.whatismyip.com
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: use the ip that the page comes up with
[19/10/2004 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: what routers can loop?
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: linux routers
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: cisco routers
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: or if you both open, forward, and set up a virtual server
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: the dlink (but badly)
[19/10/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: my smoothwall has no problems with that
[19/10/2004 01:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: i can type in the wan ip
[19/10/2004 01:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: and get my web server on the dmz
[19/10/2004 01:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: i also have a VPN set up with a guy 2,000 miles away so i can access his network and he can access mine
[19/10/2004 01:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: and since my firewall takes care of it it can stay up 24/7
[19/10/2004 01:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: (basically all that you do is scrounge up some parts and install this on it : (Link: http://www.smoothwall.org/)http://www.smoothwall.org/)
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: is there some security settings my friend testing it for me needs to change?
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: mine runs off a PIII 450 with 3 network cards and a 850mb hdd
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: he shouldnt need to change anything if his router is client action based
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: otherwise he may have to open up a outgoing port
[19/10/2004 02:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: how would he check that?
[19/10/2004 02:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: what brand of router does he have?
[19/10/2004 02:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: he has my intel anypoint
[19/10/2004 02:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: never fooled with those
[19/10/2004 02:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[19/10/2004 02:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: it's the only thing we could afford to give away
[19/10/2004 02:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: figures
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: we put in his cable internet
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] Nerd Andrew: siemens made a good single port router which you could pick up for under $20
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] Nerd Andrew: loll
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah maybe some other time
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] Nerd Andrew: and that's the one i liked giving out
[19/10/2004 02:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll just have to wait for my dad to figure it out
[19/10/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: anyway did you set up virtual server?
[19/10/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: (it isnt working for him is it?)

[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: as in one which comes up as a seperat drive?
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: oh thats easy
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes yes yes
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: copy cd
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: and just use the vcd as the source
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmmm
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: can roxio do it?
[19/10/2004 02:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: probably
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: how to i inject it without using the software?
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: um
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: because it wants me to buy it
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i don't want to
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: =\
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i want to make a copy
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: what game?
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: it wants me to buy the software used to copy it
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: o
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: is the vcd up?
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: and does it copy cd key encryption to?
[19/10/2004 03:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: up?
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: not sure
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: hm
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: is it up as a drive letter
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: the vcd
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: then copy it from the drive letter
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: to a cd
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i have to use the software
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: with roxio
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: and see if it works
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: to inject it
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: inject it?
[19/10/2004 03:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: insert
[19/10/2004 03:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: and usually when you copy a cd it doesn't copy the cd key encryption or leaves something out if it is a "play" cd
[19/10/2004 03:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: you could just use daemon tools
[19/10/2004 03:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: for vcd
[19/10/2004 03:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/portal/portal.php)http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/portal/portal.php

[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol think so?
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: i know so
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: there isn't that much
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: why is blue such a problem?
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: get a less crappy monitor is how i respond
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: there's just enough to make it look unprofessional
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: you think so?
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: even with the best of monitors
[06/12/2004 11:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: what should i change?
[06/12/2004 11:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: well....hunter green would be ok.....but im still wondering how the 0 and 1 thing fits into the page
[06/12/2004 11:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: i made it myself and i think it looks cool
[06/12/2004 11:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: still what is wrong with blue?
[06/12/2004 11:30 PM] Nerd Andrew: here are a couple examples of pages some of my friends made
[06/12/2004 11:30 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://ecsclan.com/)http://ecsclan.com/
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://netboundaries.com/)http://netboundaries.com/
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: one entailing the proper use of blue
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: uh it looks like they used a template from php-nuke
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: <-- not impressed
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: beats yours
[06/12/2004 11:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: (sorry)
[06/12/2004 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: the second one is pretty
[06/12/2004 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: so basically its the blue on black that creates problems
[06/12/2004 11:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: the only good example of good 'ol hand coded html that I could show you is  long down =(
[06/12/2004 11:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[06/12/2004 11:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: and dark blue specifically
[06/12/2004 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i use darkblue
[06/12/2004 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: tell me what to change
[06/12/2004 11:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: please
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: sorry-I flunked making decent web pages as a kid
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: I made basic form=function type pages
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: is dark blue better then bright blue?
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: what if i tone down the binary and make the heading darker
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: would that look betteR?
[06/12/2004 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: i really like the blue accents
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: and without them it would be as diverse
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: make the binary the same width as your bars
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: how come?
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: it looks bad the way it is
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[06/12/2004 11:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: (honest)
[06/12/2004 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: should it just be the blue or keep the other colors in the bar?
[06/12/2004 11:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: you want your page to look as symetrical as possible
[06/12/2004 11:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: so you could fold it in half
[06/12/2004 11:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it would be essentially the same on both sides
[06/12/2004 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: so move some links around?
[06/12/2004 11:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[06/12/2004 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok

[08/12/2004 12:07 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'm trying to use my onboard nvidia ethernet adapter and i already entered my mac into the router bios and i go to connections in windows and everything check out ok even though it refuses to get the dhcp automatically it works if i configure it manualy, and it says it is connected and everything, but it never transfers any data

[08/12/2004 12:09 AM] Nerd Andrew: oh
[08/12/2004 12:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: because the goddamn ethernet refuses to transfor data
[08/12/2004 12:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: but it would be like 3 times as fast if i could get the damn thing working
[08/12/2004 12:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: i am also using a cat 6 cable
[08/12/2004 12:09 AM] BrianJCullinan: could that be the problem?

[08/12/2004 12:10 AM] BrianJCullinan: like 2 k
[08/12/2004 12:10 AM] Nerd Andrew: does the motherboard rj45 thingy have 2 lights?
[08/12/2004 12:10 AM] Nerd Andrew: (first of all)

[08/12/2004 12:26 AM] BrianJCullinan: ecs n2u400-a
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: k
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: are you using nvidia nforce drivers?
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: or ecs's from the cd?
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: probably microsoft
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: from windows update?
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: what do i download to get the nvidia dirvers?
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] BrianJCullinan: they are all up to date
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: damn that problem was easier to find than i thought
[08/12/2004 12:27 AM] Nerd Andrew: no they arnt
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] Nerd Andrew: ms drivers are inherently outdated
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] Nerd Andrew: and wrong for the hardware
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: where should i get the new ones?
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://www.nvidia.com/object/nforce_udp_win2k_4.27)http://www.nvidia.com/object/nforce_udp_win2k_4.27
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: doesn't nvidia have different ethernet board types?
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] Nerd Andrew: no
[08/12/2004 12:28 AM] BrianJCullinan: how do i know which one to get?
[08/12/2004 12:29 AM] Nerd Andrew: i thought it was easy
[08/12/2004 12:29 AM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 12:29 AM] Nerd Andrew: us english
[08/12/2004 12:29 AM] Nerd Andrew: your choice of mirror sites
[08/12/2004 12:29 AM] BrianJCullinan: that will fix problem?
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] Nerd Andrew: should
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: windows out of date?
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: unheard up
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: *of
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] Nerd Andrew: not to mention
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: almost only on everything
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] Nerd Andrew: wrong driver set
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: because the bastards can't just test the drivers written by companies
[08/12/2004 12:30 AM] BrianJCullinan: no microsoft has to rewrite them themselves
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: what?!
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: is there a different download link?
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: the windows set
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: has an issue
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: then what should i install?
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: (it doesn't work on most mobos too well)
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: the nvidia one i sent you
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: downlaod and install it
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok i downloaded that on
[08/12/2004 12:31 AM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[08/12/2004 12:32 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[08/12/2004 12:32 AM] Nerd Andrew: it should install everything and detect everything so the correct drivers are installed
[08/12/2004 12:33 AM] BrianJCullinan: can't do that without a registry (linux sux)
[08/12/2004 12:33 AM] Nerd Andrew: there may be some router configs you are missing, but since you mentioned chipset inherant problems and using the windows drivers, I want to cover that base first
[08/12/2004 12:33 AM] Nerd Andrew: cant do what?
[08/12/2004 12:33 AM] BrianJCullinan: autodetect what is already installed
[08/12/2004 12:33 AM] Nerd Andrew: yeah you can
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: do i want every part of this driver?
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: it treats every piece of hardware as a module
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: hint /dev
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: dev means device btw
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: do i want to install all of this driver?
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: all of it
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] BrianJCullinan: IDE SW?
[08/12/2004 12:34 AM] Nerd Andrew: take that one off
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] Nerd Andrew: since you installed without it
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] BrianJCullinan: what is it?
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] Nerd Andrew: it will just create a mess
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] Nerd Andrew: (IDE controller from nv)
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok g2g restart
[08/12/2004 12:35 AM] Nerd Andrew: mzkdx it go faster

[08/12/2004 12:42 AM] Nerd Andrew: so you just enabled it?
[08/12/2004 12:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: i disabled this one and enable the other one
[08/12/2004 12:42 AM] Nerd Andrew: ic
[08/12/2004 12:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: and nothing worked
[08/12/2004 12:42 AM] BrianJCullinan: so i switch them back

[08/12/2004 12:45 AM] Nerd Andrew: Q) did you set it as a static ip on the router?
[08/12/2004 12:45 AM] Nerd Andrew: or dynamic
[08/12/2004 12:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: no i want it to use dynamic
[08/12/2004 12:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: that's where the other ones are set up
[08/12/2004 12:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i have reserved 192.168.0.106 for my ethernet
[08/12/2004 12:46 AM] BrianJCullinan: and put that mac there
[08/12/2004 12:46 AM] Nerd Andrew: type ipconfig /all
[08/12/2004 12:46 AM] Nerd Andrew: and make sure the MAC you put in
[08/12/2004 12:46 AM] Nerd Andrew: was correct
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: but for some reason it doesn't want to get that ip, it is "autoconguration IP" => 169.154.84.143 <somerandom number
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] Nerd Andrew: hang on
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] Nerd Andrew: go back to cmd
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] Nerd Andrew: type ipconfig /all
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: i did
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: the mac is correct
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] Nerd Andrew: make sure the mac you put into the router was correct
[08/12/2004 12:47 AM] Nerd Andrew: double check
[08/12/2004 12:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: yup
[08/12/2004 12:48 AM] Nerd Andrew: hmmm
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] Nerd Andrew: and you have a cord going from the back of the computer to the router in question right?
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: yes
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: the connection for the cords shows it is plugged in slot 3
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] Nerd Andrew: k
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: that's where i plugged it in
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] Nerd Andrew: reboot the router
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: everything says it is connected but data doesn't go through
[08/12/2004 12:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: i've done it since then but i'll do it again
[08/12/2004 12:51 AM] Nerd Andrew: when done do another /renew
[08/12/2004 12:51 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[08/12/2004 12:51 AM] BrianJCullinan: brb
[08/12/2004 12:51 AM] BrianJCullinan: let me just enable my server first
[08/12/2004 12:52 AM] Nerd Andrew:  and by reboot i mean a full power cycle
[08/12/2004 12:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: not just a clicky reset
[08/12/2004 12:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: i know
[08/12/2004 12:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: kk
[08/12/2004 12:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: making sure
[08/12/2004 12:53 AM] BrianJCullinan: ok brb
[08/12/2004 12:53 AM] Nerd Andrew: (the other things to check in this order would be 1) swapping the port on the router and 2) swapping the cord to the comp from the router )]

[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: depends on what it is
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: graphics card, mobo, scsi card?
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] WG Wise Master: i ruined my dvd RW drive last night after you signed off
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: uh oh
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] WG Wise Master: i don't really want to have to buy a new one
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: what brand and model?
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] WG Wise Master: isn't there like a reset for those things? a backup firmware?
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: take it out and look
[08/12/2004 01:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[08/12/2004 01:18 PM] WG Wise Master: emprex
[08/12/2004 01:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: get the exact model

[08/12/2004 01:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: from the drive itself
[08/12/2004 01:21 PM] WG Wise Master: how?
[08/12/2004 01:21 PM] WG Wise Master: oh
[08/12/2004 01:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: take it out

[08/12/2004 01:21 PM] WG Wise Master: ok
[08/12/2004 01:23 PM] WG Wise Master: i got my connection working, but if you have two enabled at the same time will both be used to be extra fast or will only the faster connection be used?
[08/12/2004 01:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: just use the wired
[08/12/2004 01:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: it wont matter as the speed is limited by your net connection
[08/12/2004 01:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: and load balancing wont yield a speedup when your secondary is wireless
[08/12/2004 01:24 PM] WG Wise Master: well the max on the wireless is only 54mbits
[08/12/2004 01:24 PM] WG Wise Master: but the ethernet is 100
[08/12/2004 01:25 PM] WG Wise Master: so don't i want to use the faster?

[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] WG Wise Master: ok

[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] WG Wise Master: yeah
[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: there is less latency
[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: anyway goto that page

[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah 
[08/12/2004 01:26 PM] WG Wise Master: because the install screwed it up

[08/12/2004 01:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: i was so pissed that i refused to buy another btc product period
[08/12/2004 01:27 PM] WG Wise Master: the ID String DVDRW ide 1004?
[08/12/2004 01:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[08/12/2004 01:28 PM] WG Wise Master: should i get the latest firmware?
[08/12/2004 01:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: firmware is the 1004IM
[08/12/2004 01:28 PM] WG Wise Master: the 0151?
[08/12/2004 01:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: try that one first
[08/12/2004 01:28 PM] WG Wise Master: ok
[08/12/2004 01:30 PM] WG Wise Master: but how can i plug this drive in if the bios can't detect it?
[08/12/2004 01:31 PM] WG Wise Master: and it started messing with my virtual drives, should i uninstall that stuff?
[08/12/2004 01:32 PM] WG Wise Master: should i plug it in while windows is started?
[08/12/2004 01:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[08/12/2004 01:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: just plug it in before powering up the comp
[08/12/2004 01:32 PM] WG Wise Master: ok then what do i do if it can't get past the IDE detect in the bios?
[08/12/2004 01:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: if i recall the bios flash util should be able to detect the drive
[08/12/2004 01:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: if its on the IDE bus
[08/12/2004 01:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: but under no circumstances connect it when windows is running
[08/12/2004 01:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: you could fry your ide controller
[08/12/2004 01:33 PM] WG Wise Master: lol i know i wasn't really going to
[08/12/2004 01:35 PM] WG Wise Master: how do i get to the bios flash?
[08/12/2004 01:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: remember
[08/12/2004 01:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: it has nothing to do with the mobo
[08/12/2004 01:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: just run that util in windows and follow the dirrections
[08/12/2004 01:36 PM] WG Wise Master: yeah but i can't start windows if the ide detect doesn't go through
[08/12/2004 01:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: HUH?
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: hit F1 to continue?
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] WG Wise Master: i can't get past the "Detecting drives"
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: errr
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] WG Wise Master: i could try it
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: hit <esc>
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: when it is trying to detect
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: the drive
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] WG Wise Master: is there a setting in the bios i can change before it trys to detect?
[08/12/2004 01:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah 
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: set the drive in question to none
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: instead of auto
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] WG Wise Master: because i think i can get to the bios after the memory reading and before the detecting drives
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] WG Wise Master: in advanced features?
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: standard
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] WG Wise Master: ok
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] WG Wise Master: i'll try
[08/12/2004 01:38 PM] WG Wise Master: bb in like 5
Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Nerd Andrew): Wed Dec 08 14:03:57 2004
[08/12/2004 02:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: no luck
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: damn
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: said drive failure after waiting all of too long
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: couldn't even start windows
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's odd
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: did you try <esc>
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: =\
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: wait a sec
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: and there was no drive in question option
[08/12/2004 02:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: are you set to boot up to cd first?
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: i can set it
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: but no
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: goto bios and set it to hdd first (in advanced)
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh wait
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: no hd01 is first
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: but cd-rom is second
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: put it to disabled
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: should i put none for it?, maybe set all of them to none
[08/12/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok, i have to go to a trumpet lesson soon
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] Nerd Andrew: all but hdd
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll try that l8er
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: thanks for your help
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: if i still don't have any luck maybe i will bring it to you and pay to like $20 to fix it
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: sound fair?
[08/12/2004 02:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean if it is fixable
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: otherwise i'll have to buy a new one
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah...I don't think that would be a good trade off though since you could just pick up a new 16x burner for like $80
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i don't want to spend money
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: not until i get a job
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] Nerd Andrew: *66.99 even
[08/12/2004 02:07 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-152-034&depa=0)http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-152-034&depa=0
[08/12/2004 02:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: you wouldn't happen to know SQL would you?
[08/12/2004 02:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Nerd Andrew): Wed Dec 08 15:42:12 2004
[08/12/2004 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: so you think you could try to fix it
[08/12/2004 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't mean spend a week trying
[08/12/2004 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: just try what you have done before and if it doesn't work oh well
[08/12/2004 03:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i could give it to you at class
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: I personally think it wouldn't be worth it
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but its a perfectly good drive except i ruined
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i feel bad
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i didn't buy it
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: my dad bought it for my mom and i took it
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: ic
[08/12/2004 03:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i ruined it
[08/12/2004 03:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'd be willing to pay you a fee
[08/12/2004 03:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: if you think you can fix it
[08/12/2004 03:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah but that fee isnt even worth the drive =/
[08/12/2004 03:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: how do you mean?
[08/12/2004 03:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: and i don't think i could fix it without doing some major desoldering and resoldering work on the actual flash rom, which i would then have to build an interface to in order to flash with the right image
[08/12/2004 03:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[08/12/2004 03:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[08/12/2004 03:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i guess i will just buy a new one then
[08/12/2004 03:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: damn
[08/12/2004 03:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: they need to put backup roms on these damn things
[08/12/2004 03:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: no they really dont
[08/12/2004 03:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: not too many people flash their drives
[08/12/2004 03:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah for idiots like me
[08/12/2004 03:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: (ei 1% or 1% of 1%)
[08/12/2004 03:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: *of
[08/12/2004 03:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: the cheapest you can buy is $52 on newegg
[08/12/2004 03:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: although id go for the NEC one
[08/12/2004 03:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: because it is the best one out
[08/12/2004 03:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: so people that make mistakes like i did, is this like a common learning experience or is this "you're a dumbass and need to find a knew major"
[08/12/2004 03:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: nope what? not a common mistake or i should find a new major because i'm a dumbass?
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: this is akin to plugging in the floppy connector in such a way that the 5v and ground rail are shorted
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: no biggie
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: it is not common, but it does happen once in a while to the best of 'em
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm well that's good to hear
[08/12/2004 03:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: then there was that one time i deleted my partition
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: one of my liteon cd burners had a bad encounter with a hard drive neodynium magnet
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it's flash was corrupted
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: but all i did was reflash it and it was fine
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: could i find that NEC at frys for cheep like on the site, or do i have to order from the site and pay shipping?
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: (the detection scheme had nothing to do with the bios)
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: you cannot get the nec at fry's
[08/12/2004 03:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: its an OEM type thing
[08/12/2004 03:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: isnt shipping like $1?
[08/12/2004 03:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: $5
[08/12/2004 03:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: anyway the next best thing is the pioneer A08 which you can get at fry's
[08/12/2004 03:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: but will cost you $139
[08/12/2004 03:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: since they overprice everything
[08/12/2004 03:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[08/12/2004 03:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: (The NEC is generally considered the best damn dvd burner period as far as speed and error control)
[08/12/2004 03:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm
[08/12/2004 03:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i guess i could order
[08/12/2004 03:53 PM] Nerd Andrew: kk
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: how long ago was it bought?
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: (just wondering)
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: like 2 weeks
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] BrianJCullinan: y?
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: ohhhh
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's very different
[08/12/2004 03:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: repack it, bring it in, tell em it stopped working after 2 weeks
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: we don't have the packaging
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: errr
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: you don't?
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: nope
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: why would you throw it away ?
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: (I still have all my boxes from even my first 486 system)
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: because we didn't plan on needing it
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: wow
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: they are damned handy
[08/12/2004 03:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: y?
[08/12/2004 03:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: whenever something fails you get a free replacement
[08/12/2004 03:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol yeah
[08/12/2004 03:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll keep that in mind
[08/12/2004 03:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: most things carry a 3yr manufacturer's warrenty
[08/12/2004 03:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: damn i wish we could take more classes together i learn so much from you
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah but don't you have to fill something out to get the warranty?
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: believe me, you would probably just learn how to put things off, be lazy, and play too many games
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: no you dont
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'll keep that in mind
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: or if you do
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: you can fill it out
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: and send it with the busted piece
[08/12/2004 03:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: granted that btc i told you about
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh yeah i took your advice
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: they wouldn't refund my busted win95 cd
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: k
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: amatures imitate pros steel
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: i wish i came up with that line
[08/12/2004 03:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: i stole the javascript off that guys site
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe it came with the theme but it was cool how when you move your cursor over it, it highlights
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: just restructure it a little so you can call it your own
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: know what i mean
[08/12/2004 03:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol i know i changed the colors and borders
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: i meant the code itself
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: its not complext code
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: ei if there are variables, rename em, etc
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: a little one liner
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: ok
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: nope no variables
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i could have done it myself
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just thought it was cool looking
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: but that's how lots o' people learn howto do webdesign
[08/12/2004 04:00 PM] BrianJCullinan:  onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='#111111';" onmouseout="this.style.backgroundColor='#000000';"

[17/12/2004 01:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: no fancy graphics
[17/12/2004 01:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: but it will be a while before a real standard is made for ver 3

[03/11/2005 11:47 AM] BrianJCullinan: incase anyone ever asks
[03/11/2005 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: it is incredibly fast
[03/11/2005 11:48 AM] BrianJCullinan: i don't know how the engine does it that fast, but it takes like 20 seconds to decode password on multiple levels
[03/11/2005 11:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: such as word recognition, brute force, mask, dictionary
[03/11/2005 11:49 AM] BrianJCullinan: all those options
[03/11/2005 11:49 AM] * Nerd Andrew just uses brute force on things on peoples hdd's slow, but always works
[03/11/2005 11:50 AM] * BrianJCullinan thinks that brute force can be slow and time consuming but not with this piece of software
[03/11/2005 11:50 AM] Nerd Andrew: just as long as i use my good tester machine, it only takes an hour or so...luckily ive gotten most of my clients to start remembering their pw's
[03/11/2005 11:51 AM] * BrianJCullinan thinks memory is specially allocated to handle this kind of load, and allows it to use a brute force attack and complete in under 20 seconds
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: it decodes M$ passwords that fast at least
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: rofl
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: what?
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: ms pw's are almost always in the reg
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah that's true
[03/11/2005 11:52 AM] Nerd Andrew: no proggy needed
[03/11/2005 11:53 AM] BrianJCullinan: where in the registry are they?
[03/11/2005 11:53 AM] Nerd Andrew: just do a search for the proggy in question
[03/11/2005 11:53 AM] Nerd Andrew: 8 times outa 10
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: what about the windows password
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: for user accounts
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] Nerd Andrew: just use syslinux
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] Nerd Andrew: and change the pass hash
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] BrianJCullinan: syslinux for windows?
[03/11/2005 11:54 AM] Nerd Andrew: syslinux
[03/11/2005 11:55 AM] Nerd Andrew: then gain access to the ntfs file system
[03/11/2005 11:55 AM] BrianJCullinan: syslinux for windows?
[03/11/2005 11:55 AM] Nerd Andrew: for windows
[03/11/2005 11:55 AM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[03/11/2005 11:55 AM] BrianJCullinan: which versions of linux can read NTFS?
[03/11/2005 11:56 AM] Nerd Andrew: every version can read it.
[03/11/2005 11:56 AM] BrianJCullinan: i don't believe that
[03/11/2005 11:56 AM] Nerd Andrew: to write it you just need certain modules
[03/11/2005 11:56 AM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[03/11/2005 11:56 AM] BrianJCullinan: which versions can write to it?
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: every version
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: you just need poroper modules
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: *proper
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: where do you get them?
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: just do some googles on it
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: like "windows XP password recovery tool"
[03/11/2005 11:57 AM] Nerd Andrew: ill bet someone has made a nice booting cd image by now

[04/18/2005 02:00 PM] Me: on a motherboard that i would like to buy sometime in the near futre
[04/18/2005 02:01 PM] Me: if i wanted a motherboard with:
 PCI expressx16
 Dual gigabit LAN
 
[04/18/2005 02:01 PM] Me: AMD chip
[04/18/2005 02:01 PM] Me: darn, i am not finished
[04/18/2005 02:02 PM] Me: 8-channel audio
 SATA (with RAID?)
 
[04/18/2005 02:02 PM] Me: i am considering the following to boards so far, it would be great if you could make some suggestions

[04/18/2005 02:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: frankly i would not buy either of those on purpose
[04/18/2005 02:08 PM] Me: what would you suggest?
[04/18/2005 02:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you are gonna go pci-x get one with 2 slots
[04/18/2005 02:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's the only advantage of pci-e
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Me: the DFI has two
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: *pci-x=pci-e
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: but dfi's....well...im sorry to say but are crummy in the quality control debt
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Me: but isn't it faster even if you are only using one pci-x card?
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Me: hmm
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: well not faster than agp if you use one pci-e
[04/18/2005 02:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: there is no advantage of pci-x
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Me: really?
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: unless you run 2 cards
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes really
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: its a gimmick
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Me: then what higher end mother board would you suggest?
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: like agp4x and 8x
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: i would recommend buying Asus
[04/18/2005 02:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: their products have never disapointed me
[04/18/2005 02:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: abit is a good 2nd choice though
[04/18/2005 02:11 PM] Me: ok one more thing
[04/18/2005 02:11 PM] Me: i am trying to find a big hard drive
[04/18/2005 02:11 PM] Me: i have a 200GB and its down to 5GB
[04/18/2005 02:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: seagate makes a nice cheapo 300gber
[04/18/2005 02:12 PM] Nerd Andrew: im not sure if they have the 400gber out yet...but they should
[04/18/2005 02:12 PM] Me: mainly because i have copied some DVDs and all the games that require the CD to run, so i don't have to go take it out of my alphabetized collection every time i want to play
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Me: i don't think that 200% of 200GB is gonna be enough for me
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Me: but all the 500GB are just being talked about or over $500
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Me: that's not nice
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-14)http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-148-068&depa=0
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's a 400giger for 309
[04/18/2005 02:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: and a good one at that
[04/18/2005 02:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: but you can get 300gb ones for 1/2 price
[04/18/2005 02:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: why not get 2 300gb ones?
[04/18/2005 02:14 PM] Me: yeah
[04/18/2005 02:14 PM] Me: i might just do that
[04/18/2005 02:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: compusa sells em for 179 and i think fry;s is about the same
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: wait a little and you can get one for $120 with rebates
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Me: i think my step dad just got one around this (Link: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-359&depa=0)http://www.ne(Link: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-359&depa=0)wegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-14(Link: http://www.newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=22-144-359&depa=0)4-359&depa=0
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Me: something like that
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Me: with rebates
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Me: i think it came out to about 150 without tax
[04/18/2005 02:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: ill bet itll die within a year
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: all the newer maxtors tend to do that
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: really?
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: so i should go with seagate?
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's what i said ;)
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: my 200GB is a maxtor
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: its been over a year
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: no maybe not
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's good
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Me: now i'm scared
[04/18/2005 02:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: listen for clunking
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: clunking?
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: then backup everything
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: ok
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: you'll know it when you hear it
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: ok thanks
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: you always help me, i am very greatful
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: thanks
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: i got tired of rma'ing rma's of rma's for my 80gb'er
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: i went through 3 f##ing drives in under a year
[04/18/2005 02:17 PM] Me: jeese
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Me: oh yeah one more thing, have you heard about a CD burner/printer in one from HP?
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: not exactly
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: is that the "lightscribe" one
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Me: supposedly it can laser print onto a CD while its burning
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: wrong and wrong
[04/18/2005 02:18 PM] Me: what does lightscribe do?
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: basically you buy special discs
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: which cost 4x as much
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: and when they are done burning
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: you flip them over
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: and put em back in
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Me: oOo cool
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Me: so there is 4 layers?
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: the laser activates the photosensative dye
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Me: instead of 2?
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: its the top of the cd
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: anyway
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: point being
[04/18/2005 02:19 PM] Me: hmm
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: the image fades
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: in about 6months
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Me: lol
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: it is uv sensative
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Me: what a rip
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: no kidding
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: the burner costs more, it is slower
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Me: i think i'll stick with sharpies
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: you have to flip the fricken disc
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Me: and the occasional paper label
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: which you pay 4x more for
[04/18/2005 02:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: ill stick with buying cheapo spindles and not labeling
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: and if i loose anything ill just reburn it
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Me: exactly
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: with 100packs being $15-$20 who cares ^^
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: (dvd-r's and cd-r's that is)
[04/18/2005 02:21 PM] Me: so which Asus do you like the best?
[04/18/2005 02:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: just get something with socket939 whether it be nforce4 or a via chipset you cant go wrong
[04/18/2005 02:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: I like the Asus A8V a heck of alot
[04/18/2005 02:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: very solid board
[04/18/2005 02:23 PM] Me: i just see the A8V-E
[04/18/2005 02:23 PM] Me: oh
[04/18/2005 02:23 PM] Me: nvm
[04/18/2005 02:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: save diff
[04/18/2005 02:23 PM] Me: i should go with the Agp8x?
[04/18/2005 02:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: well go with the SLI board they have if you want to get 2 gfx cards in the future
[04/18/2005 02:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: (nvidia only at this time though =( )
[04/18/2005 02:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: otherwise go w/ agp
[04/18/2005 02:24 PM] Me: that's fine with me
[04/18/2005 02:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-d/overview.htm)http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8v-d/overview.htm
[04/18/2005 02:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's the board i was refering to
[04/18/2005 02:25 PM] Me: i definitely want a dual lan, 8-channel audio, and SATA
[04/18/2005 02:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: then by all means grab the sli
[04/18/2005 02:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8nsli-d/overview.htm)http://usa.asus.com/products/mb/socket939/a8nsli-d/overview.htm
[04/18/2005 02:28 PM] Me: yeah i like that one
[04/18/2005 02:28 PM] Me: its got the Dual LAN
[04/18/2005 02:29 PM] Me: i'll probably never use the second PCI slot though
[04/18/2005 02:29 PM] Me: what is the Pcix1 and x4 mean?
[04/18/2005 02:29 PM] Nerd Andrew: just small ones
[04/18/2005 02:29 PM] Me: they are smaller, what are they for?
[04/18/2005 02:30 PM] Me: what kind of cards would go in there?
[04/18/2005 02:30 PM] Nerd Andrew: periphials which arnt out yet
[04/18/2005 02:30 PM] Me: oOo sounds usefull
[04/18/2005 02:30 PM] Me: but all the higher end board have them anyways
[04/18/2005 02:30 PM] Nerd Andrew: well just stick with the basics, and make sure to get an E3 stepping socket 939 cpu
[04/18/2005 02:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: (antec psu/case, NEC or pioneer dvd burner, asus mobo, seagate hdds)
[04/18/2005 02:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: and your choice of video card
[04/18/2005 02:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: and you cant go wrong
[04/18/2005 02:32 PM] Me: how about an all in wonder x800 pro?
[04/18/2005 02:32 PM] Me: $500
[04/18/2005 02:32 PM] Me: currently
[04/18/2005 02:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: as i said your call on that one
[04/18/2005 02:32 PM] Me: do you like ATI or GeForce better?
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: i personally like ATI faster, but the chance to do SLI with 2 geforce cards is tempting
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: *better
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: not faster
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] * Nerd Andrew was thinking and typing at the same time
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: bad move
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Me: yeah
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Me: hmmm
[04/18/2005 02:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: (ati for qual, geforce for speed....the geforce cuts things out of rendered scenes in order to make more fps)
[04/18/2005 02:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: which is the reson i don't like em
[04/18/2005 02:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: although ati started showing signs that to compete with nv they might be doing the same kind of things
[04/18/2005 02:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: which makes me sad
[04/18/2005 02:35 PM] Me: so with this A8N-Sli delux i could someday run 2 monitors with 2 separate video boards off the same computer?
[04/18/2005 02:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: essentially....
[04/18/2005 02:35 PM] Me: maybe a new company will prout up from the ATI seeds
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: i do it here with an agp and a pci card
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Me: and they will start this incredibly high quality video boards
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: although the cool thing to do ...only if you get geforce cards
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: is to "SLI" them
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: which is an old technique
[04/18/2005 02:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: of interleaving rendered frames from each video card to one interface
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Me: what are the benefits of that?
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: which makes it virtually 2x faster without taking away image qual 
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Me: oOo
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Me: awesome
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: oh come on
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: that wasn't that cool
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: save your oOo's for good things
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: ^^
[04/18/2005 02:37 PM] Me: ok
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Me: will i need any raid stuff to run 2 SATA seagate drives?
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: all onboard
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Me: ok
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Me: just making sure
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Me: so no extra hardware or anything?
[04/18/2005 02:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you get an antec psu it should have sata power conns onboard
[04/18/2005 02:39 PM] Me: because you used to need it for the version of windows that didn't support or 128GB right?
[04/18/2005 02:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: win xp sp1 will do\
[04/18/2005 02:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: just slipstream a winxp cd with sp1
[04/18/2005 02:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: and you should be set
[04/18/2005 02:39 PM] Me: yeah i know, my step dad has some problems with that
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Me: so does the A8N have that antec psu?
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: mobos don't come with psu
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Me: its the drives that do?
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: cases normally do
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: .me smacks head
[04/18/2005 02:40 PM] Me: oh
[04/18/2005 02:41 PM] * Me confused
[04/18/2005 02:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: just look up "how to build a computer"
[04/18/2005 02:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: or somthing

[04/21/2005 02:07 PM] Me: actually a few
[04/21/2005 02:08 PM] Me: which Antec power supply should i get to go with this case

[04/21/2005 02:08 PM] Me: or should i even get that case
[04/21/2005 02:09 PM] Me: also, what should i do about cooling?  just buy a few Antec fans?  or will any (cheaper) fans work?
[04/21/2005 02:10 PM] Me: is the Asus A8N-SLI Delux even going to fit in that case?
[04/21/2005 02:11 PM] Me: it says standard ATX, and for the power supply it saysATX12V  doesn't that include ATX12V  2.0?
[04/21/2005 02:11 PM] Me: please come back!
[04/21/2005 02:11 PM] Me: help me

[04/21/2005 04:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: I personally would like more ram though
[04/21/2005 04:10 PM] Me: and the power supply?
[04/21/2005 04:10 PM] Me: i don't need that much ram
[04/21/2005 04:10 PM] Me: but how about my power supply?
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: the psu is fine
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Me: and what do i do about cooling?
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Me: just buy some fans?
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Me: the case only comes with 1
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: use the stock cooler that comes with the proc...
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: and add a fan to the back
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Me: the proc?
[04/21/2005 04:11 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you get the retail version of the a64
[04/21/2005 04:12 PM] Nerd Andrew: it comes with a sink
[04/21/2005 04:12 PM] Nerd Andrew: these days i'd probably trade a little cas latency for more ram-ei (Link: http://www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145491)http://www2.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820145491

[04/21/2005 04:13 PM] Me: the case?
[04/21/2005 04:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: the a64
[04/21/2005 04:13 PM] Me: <-- use stupid people terms
[04/21/2005 04:13 PM] Nerd Andrew: comes with a cpu heatsink and fan
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Me: oh
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you buy the boxed (retail) version
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Me: yes
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Me: that's what i have on there
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Me: so that will be enough cooling?
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: i think so
[04/21/2005 04:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: the psu has a 120mm fan in it
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: and the case comes with a fan right?
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Me: yes
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: i think you are fine
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Me: because people on the postings for the board are talking about using water cooling and PCI slots for cooling fans and such
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: the x600 doesn't put out much heat
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: you don't need water for a64's
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: trust me
[04/21/2005 04:15 PM] Me: ok
[04/21/2005 04:16 PM] Me: oh yeah one more thing, how come there aren't any board for AMD that support for then DDR400?
[04/21/2005 04:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: no need
[04/21/2005 04:16 PM] Nerd Andrew: ddr533(in ddr2 form) is just higher latency
[04/21/2005 04:16 PM] Me: really?
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Me: i c
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: plus you can always just overclock the memory bus a little
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: ;)
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Me: yeah but i'd rather not overclock
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: but at least get 1gb (512mb x 2 so you can gain access to the dual chan mem controller)
[04/21/2005 04:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's worth it
[04/21/2005 04:18 PM] Me: people on the postings for the mobo are saying i have to update the bios, will that be hard to figure out?
[04/21/2005 04:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: and if you use XP, you are guananteed to be paging with 512mb or less ram
[04/21/2005 04:18 PM] Me: also they can't get windows installed on the first try
[04/21/2005 04:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: no biggie...get a dos booting (win 98 boot floppy) put the awardbios......wit a sec

[04/21/2005 04:19 PM] Me: ok
[04/21/2005 04:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: then it is as simple as typing awdflash biosfilename.bin
[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: and enter and following the menus
[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Me: yes i am getting 1GB of ram
[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: (from dos)
[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: good....i was scared at 512mb

[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Me: yeah
[04/21/2005 04:20 PM] Me: i meant to put 2 on there
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: good
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Me: but i don't need 2GB
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Me: that's over the top for me
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: eh, i built one with 2gb recenlty
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: it screams

[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Me: cool
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it was cheap too
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Me: compared to what i have now, this new one will already scream
[04/21/2005 04:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: i paid $260 for 1gbx2

[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: i would wait about a month if i were you
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: AMD plans to have the dual core a64's out by then
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Me: then don't they have to make new motherboard?
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: that's the beuty
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Me: or will it still be socket 939?
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: yep
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Me: wow
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it will use all the old boards too
[04/21/2005 04:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: all that will be needed is a bios updater
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: *update
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: they've planned it from the beginning of the conception of the hammer archetecture
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Me: but this Asus i want right now, says it supports AMD Athlon, does it really support opteron too?
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: (back in 1999)
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: opteron is socket 940
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: and costs more
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Me: oh
[04/21/2005 04:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: and only uses ECC ram
[04/21/2005 04:25 PM] Me: but if they are making dual core opterons i will have to find a new board
[04/21/2005 04:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: but you can do up to 8 (but we are talking BIG BUCKS) cpu optys
[04/21/2005 04:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: they are out now

[05/04/2005 08:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: laptops are very proprietary
[05/04/2005 08:33 PM] Me: i figured
[05/04/2005 08:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: each one has a radically different lcd than another
[05/04/2005 08:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: if it's like a P3 or early p4 or a k6/2 or below (ei pentiums and below included), it's not worth fixing
[05/04/2005 08:35 PM] Me: i figured
[05/04/2005 08:35 PM] Me: but my friend is getting a brocken laptop for free
[05/04/2005 08:35 PM] Me: so as long as he can find a fix for less then it is worth, he might do it
[05/04/2005 08:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: usually lcd's end up costing like $130-$250 used 
[05/04/2005 08:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: and that's only if it is a popular model
[05/04/2005 08:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: labor is another issue and completely dependent on what laptop it is...Ive done it before, but it is very easy to fuck something up in the process if you know what I mean
[05/04/2005 08:36 PM] Me: hmm ok, he might want to spend around that much
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Me: i will let him know

[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: trust me...its a bitch
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Me: you think it is that hard?
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: lots of little little screws, 
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Me: unscrew stuff and unplug the old one right?
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[05/04/2005 08:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: you have to worry about the invertor
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Me: invertor?
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: which goes to the cold cathode tube
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: which is the backlight
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: and about 100 other thingz
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Me: hmm
[05/04/2005 08:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: there are usually 7 micro plugs similar to ones you would see if you opened up a older style PS2 if you know what i mean
[05/04/2005 08:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: on the lcd pannel assembly
[05/04/2005 08:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: usually about 32 screws hole the assemby in place
[05/04/2005 08:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: 16 of them will be hidden
[05/04/2005 08:39 PM] Me: sounds hard
[05/04/2005 08:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: and generally you will have plastic tabs too

[05/04/2005 08:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: stay away from tomshardwareguide
[05/04/2005 08:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: (aka toms fagware)
[05/04/2005 08:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: and take everything you read with a grain of salt
[05/04/2005 08:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: everyone can be bought out these days
[05/04/2005 08:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: and when it comes to graphics cards, any bench can be cheated
[05/04/2005 08:44 PM] Me: hmmm

[05/04/2005 08:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: Thg....is located....right next door to germany's intel headquarters
[05/04/2005 08:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: they don't do their research, but rather swallow all the coorperate advertising they are given
[05/04/2005 08:45 PM] Me: hmmm
[05/04/2005 08:46 PM] Me: that's not good
[05/04/2005 08:46 PM] Me: what sites are good?
[05/04/2005 08:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: anandtech has been generally good, but even from them you will see a biased review every so often

[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: tough too
[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Me: but way to expensive for me
[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: i use a lot of seagates here
[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Me: and i saw a new seagate 400GB for affordable price
[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Me: in the fry's add
[05/04/2005 08:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: never had one go bad, very happy with them

[05/04/2005 08:50 PM] Me: and how come no 16MB seagates?
[05/04/2005 08:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: well, scsi takes care of it
[05/04/2005 08:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: you wouldn't need it in most cases
[05/04/2005 08:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: (plus the more cache, generally the slower that cache is)
[05/04/2005 08:52 PM] Me: scsi?
[05/04/2005 08:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[05/04/2005 08:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: SCSI

[05/04/2005 08:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: hehehe\
[05/04/2005 08:53 PM] Me: just a regular baracuda sata
[05/04/2005 08:54 PM] Me: do i need a motherboard that supports it or will if fit the usual 68pin?
[05/04/2005 08:54 PM] Me: or 50pin?
[05/04/2005 08:54 PM] Me: nvm
[05/04/2005 08:54 PM] Me: <-- dumb question

[05/06/2005 12:05 PM] Me: i think that means even longer loading times for macromedia, and better web applications for adobe
[05/06/2005 12:07 PM] Me: adobe takes forever to load, i hate it, even to view a stupid document on a website, it sucks and completely defeates the purpose of having a high speed internet, if its not the connection that will get you, its the processor usuage from adobe trying to load a dozen times a day, not to mention the 50mbs of memory it takes up, for us 512 mb people that's a lot, no playing video games... :-(  they aren't going to be a good combination

[06/22/2005 11:32 PM] Me: should i get one of those? i can't believe they are advertising on tv

[06/22/2005 11:32 PM] Me: they aren't on the market yet
[06/22/2005 11:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: try one and you will never look back

[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Me: oh
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Me: but the Asus board won't support it
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: actually
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: any socket 940 board will support the opty
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: the a64 X2's will be arriving in good quantities in a month
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: for all socket 939 boards
[06/22/2005 11:33 PM] Me: but asus says it supports the 939
[06/22/2005 11:34 PM] Me: should i get one of those?
[06/22/2005 11:34 PM] Me: a64 x2?
[06/22/2005 11:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah

[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Me: lol
[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Me: omg
[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Me: i don't want to pay for that
[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: now I have to build up my new linux firewall...I'm going to try IPCOP first since I've heard good things about it
[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Me: where do you get this funding?
[06/22/2005 11:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: well im actually putting it off right this sec

[06/22/2005 11:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: after a 80% failure rate(!)
[06/22/2005 11:36 PM] Me: the click of death and crashing 3 times a day

[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: i want a scsi rack
[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: filled with 500gb nearlines
[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Me: after using my friends 300gb maxtor external that really turned me on
[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Me: yeah we all want one of those but i can't afford it
[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: i'm installing gentoo on my lappy now
[06/22/2005 11:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: (even the 64bit version yay me)
[06/22/2005 11:41 PM] Me: anywho my friend had this external, i never knew they were so easy to use

[06/22/2005 11:41 PM] Me: yeah?
[06/22/2005 11:42 PM] Nerd Andrew: 4 NICS, p3 450 like the current one, an extra pci slot for another nic, and a 2gb hdd
[06/22/2005 11:42 PM] Nerd Andrew: one nic is gonna go to wireless...i've finally figured out a "safe" way of doing it
[06/22/2005 11:42 PM] Nerd Andrew: im isolating the wifi from everything-except the net, and only certain ports at that
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Me: wow
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Me: that's some good stuff
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Me: good luck with that
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: it is going to be so isolated that to talk to my network it will have to go to the external IP addy
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Me: i could never master the ways of linux
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: i love it
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: absolutely
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Me: that's the kind of setup you pirate software on
[06/22/2005 11:43 PM] Nerd Andrew: no
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's the kinda setup which doesn't crash
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Me: lol
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: or act funky
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: or need reboots once in a while
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: the driver support is a tad lacking due to hardware manufacturer's wanting to keep their secrets secret
[06/22/2005 11:44 PM] Nerd Andrew: but i think that will pass
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Me: yeah
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's only a matter of time before we see a open source video card (rofl)
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Me: lol
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Me: i'm sure you could find an old one
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: i've gotten into astronomy and plan to get me a nice telescope
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Me: really?
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: im going to automate it and motorize it myself
[06/22/2005 11:45 PM] Me: what about that radio thing?
[06/22/2005 11:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: well, for now that's been put on hold due to my design requiring some very hard to find (and expencive when you do) parts
[06/22/2005 11:46 PM] Me: ah
[06/22/2005 11:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: plus i can't decide to do a tube setup or a treansistor setup
[06/22/2005 11:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: both would cost a bundle
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: i'd learn more doing tube
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: but tubes are such a hassle
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Me: anywhere you can come up with the money?
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Me: no private funding?
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: well i g2g got school still

[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: $250 to remove spyware says their poster
[06/22/2005 11:47 PM] Me: lol
[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Me: bs
[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Me: i'll do it for free

[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Me: that's where the + skill comes in
[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Me: me too, the market is really skyrocketing
[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: once i get em setup with mozilla and (after usually the 3rd trip) getting them using it
[06/22/2005 11:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: they thank me

[06/22/2005 11:49 PM] Me: omg
[06/22/2005 11:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: in this house it was awful
[06/22/2005 11:49 PM] Me: i like dreamweaver and notpad
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: I prefer VI now oddly
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: whats with the merge with adobe and macromedia?
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: and I have no clue why
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: VI sucks
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: but i like it =/
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: yeah it does
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: I don't get it
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: whats with the merge with adobe and macromedia?
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: ~eh
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: heard anything on it?
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: longer loading times for macromedia
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: i think everything will remain the same
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: yeah probably
[06/22/2005 11:50 PM] Me: adobe just wants their web stuff
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Me: its the only thing they don't have
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: macromedia might become slower loading though on pc's (joke for adobe guys)
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: actually they have page stuff
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Me: really?
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Me: i didn't know
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: and i prefer adobe's solution to dreamweaver
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: it makes less sloppy code
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Me: hmm
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Me: i'll have to take a look
[06/22/2005 11:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: but either way

[06/23/2005 12:14 AM] Me: my dad ordered the laptop before our discussion tonight and i went online to voodoo to retrieve my system and realized i got the hitachi 80gb instead of the seagate 100gb
[06/23/2005 12:15 AM] Me: is that bad?  if so how hard would it be to replace the drive?  i watched you do it before linux class all the time so it must not be that hard, do you think the hitachi is still a bad choice?

[06/23/2005 12:30 PM] Me: thanks that makes me feel better about my purchase
[06/23/2005 12:30 PM] Me: switched over to geforce yet or still have faith in ati?
[06/23/2005 12:31 PM] Me: when is ati gonna come out with some Sli's?
[06/23/2005 12:31 PM] Nerd Andrew: still w/ ati... 
[06/23/2005 12:31 PM] Me: i'm thinking about switching over
[06/23/2005 12:32 PM] Me: i mean my laptop is gonna intel and i hear intel and geforce work well together
[06/23/2005 12:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: where did you hear that?
[06/23/2005 12:32 PM] Me: someone was just talking about it
[06/23/2005 12:32 PM] Nerd Andrew: sounds like a quack to me
[06/23/2005 12:32 PM] Me: maybe
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Me: still no all-in-wonder x800 pci-e though
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: I find that both ati and geforce cards do fine no matter what they are put on
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Me: yeah probably
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Me: so do you like the sli on geforce?
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: well yes and no
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: I've played around with it, 
[06/23/2005 12:33 PM] Nerd Andrew: but I still find the image quality lacking
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Me: is it easy to set up?
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Me: really lacking how?
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes and no
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's extremely fussy
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: lacking in quality
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: ei pieces of renderings missing and/or blacked out
[06/23/2005 12:34 PM] Nerd Andrew: sure the speed is just flipping fantastic
[06/23/2005 12:35 PM] Nerd Andrew: but i've got to say, I prefer my 9700pro's "performance" settings to a dual 6800's "high" quality
[06/23/2005 12:36 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 12:36 PM] Me: played with any of the new x000 yet?
[06/23/2005 12:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: nope
[06/23/2005 12:36 PM] Nerd Andrew: played with an x800pro though
[06/23/2005 12:36 PM] Me: how come?
[06/23/2005 12:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: i've been extremely busy
[06/23/2005 12:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: plus they are damn rare
[06/23/2005 12:37 PM] Me: rare?
[06/23/2005 12:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: the x850 pt's
[06/23/2005 12:37 PM] Nerd Andrew: right?
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: is that what you are refering to?
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Me: any of the x series
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: oh
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: just an x800pro
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Me: but yeah i've heard of the x850s
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: very nice card btw
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: (AGP version btw)
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Me: yeah i hope they come out with an AIW x800 pci-e soon
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Nerd Andrew: i doubt it
[06/23/2005 12:38 PM] Me: really?
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Me: ... bummer
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: pci-e has a few issu
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: es
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: which need to be hammered out
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: just like the original AGP
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Nerd Andrew: or PCI for that matter
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Me: yeah but i can't not get a pci-e
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Me: the asus board is pci-e only
[06/23/2005 12:39 PM] Me: and its supposed to be a lot faster
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: it isnt
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: havent we had this discussion before?
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Me: but i didn't believe you
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: ...... no surprise there
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's true
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: no video card, even oc'd
[06/23/2005 12:40 PM] Nerd Andrew: can take advantage of a Agp2x's bandwidth
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: and I am dead serious
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Me: ok
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: the only thing pci-e has that agp doesn't is the capability to put another card in
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: which is really cool
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Me: then should i not get the asus board?
[06/23/2005 12:41 PM] Nerd Andrew: either way you are good
[06/23/2005 12:42 PM] Me: except i would have to get an AIW X600
[06/23/2005 12:42 PM] Me: pci-e
[06/23/2005 12:42 PM] Me: do these 6800s have a tv tuner?
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: huh?
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: i don't think any 6800's do
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: (6800 is a nvidia
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Me: yeah
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Me: i am wondering how they compare to the AIW
[06/23/2005 12:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: thye dont
[06/23/2005 12:47 PM] Me: do they have any series with a tv tuner?
[06/23/2005 12:48 PM] Me: ah here is it
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: hang on i g2g
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Me: should i get a socket 939 board?
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes they do
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: but it's software blows
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Nerd Andrew: chunks
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Me: lol
[06/23/2005 12:51 PM] Me: should i get a socket 939 board?
[06/23/2005 12:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes
[06/23/2005 12:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: g2g now

[06/28/2005 09:44 PM] Me: Hi Andrew
[06/28/2005 09:44 PM] Me: I need your help again.
[06/28/2005 09:45 PM] Me: Only this time I believe you will be far more interested.
[06/28/2005 09:45 PM] Me: It isn't the usual hardware problems.
[06/28/2005 09:45 PM] Me: This time it is software.
[06/28/2005 09:45 PM] Nerd Andrew: k-let's hear it
[06/28/2005 09:45 PM] Me: I want to start modding for the PSP
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: cool....
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Me: I believe I have all of the correct and necessary tools.  But I am lacking the knowledge.
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: you need to figure out how to add a usb controller
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Me: lol
[06/28/2005 09:46 PM] Nerd Andrew: google is usually your friend when it copes to that
[06/28/2005 09:47 PM] Me: no much more complicated
[06/28/2005 09:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: *comes
[06/28/2005 09:47 PM] Me: google cannot handle my queries
[06/28/2005 09:47 PM] Nerd Andrew: what you trying to do?
[06/28/2005 09:47 PM] Me: i have the PSP build of CodeWarrior, and the PSP SDK
[06/28/2005 09:48 PM] Me: i must be brief, as you can see there is good reason
[06/28/2005 09:48 PM] Me: I cannot get the C libraries to load properly and i am not very experienced in the language
[06/28/2005 09:48 PM] Nerd Andrew: ic
[06/28/2005 09:48 PM] Me: Most of the Readme files are pretty far over my head
[06/28/2005 09:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: Well I never even thought about coding for any of those types of things and it only has started to look good to do so recently-
[06/28/2005 09:49 PM] Nerd Andrew: unfourtunatly i think those readme's are over MY head
[06/28/2005 09:49 PM] Me: but you are intrigued correct?
[06/28/2005 09:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[06/28/2005 09:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: then again I picked up a Leapfrog Leapster at a thrift shop for $6
[06/28/2005 09:50 PM] Nerd Andrew: and am thinking of doing the same to it
[06/28/2005 09:50 PM] Me: in that case would you be able to find an opening in your very busy schedule for a meeting sometime within the next few weeks?
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: i would like to put together a team
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: not to overthrow sony's empire
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: but for our own personal benefit and knowledge
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: ensuring a bright future for our programming skills
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: we must keep up with the times
[06/28/2005 09:51 PM] Me: and the times are calling to me and a few others
[06/28/2005 09:52 PM] Nerd Andrew: i see your point and you are on the right track
[06/28/2005 09:52 PM] Me: as you know, this is a very profitable industry but only with knowledge may any of us take advantage of future opportunities
[06/28/2005 09:53 PM] Me: i know that you are very passionate about your work, and if you are not able to answer our questions a little guidance would still be very beneficial and appreciated 
[06/28/2005 09:53 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah-unfourtunatly I too am going for the never ending quest for knowledge, have a stack of books 8x my height to read, and just got interested in astronomy
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: ok I'll see what little I can do to help you guys out
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Me: wonderful
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: first of all, at least for the beginning you have to realize a few things
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: the platform you picked is not very open, and just like writing device drivers for linux, it will be tough sledding
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Nerd Andrew: by guess, by gosh, and by golly
[06/28/2005 09:54 PM] Me: i will speak to my associate, and with the arrival of my laptop in a few days we will put together some examples and outlines of what we are intending to do
[06/28/2005 09:55 PM] Me: we understand
[06/28/2005 09:55 PM] Me: which is why we need all the help we can get
[06/28/2005 09:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: I would start searching for various stumbling blocks encoutered by others
[06/28/2005 09:55 PM] Nerd Andrew: i'm sure they are a-plenty
[06/28/2005 09:55 PM] Me: after i speak with him maybe we can meet some afternoon whenever it is convenient for you to discuss
[06/28/2005 09:56 PM] Me: yes there is much research left to be done
[06/28/2005 09:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://www.psp-linux.org/forums/index.php?act=idx)http://www.psp-linux.org/forums/index.php?act=idx
[06/28/2005 09:56 PM] Nerd Andrew: this might be a good place to start
[06/28/2005 09:56 PM] Me: yes i have started here
[06/28/2005 09:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: looks like plenty of good info
[06/28/2005 09:57 PM] Nerd Andrew: and they are trying to do something huge
[06/28/2005 09:58 PM] Me: then we are not alone.  Sony has done nothing but hinder creativity by being proprietary and secretive, they have only delayed what is inevitable
[06/28/2005 09:58 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: hopefully this sort of thing will yield in something totally different
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: - an open sourced hardware platform
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Me: hopefully it will start an open source revolution
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: well it is there
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: but the hardware end of it
[06/28/2005 09:59 PM] Nerd Andrew: has not taken the steps it needs to
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Me: i agree
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: although AMD did sue Intel today
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: (woot!)
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Me: lol y?
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: unfair business pracs
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Me: wow
[06/28/2005 10:00 PM] Nerd Andrew: such as when bestbuy started selling AMD machines delayed their checks
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Me: omfg
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: and now pay them to MAKE SURE that 90% of machines are Intel
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Me: that's unacceptable
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: Japan sued their asses and won already
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: the EU is going after their asses
[06/28/2005 10:01 PM] Nerd Andrew: and now AMD is too
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Me: so its bad that my new laptop will have an Intel?
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: what they did to compaq was more interesting
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Me: because VooDoo doesn't offer AMD
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: they do
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Me: what did they do?
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Me: its not on their current line of products
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes it is
[06/28/2005 10:02 PM] Nerd Andrew: gime a sec
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: EI
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: (Link: http://voodoopc.com/sellPage.aspx?productID=1069)http://voodoopc.com/sellPage.aspx?productID=1069
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: let me find their lighter one
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Me: how are you finding these?
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Me: they aren't advertised
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: on their website
[06/28/2005 10:04 PM] Nerd Andrew: =/
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Me: yeah but they removed the links to them
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: no they didnt
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Me: and this one doesn't have the new XATIs
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: truthfully it don't matter
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: just pci-x vs. AGP
[06/28/2005 10:05 PM] Nerd Andrew: and in the mobile parket
[06/28/2005 10:06 PM] Nerd Andrew: (pci-ex anyway)
[06/28/2005 10:06 PM] Nerd Andrew: the agp versions are still faster
[06/28/2005 10:06 PM] Me: but the one i have picked out has a better resolution
[06/28/2005 10:06 PM] Nerd Andrew: bigger res just means smaller text when running native
[06/28/2005 10:06 PM] Nerd Andrew: how big is your screen?
[06/28/2005 10:07 PM] Me: 15.4
[06/28/2005 10:07 PM] Nerd Andrew: res is?
[06/28/2005 10:07 PM] Me: no res is 1900,1200
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] * Nerd Andrew feels a little sorry for your eyes
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Me: lol
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Me: is this lappy a heavy weight?
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: they had a MW
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Me: yeah its gone
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Nerd Andrew: I just cant find it
[06/28/2005 10:08 PM] Me: should i get this one instead?
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Me: i have until tomorrow to decide
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Me: and its got to be final
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Me: i like green
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Me: but there is no car adapter?
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: just use an invertor
[06/28/2005 10:09 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Me: yeah...
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: $30
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: ain't no big deal
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Me: so this is better?
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: the car adaptors generally cost $99
[06/28/2005 10:10 PM] Nerd Andrew: or more
[06/28/2005 10:11 PM] Me: so this is a better laptop...
[06/28/2005 10:12 PM] Me: should i get the additional AC adapter?
[06/28/2005 10:12 PM] Nerd Andrew: depends on what you are gonna use it for
[06/28/2005 10:12 PM] Nerd Andrew: I don't see any reason
[06/28/2005 10:12 PM] Me: should i get the seagate momentus drive?
[06/28/2005 10:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah they are nice
[06/28/2005 10:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: I got one of my linux drives
[06/28/2005 10:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: but travelstars are good too
[06/28/2005 10:14 PM] Nerd Andrew: I still think the best damn deal is this thing right here

[06/28/2005 10:15 PM] Nerd Andrew: only that one had 1gb ram
[06/28/2005 10:17 PM] Me: are the video boards built on to the mother boards?
[06/28/2005 10:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: the way I always see it is I could get 2 of these (Link: http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Gateway/M520/3501915nv.jpg)http://support.gateway.com/s/Mobile/Gateway/M520/3501915nv.jpg
[06/28/2005 10:17 PM] Nerd Andrew: yeah

[07/05/2005 04:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: put it in a ziplock with a packet of silca gel (can be found in beef jerky bags and shoeboxes) for 30mins or so-
[07/05/2005 04:29 PM] Nerd Andrew: have a computer which boots up quickly and has plenty o' free space handy and turn it off, take the hdd out of the freezer and out of the bag, stand it up sideways, hook it up (while still cold) to the secondary channel (remove the cd rom drive and anything else on that channel), boot up, and if the drive comes up, copy the cruicial stuff over first and be fast about it-you have 5 mins at the least, 30mins at the max
