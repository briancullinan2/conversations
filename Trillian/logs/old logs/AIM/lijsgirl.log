[04/28/2005 11:11 PM] Krista: this guy in my art class came to the conclusion that he is gay, lol he was like if a girl asked me out iwould go out i mean whats the harm, he was like yah the only girl that ever asked me out i ended up marrying, then he was like it wouldnt work out between us would it ...and i was like no ......he is older then my dad....that is just weird
[04/28/2005 11:13 PM] Me: wow
[04/28/2005 11:13 PM] Me: that's strange

[04/28/2005 11:14 PM] Krista: yah i dont think that my stand partner gets that the phone works both ways
[04/28/2005 11:15 PM] Me: lol
[04/28/2005 11:16 PM] Krista: he is just in the orchestra for fun he is really good and it pisses me off cause it makes my sound like i suck really bad, but oh well, he drownds me out lol, he already graduated from uofa and he supposedly has not played his instrument forthe past three years i was like liar because he is good.he is way better then our concert mistress lol but he sits almost last chair, well there isnt really assigned chairs but the concert mistress thinks shes the best

[04/28/2005 11:18 PM] Me: most the girls there are so immature, i don't want to be around them
[04/28/2005 11:19 PM] Krista: so the professor just moved him now to second violin, because we need seconds for the concert before we didnt have any and we had 5 first violins, so the professor was like yah ill have u be 2nd violin with mrs. chesser to balance out the firsts, which now are just 4 girls and he was like oh i can handle them all by my self no problem...and the whole orchestra was like oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh....it was funny then the firsts were like some ones getting beat down after class....of course nothing happened because hes like way taller then any of us and we couldnt do anything to him anyways
[04/28/2005 11:20 PM] Me: lol
[04/28/2005 11:20 PM] Krista: yah i didnt have any bf's at all during highschool, i asked out two guys, one said yes but then never actually committed to going out anywhere, the other just got in a relationship a couple days before i asked or else he would have
[04/28/2005 11:20 PM] Me: how tall are you now, its been so long?
[04/28/2005 11:20 PM] Krista: but i actually only have had one boy friend and it was in kindergarden so i dont know if that even counts lol

[04/28/2005 11:22 PM] Me: even though i really meant that it was attractive not just another trait
[04/28/2005 11:22 PM] Krista: yah people assume that some times that i hate being called cute and when people say im short, im like yah so... i like being short its awesome
[04/28/2005 11:22 PM] Krista: yah
[04/28/2005 11:23 PM] Krista: my one friend gets mad when u call her cute shes like i want to be hot not cute god dam it its funny
[04/28/2005 11:23 PM] Me: yeah, i wish i was a little taller though, guys are the opposite, they want to be big so they can survive in the gene pool
[04/28/2005 11:23 PM] Me: lol yeah some girls find it offensive if you call them hot
[04/28/2005 11:24 PM] Me: well not really any of the girls at pinnacle

[04/28/2005 11:29 PM] Me: i wish i was 5' 11"
[04/28/2005 11:30 PM] Krista: but thats how it goes most people who are short want to be tall and people with curly hair want straight and straight want curly , short want long, long want short, and so on
