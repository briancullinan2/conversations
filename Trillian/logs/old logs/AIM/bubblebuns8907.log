bubblebuns8907: shut up
bubblebuns8907: move on to other people thats ok i told u to do that before but never talk bad about her
BrianJCullinan: why shouldn't i
BrianJCullinan: she is so immature, couldn't she realize what that was doing to me?
bubblebuns8907: because she is my friend and she is not a bitch and the only reason u r saying that is becaues u r mad
BrianJCullinan: i'm not mad
bubblebuns8907: get over her!
BrianJCullinan: the only reason i called her a bitch is because that what she is, she did just to anger me and that is definantly a bitch thing to do

bubblebuns8907: well if thats the way it has to be
BrianJCullinan: i'm not trying to be any part of her life, but when she talks to me, and yells at me, and argues with me, and sits behind me all the time, and then sits on my best friends lap right infront of me, i pretty sure i'm in her life, and i have pretty good reason to think she is a bitch
bubblebuns8907: then keep that to your self she is my best friend how did u expect me to react to that and stop calling her a bitch!
