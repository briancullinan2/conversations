[04/18/2005 08:18 PM] Me: with Pentium i would get more bang for my buck, but AMD is the leader in gaming processing, they come out higher on the benchmarks for games, but lower on most applications
[04/18/2005 08:19 PM] Me: AMD is lots more expensive

[04/30/2005 12:35 PM] Me: did i go all the way through the recovery?
[04/30/2005 12:35 PM] Me: and then at the end it is giving you a prompt?
[04/30/2005 12:36 PM] Dan F: i guess so, i dont think it did recovery yet, it asked me which windows volume to fix, and asked for the password
[04/30/2005 12:36 PM] Dan F: when i enter the password it said its invalid
[04/30/2005 12:36 PM] Me: hmm

[04/30/2005 12:37 PM] Me: is this a prebuilt computer?
[04/30/2005 12:37 PM] Dan F: yes it is, and instead of entering a password, i just hit enter, and it gave me the command promtp
[04/30/2005 12:38 PM] Dan F: it is a prebuilt comp
[04/30/2005 12:38 PM] Me: hmm
[04/30/2005 12:38 PM] Me: that's very strange

[05/11/2005 06:56 PM] Dan F: god brian
[05/11/2005 06:56 PM] Me: there were two guys, a driver and a passenger in a towncar

[05/11/2005 06:57 PM] Me: the driver says keep it up here for 15 minutes while i go change, the passenger comes back and says that's my car i get the keys and a last name
[05/11/2005 06:58 PM] Me: he gives me the last name on the keys, he goes and gets his haircut
[05/11/2005 06:58 PM] Dan F: did the name check out when you verified it?
[05/11/2005 06:58 PM] Me: 10 minutes later the original driver comes down and trys to get the same car, but i already gave it away to his friend that didn't even tell the driver he was taking it
[05/11/2005 06:58 PM] Dan F: oh thats bs
[05/11/2005 06:58 PM] Me: i didn't get an ID, that's where i made my mistake

[05/11/2005 06:59 PM] Dan F: oh ok
[05/11/2005 06:59 PM] Dan F: did he have a claim ticket?
[05/11/2005 07:00 PM] Me: but had it been a 15 minute, and they were just not valeting with us, should i have gotten an id then?  the passenger did not, that's why i got a last name, the driver did have the claim ticket
[05/11/2005 07:00 PM] Me: but i knew they were together
[05/11/2005 07:00 PM] Me: i just got the two guys mixed up
[05/11/2005 07:01 PM] Dan F: ok i see where you are comming from, but at a DS point of view you should have aksed for a claim ticket, and in that case you needed to check a photo ID

[05/11/2005 07:04 PM] Me: but i made 12 dollars in tips

[05/11/2005 07:12 PM] Me: Conrad called Matt and no doubt made it sound worse then it really was
[05/11/2005 07:12 PM] Dan F: i wouldnt dout it
[05/11/2005 07:12 PM] Me: and he most likely didn't explain the whole thing about how they were riding together and it was currently a 15 minute
[05/11/2005 07:13 PM] Dan F: well explain that to matt, but im not sure if its gunna help
[05/11/2005 07:14 PM] Me: i am gonna use that in my argument, then i am gonna tell him to get a valet like you to ask all the other guys if they check ID for ever 15 minute tag, and if more then ten guys say no, then there is no reason i should lose my job over this
[05/11/2005 07:14 PM] Me: because it really was currently a 15 minute tag
[05/11/2005 07:14 PM] Me: i like your icon by the way

[05/11/2005 07:15 PM] Dan F: lol thanks, and yeah for 15 minutes you are supposed check id at all times, but everyone just goes by jugement, meaning if somthing looks suspicious then check id
[05/11/2005 07:15 PM] Me: i went by judgement and now i am paying for it
[05/11/2005 07:16 PM] Me: i'm gonna have to find a new job for over the summer

[06/21/2005 12:03 PM] Me: the tag editor is better then i thought, it really does remove the tags now, instead of just leave them blank, must have been an older version that did that
[06/21/2005 12:03 PM] Me: i have a progrm
[06/21/2005 12:03 PM] Me: program
[06/21/2005 12:03 PM] Dan F: what program
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Me: dbpowerAmp by Illustrate
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Dan F: freeware?
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Dan F: i want it
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Me: its kind of free
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Me: i use the extensions that cost money
[06/21/2005 12:04 PM] Me: they allow me to edit as many tags on files as i want
[06/21/2005 12:05 PM] Me: you can add any tag you want
[06/21/2005 12:05 PM] Me: if i wanted to put a Color tag on ever mp3 i had, i could do it
[06/21/2005 12:05 PM] Me: and it comes with a whole bunch of other things like voice removal or music removal
[06/21/2005 12:05 PM] Dan F: cool
[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Me: or adding fades to the end of a song, it copies and converts every different kind of file
[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Dan F: sweet
[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Me: i can convert from wav to mp3 to music video

[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Me: yes
[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Dan F: does this program have a website
[06/21/2005 12:06 PM] Me: it can convert bit rates and frequency and number of chanels and stereo type
[06/21/2005 12:07 PM] Me: (Link: http://dbpoweramp.com/)http://dbpoweramp.com/
[06/21/2005 12:07 PM] Dan F: its the music converter right
[06/21/2005 12:07 PM] Me: and the codecs are always being updated
[06/21/2005 12:07 PM] Me: so if one doesn't work right away just look for a new version
[06/21/2005 12:07 PM] Me: yes
[06/21/2005 12:08 PM] Dan F: sick
[06/21/2005 12:08 PM] Dan F: imma try this
[06/21/2005 12:08 PM] Me: i haven't tried this AccurateRip stuff
[06/21/2005 12:09 PM] Me: it makes it so that depending on a CD and the cd drive you are using like company specific it will spin it up a certain number of times and start at a very precise position on the cd
[06/21/2005 12:12 PM] Dan F: so you have to buy the tag editor
[06/21/2005 12:12 PM] Me: yeah i can give you the code though
[06/21/2005 12:13 PM] Me: shit actually just download it from my server

[06/21/2005 02:52 PM] Me: what is the different between Stereo and Joint-Stereo?
[06/21/2005 02:53 PM] Dan F: i believe joint stereo is having the same signal from both left and right speakers, whereas stereo has different sounds coming from each speaker
[06/21/2005 02:53 PM] Me: damnit
[06/21/2005 02:53 PM] Me: why would greg copy all his music joint?
[06/21/2005 02:53 PM] Dan F: but check i may be wrong
[06/21/2005 02:53 PM] Dan F: well i may be wrong
[06/21/2005 02:55 PM] Dan F: i was wrong and right
[06/21/2005 02:55 PM] Me: well that's lost data that can't be converted back
[06/21/2005 02:55 PM] Dan F: joint stereo has left and right, but any information that is the same for both is not included, resulting in a smaller file size
[06/21/2005 02:56 PM] Me: ah
[06/21/2005 02:56 PM] Dan F: so its good
[06/21/2005 02:56 PM] Me: yeah

[06/21/2005 02:56 PM] Me: two different sides is very important in this day
[06/21/2005 02:57 PM] Dan F: very important
[06/21/2005 02:57 PM] Me: so then what happens to the sound between both of them?
[06/21/2005 02:57 PM] Me: is it just in the middle
[06/21/2005 02:57 PM] Me: likes its included in the file but not included twice on both sides?
[06/21/2005 02:58 PM] Dan F: exactly
[06/21/2005 02:58 PM] Me: ok perfect

[06/21/2005 03:00 PM] Me: its another thing that comes with dbpoweramp
[06/21/2005 03:00 PM] Me: the file selector, you can select as many files as you want to convert and it creates a big huge list
[06/21/2005 03:00 PM] Me: then you just convert it one after another

[06/28/2005 02:00 PM] Dan F: like what?
[06/28/2005 02:00 PM] Me: first the DVD+ even worked on my portable DVD player which isn't supposed to be able to play DVD-+
[06/28/2005 02:00 PM] Dan F: lol nice
[06/28/2005 02:00 PM] Dan F: what else?
[06/28/2005 02:00 PM] Me: i reinstalled with what i think was the right directory set up for the CodeWarrior
[06/28/2005 02:01 PM] Dan F: you included the sdk for the psp and the emulator?
[06/28/2005 02:01 PM] Me: yes
[06/28/2005 02:02 PM] Dan F: and it was fine with it?
[06/28/2005 02:02 PM] Me: i even found a license hack in a forum, the stupid bastards use a license >FILE< (big mistake) written by FlexLM
[06/28/2005 02:02 PM] Dan F: ohhh very nice
[06/28/2005 02:02 PM] Me: so the next thing was i started a project using the plug-in for .NET (YES!!!)  and now i can run the compiler
[06/28/2005 02:03 PM] Dan F: all the libraries were included for .net??
[06/28/2005 02:03 PM] Me: that's the next problems
[06/28/2005 02:03 PM] Me: the next problem is the 2800 compiler errors
[06/28/2005 02:03 PM] Dan F: ok thats because the lib files arnt included right
[06/28/2005 02:03 PM] Me: yes
[06/28/2005 02:04 PM] Me: the wizard came up with some code and even wrote a nice sub_main for me
[06/28/2005 02:04 PM] Me: but the libraries are messed up, it is reffering to the PSP stdio (for example) but .NET thinks it means the C++ stdio
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Me: that's where most of the errors come from
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Dan F: fuck
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Me: besides that there is one more problem
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Dan F: hmmmmm
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Me: there is a folder for the SCE SDKs for the Emulator, and only 1 file can be found out of 10
[06/28/2005 02:05 PM] Me: i even did a search through windows for file names and there is nothing
[06/28/2005 02:06 PM] Me: not even wrong locations, they just aren't there
[06/28/2005 02:06 PM] Dan F: so all thoes files are missing
[06/28/2005 02:06 PM] Me: you need to look at the code and the directory structure and make changes, maybe it is as simple as copying all of the #includes over to the project folder
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: yes they are missing completely
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: we are missing some sdk
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Dan F: for the emulator right?
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: the GCC tools for the Emulator i think
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: yes
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Dan F: ack
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: exactly
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Dan F: we'll have to look at it sometime
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: but we can figure it out
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: we can do this
[06/28/2005 02:07 PM] Me: i Pmed F34R
[06/28/2005 02:08 PM] Me: and asked for a little assistance
[06/28/2005 02:08 PM] Dan F: ok see what he says
[06/28/2005 02:08 PM] Me: off topic:  i researched the web browser for PSP
[06/28/2005 02:08 PM] Dan F: yeah its in a game right?
[06/28/2005 02:09 PM] Me: supposedly it is included in the update app on Wipeout Pure

[06/28/2005 02:09 PM] Me: all you do is use a DNS filter on your network and forward it to your own network server like Apache that i have set up
[06/28/2005 02:09 PM] Me: and with an index.htm in the right directory you have yourself a nice little browser
[06/28/2005 02:10 PM] Dan F: oh very nice
[06/28/2005 02:10 PM] Me: javascript supported might i add
[06/28/2005 02:10 PM] Me: and my DVDs are working!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[06/28/2005 02:11 PM] Me: yay my DVDs work!
[06/28/2005 02:11 PM] Me: now you have something to think about at work
[06/28/2005 02:12 PM] Me: getting those damn includes to work
[06/28/2005 02:12 PM] Dan F: yeah but i think we will need to use codewarrior as the compiler, i dout .net will work
[06/28/2005 02:12 PM] Me: no .NET uses the CodeWarrior compiler
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: so we can use the environment and the codewarrior plugin is in a toolbar
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Dan F: so we're good then?
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: we're very good
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Dan F: sick
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Dan F: ok NP then
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: we just need to figure out those includes
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Dan F: yeah
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: and we can compiler our first hello world
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: *compile
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Dan F: lol damn right
[06/28/2005 02:13 PM] Me: if we can get a submain and even a main() then we will be good
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Me: i am so excited
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Dan F: yeah thats why we will probably need to find an example program to run on the psp so we can figure out what functions we need to use
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Dan F: we just need a starting point
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Me: the functions we can find in the header files
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Me: and it comes with examples
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Dan F: yeah 
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Dan F: sample programs?
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Me: i think
[06/28/2005 02:15 PM] Me: maybe
[06/28/2005 02:16 PM] Dan F: lol very nice
[06/28/2005 02:16 PM] Me: it says installing examples
[06/28/2005 02:16 PM] Me: so it must be in there

[07/02/2005 02:15 PM] Dan F: that would be bad
[07/02/2005 02:16 PM] Me: yeah
[07/02/2005 02:20 PM] Me: damnit i hate work
[07/02/2005 02:23 PM] Dan F: ... ok stupid question you can increment a var in php with ++ right?
[07/02/2005 02:23 PM] Dan F: $num++
[07/02/2005 02:23 PM] Me: yes
[07/02/2005 02:23 PM] Dan F: ok just makin sure
[07/02/2005 02:24 PM] Dan F: wow i really need work
[07/02/2005 02:25 PM] Dan F: ...where does $_POST come from?
[07/02/2005 02:25 PM] Me: the page before it
[07/02/2005 02:25 PM] Dan F: phpmailer
[07/02/2005 02:25 PM] Me: hm?
[07/02/2005 02:26 PM] Me: oh
[07/02/2005 02:26 PM] Me: ....
[07/02/2005 02:26 PM] Me: its posting variables
[07/02/2005 02:28 PM] Dan F: ok and ur var committee were is that coming from
[07/02/2005 02:28 PM] Me: no wait
[07/02/2005 02:28 PM] Me: $_POST reads variables from a page previous to that
[07/02/2005 02:28 PM] Me: so $_POST reads the posted variables
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Dan F: lol ok so what was the page you had before this
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Me: the signup page
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Dan F: so its reading info from a form
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Me: with the form that is submitted
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Me: yes
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Dan F: ok now we're on the same page
[07/02/2005 02:29 PM] Me: the forms automatically posts the variables
[07/02/2005 02:30 PM] Dan F: ok i couldnt figure out where you getting this stuff from
[07/02/2005 02:30 PM] Me: but remember there are two sets of post variables
[07/02/2005 02:30 PM] Me: $_POST corresponds with $_GET
[07/02/2005 02:31 PM] Me: $http_get_vars corresponds with the variables set in the address
[07/02/2005 02:31 PM] Me: .php?some=variable
[07/02/2005 02:31 PM] Me: that stuff
[07/02/2005 02:31 PM] Dan F: ok so POST gets info thats transfered over to the next page
[07/02/2005 02:31 PM] Me: $HTTP_POST_VARS can only be used before a header
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Me: yes
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Dan F: so POST captures them
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Dan F: and GET sends them?
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Me: no that isn't right....
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/02/2005 02:32 PM] Me: now you have me confused
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Dan F: lol ive never used this post crap before
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: i don't know why i used $_POST there
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: i should have used $_GET
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Dan F: lmao
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: but i don't have time to test it now
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Dan F: yeah i'll get it working
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: it just works because it is getting all the variables previously posted
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: so i know it works
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Dan F: thanks tho now i have the insight i need
[07/02/2005 02:33 PM] Me: i would try get though
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Dan F: ok
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Me: because post is supposed to post variables and get is supposed to retrieve them
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Me: self explanatory
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Me: i should test that later
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Dan F: ok cool
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Dan F: thanks man
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Me: g2g to work
[07/02/2005 02:34 PM] Me: bye

[07/02/2005 11:59 PM] Me: and i am like "first of all i was asked by a manager to come in early, and second i am only scheduled 7 hours today which means i could have gone home at 10, but i decided to stay on FOR YOU." and hes like "alright fine get out of here"
[07/03/2005 12:00 AM] Me: and i'm like "that's right bitch whos your daddy?  cuz it aint Conrad tonight"

[07/03/2005 12:05 AM] Me: around 60
[07/03/2005 12:05 AM] Dan F: ehh ok 
[07/03/2005 12:05 AM] Me: it wasn't to bad
[07/03/2005 12:06 AM] Me: we could have used you though
[07/03/2005 12:06 AM] Me: kade and even made it worse
[07/03/2005 12:06 AM] Me: phuk them i am so glad i am leaving
[07/03/2005 12:06 AM] Dan F: yeah man
[07/03/2005 12:06 AM] Dan F: was kade expiditing tickets?
[07/03/2005 12:07 AM] Dan F: expediting*
[07/03/2005 12:08 AM] Me: what does that mean?
[07/03/2005 12:08 AM] Dan F: when the DS goes down to the corner and stops traffic and hands out tickets
[07/03/2005 12:08 AM] Dan F: cause he should have
[07/03/2005 12:09 AM] Me: no he did for a little bit
[07/03/2005 12:09 AM] Dan F: ok
[07/03/2005 12:09 AM] Me: he sucks
[07/03/2005 12:09 AM] Dan F: man the 4th is gunna blow even worse, casue Kade is the DS and they put me at the fuckin door
[07/03/2005 12:10 AM] Me: lol
[07/03/2005 12:10 AM] Me: yeah that sucks man
[07/03/2005 12:34 AM] Me: did you write that script?
[07/03/2005 12:35 AM] Dan F: not quite yet
[07/03/2005 12:35 AM] Me: don't use $_GET
[07/03/2005 12:35 AM] Dan F: i was kinda messing around with the newsletter
[07/03/2005 12:35 AM] Dan F: what exactly does that one do
[07/03/2005 12:35 AM] Me: use $_POST for everything because it is referring to what you previously posted
[07/03/2005 12:36 AM] Dan F: ok cool
[07/03/2005 12:36 AM] Me: dude i am just gonna have to show you this shit
[07/03/2005 12:36 AM] Me: its so confusing but you are probably gonna need it
[07/03/2005 12:36 AM] Dan F: aight
[07/03/2005 12:36 AM] Me: it all has to do with passing information between pages
[07/03/2005 12:37 AM] Me: like someone submits a form you have to pass that info along and put your submit script on the next page
[07/03/2005 12:37 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/03/2005 12:37 AM] Me: because with PHP you can't have an e-mail script on the same page that the user submits the info from
[07/03/2005 12:38 AM] Me: because it is server side compiling so it has to send the info back to the server first
[07/03/2005 12:38 AM] Me: hence the $_POST
[07/03/2005 12:38 AM] Me: then you extract that info by using the same $_POST on the next page
[07/03/2005 12:38 AM] Dan F: yeah its the same way when querying sql stuff
[07/03/2005 12:38 AM] Me: yeah exactly
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: so when i use $_GET in that spot we were talking about earlier
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: it shows up blank
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: all the variables are empty
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: so it is $_POST
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: and then we also have to go over the HTTP vars
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: but we will talk about that some other time
[07/03/2005 12:39 AM] Me: good shit dude
[07/03/2005 12:40 AM] Me: i love HTTP vars
[07/03/2005 12:40 AM] Dan F: as of right now i dont see any reason to use the http vars
[07/03/2005 12:40 AM] Me: and you will too once you start using them
[07/03/2005 12:40 AM] Me: what if you want your user to automatically confirm their e-mail address
[07/03/2005 12:40 AM] Me: all those long encoded links in confirmation pages are all HTTP vars
[07/03/2005 12:41 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/03/2005 12:44 AM] Me: dude i just learned virtual server for apache
[07/03/2005 12:44 AM] Me: phuk yeah
[07/03/2005 12:44 AM] Me: adding roots to all my sub sites
[07/03/2005 12:44 AM] Dan F: ohh very nice
[07/03/2005 12:45 AM] Me: because before every directory in my root acted like a directory
[07/03/2005 12:45 AM] Me: now since in PHP the root can be very important now it will work like a root
[07/03/2005 12:46 AM] Dan F: omg i just got this Enhancer for winamp
[07/03/2005 12:46 AM] Dan F: its very nice
[07/03/2005 12:47 AM] Me: nice
[07/03/2005 12:47 AM] Dan F: sounds great
[07/03/2005 12:47 AM] Me: the only problem is this might require me to have domains
[07/03/2005 12:47 AM] Dan F: hmm i dont see why
[07/03/2005 12:47 AM] Dan F: cause a domain is just a text version of an ip
[07/03/2005 12:48 AM] Dan F: basiclly
[07/03/2005 12:48 AM] Me: yeah
[07/03/2005 12:48 AM] Dan F: yeah i dout u'll need a domani
[07/03/2005 12:48 AM] Dan F: domain*
[07/03/2005 12:49 AM] Me: yeah but then how is it going to tell which root i want?
[07/03/2005 12:49 AM] Dan F: lmao yeah 
[07/03/2005 12:49 AM] Dan F: ok lets get some sleep and try tomarrow
[07/03/2005 12:49 AM] Me: ok peace
[07/03/2005 12:50 AM] Dan F: tty tomarrow

[07/07/2005 09:47 PM] Me: ...
[07/07/2005 09:47 PM] Me: 4. copy all the DLLs in pspdev_wo.zip's pspdev\bin folder to C:\Pspdev\bin 
 5. *NEW* copy make.exe in pspdev_wo.zip's pspdev\bin folder to C:\Pspdev\bin 
[07/07/2005 09:48 PM] Dan F: wtf why does it tell you to navigate to that other folder
[07/07/2005 09:48 PM] Me: are you reading the tutorial?
[07/07/2005 09:49 PM] Dan F: no brian
[07/07/2005 09:49 PM] Me: lol
[07/07/2005 09:51 PM] Dan F: ok after you go to C:\PSPDev\psp\sdk\samples\sdktest 
[07/07/2005 09:51 PM] Me: type make

[07/07/2005 09:53 PM] Dan F: which is where it says to go
[07/07/2005 09:53 PM] Me: no from the other file you download
[07/07/2005 09:53 PM] Me: from pspdev_wo.zip

[07/07/2005 10:08 PM] Me: i have no idea because it works here
[07/07/2005 10:08 PM] Me: but not on the PSP
[07/07/2005 10:09 PM] Me: i can only assume you followed the instructions completely
[07/07/2005 10:09 PM] Dan F: im going to start over
[07/07/2005 10:09 PM] Me: when you installed it you uninstalled it from Program Files and reinstalled it in C:\pspdev
[07/07/2005 10:09 PM] Me: but it doesn't matter because it still doesn't work on v1.52
[07/07/2005 10:10 PM] Dan F: seriously?
[07/07/2005 10:10 PM] Me: i loaded the eboot files to my psp and it said corrupt data
[07/07/2005 10:14 PM] Me: i figured out the problem with the DNS i forget to forward the WAN DNS to my computer
[07/07/2005 10:14 PM] Dan F: ohh 
[07/07/2005 10:14 PM] Dan F: ok lol
[07/07/2005 10:21 PM] Me: so?
[07/07/2005 10:21 PM] Me: working yet?
[07/07/2005 10:22 PM] Dan F: yeah i got it working, but all of this stuff wont work on 1.52
[07/07/2005 10:22 PM] Me: duh
[07/07/2005 10:22 PM] Me: that's what i was telling you
[07/07/2005 10:22 PM] Me: all sony does is make stuff proprietary
[07/07/2005 10:22 PM] Me: they are so fucking scared of losing profit that they don't let anyone change the products that they have to buy in the first place
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Dan F: yup 
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Dan F: it sux
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Me: why did i even buy this thing?
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Me: i kind of wish i didn't
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Dan F: to play games
[07/07/2005 10:23 PM] Me: for 50 dollars a pop
[07/07/2005 10:24 PM] Me: maybe if they didn't charge 100k for the phuking sdk there would be more developers in the world
[07/07/2005 10:24 PM] Me: more then 3 at UoA
[07/07/2005 10:24 PM] Dan F: heh
[07/07/2005 10:25 PM] Me: has tim got this working on the psp v1.52?
[07/07/2005 10:25 PM] Dan F: he has 1.5
[07/07/2005 10:30 PM] Me: # 
  
 agreeing with #6. 
 do you think that if you are able to obtain a work-around for 1.51+ that Sony will be unable to see our code, that they will be unable to decompile our librarys? They are the architects. I’m sure they have someone who sits at a desk all day and analyzes our exploits. 
  
 this battle will rage on, and regardless of whether we post our findings, or just release work-arounds, Sony will still be able to provide updates. 
  
 I am in favour of providing as much information to the Dev community as possible, so we can be on the ball and ready to handle anything Sony throws at us.

[07/07/2005 10:31 PM] Dan F: thoes bastards
[07/07/2005 10:35 PM] Me: do you have the 1.50 update?
[07/07/2005 10:35 PM] Me: saved somewhere?
[07/07/2005 10:35 PM] Me: i still have the 1.52
[07/07/2005 10:35 PM] Me: do you think you could revert back to an older one?
[07/07/2005 10:35 PM] Dan F: as far as i know its not possible without trading in ur psp for another one
[07/07/2005 10:36 PM] Dan F: which i dont care to do
[07/07/2005 10:41 PM] Me: how many incoming freshman at asu?
[07/07/2005 10:41 PM] *** Auto-response from Dan F: brb 8-)
[07/07/2005 10:46 PM] Me: # 
  
 What I don’t understand is why Sony has to be so proprietary in the first place. All they want to do is prevent creativity. Why don’t they phuking take a look at some of the better gaming companies our there. For example ID Software has links to a FULL engine SDK and manual complete sith forums and support. Is Sony so phuking scared of losing profit that they are willing to hinder the creative of the entire world. There are only 3 incoming freshman computer science major at the college my friend is going to. That is absolutely pathetic. Bill Gates even admits there is a lack of developers out there, well its because of companies like Sony that do nothing but keep secrets. Its sad really, I am starting to regret spending all this money on the PSP and a few games just to realize that it will never get any better. We can try all to change it all we want, but Sony is the proprietary monsters with all the secrets not us. Good luck to everyone, and i hope someday Sony will realize their stupidity and create something that is meant to be changed.

[07/07/2005 11:41 PM] Me: no that's for half life 1
[07/07/2005 11:42 PM] Dan F: oh phuk ur right
[07/07/2005 11:42 PM] Dan F: is it on the hl2 cd?
[07/07/2005 11:42 PM] Me: ...
[07/07/2005 11:42 PM] Me: i installed everything
[07/07/2005 11:43 PM] Me: shit you do use steam
[07/07/2005 11:43 PM] Me: i hope this is for HL2
[07/07/2005 11:45 PM] Dan F: it should say right?
[07/07/2005 11:46 PM] Me: their site says i have it
[07/07/2005 11:46 PM] Me: (Link: http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_Files_and_Directory_Structure)http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_File(Link: http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_Files_and_Directory_Structure)s_and_Directory_Structure
[07/07/2005 11:46 PM] Me: i have all that
[07/07/2005 11:47 PM] Me: and i have HAMMER
[07/07/2005 11:47 PM] Me: the map editor
[07/07/2005 11:47 PM] Me: awesome
[07/07/2005 11:47 PM] Dan F: ... you didnt know it was on ur phucking HDD!
[07/07/2005 11:48 PM] Me: lol
[07/07/2005 11:48 PM] Me: it comes with the game
[07/07/2005 11:48 PM] Dan F: i knew it!!
[07/07/2005 11:49 PM] Me: you have to pay for the source engine
[07/07/2005 11:50 PM] Dan F: where did u read that?
[07/07/2005 11:50 PM] Me: on their Wiki
[07/07/2005 11:51 PM] Me: it says competitive prices
[07/07/2005 11:52 PM] Me: so how do we get this SDK to work with .Net?
[07/07/2005 11:52 PM] Dan F: ... we dont have the engine
[07/07/2005 11:52 PM] Dan F: we need that 
[07/07/2005 11:52 PM] Me: but we have an SDK
[07/07/2005 11:53 PM] Me: so we can't use .Net to compile the source files?
[07/07/2005 11:53 PM] Dan F: why would u need to buy the source engine if we can just make it tho>
[07/07/2005 11:53 PM] Me: how do we make it?
[07/07/2005 11:54 PM] Dan F: i dont think we can
[07/07/2005 11:55 PM] Me: wow the wizard puts together an sln file
[07/07/2005 11:55 PM] Me: and the readme even says open it in visual studio
[07/07/2005 11:55 PM] Me: i think i will try that
[07/07/2005 11:58 PM] Me: lol this is going to be so awesome
[07/07/2005 11:58 PM] Me: they give you everything plus some
[07/07/2005 11:58 PM] Me: so much documentation to get through *sigh*
[07/07/2005 11:59 PM] Dan F: ok it seems to me that this source engine you have to lience, is like a "map editor" but it can make every aspect of the game 
[07/07/2005 11:59 PM] Dan F: with like no coding involved
[07/07/2005 11:59 PM] Me: yeah
[07/07/2005 11:59 PM] Me: they include a lot of tools
[07/07/2005 11:59 PM] Dan F: its a whole bunch of tools they put together to make this so my dad can create a mod
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Dan F: but everything your compiling is there 
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Dan F: which is everything we need
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Dan F: ur sure right?
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Me: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Me: i am working on my first mod
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Me: holy phuking god there is a lot of code here
[07/08/2005 12:00 AM] Me: omfg
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Me: everything is so long
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Me: *curls up in corner shaking*
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Me: how much of this do we have to mod?
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Dan F: probably none
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Me: yeah probably not
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Dan F: actually im sure none
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Dan F: thats all pre complied stuff that is ment to be used
[07/08/2005 12:01 AM] Me: the main part is going to be mapping and models
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Dan F: coding is the part i can do
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Me: no i am looking at the rocket code
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Me: for the RPG
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Me: the one with the laser sight
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Me: i have the cpp file opened now
[07/08/2005 12:02 AM] Dan F: how bad is it?
[07/08/2005 12:03 AM] Dan F: how many lines?
[07/08/2005 12:03 AM] Me: over 1,000
[07/08/2005 12:03 AM] Me: in one phuking weapong file
[07/08/2005 12:03 AM] Me: there is like 100 files in just this directory and a 100 more in the one above it
[07/08/2005 12:04 AM] Dan F: ok so its what openGL
[07/08/2005 12:04 AM] Dan F: or directX
[07/08/2005 12:05 AM] Me: ....
[07/08/2005 12:05 AM] Me: i don't know cpp
[07/08/2005 12:05 AM] Dan F: hl2 uses directX right
[07/08/2005 12:05 AM] Me: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:05 AM] Dan F: ok
[07/08/2005 12:06 AM] Me: but remember it takes full advantage of the HL2 engine
[07/08/2005 12:06 AM] Me: so you're not going to see DX
[07/08/2005 12:06 AM] Me: that's the engines job
[07/08/2005 12:06 AM] Dan F: but do we have the engine??
[07/08/2005 12:06 AM] Me: do you have the game?
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: it is going to relay all these variables and commands through the engine
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: the engine is what is compiled
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Dan F: and we have the source for that??
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: so the headers then use the unmanaged code
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: no
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: we don't have the source for the engine
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: that's what you have to buy
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: but we don't need it
[07/08/2005 12:07 AM] Me: its like using a dll file in your program
[07/08/2005 12:08 AM] Dan F: ok so we have everything needed to include the engine 
[07/08/2005 12:08 AM] Me: or a better example a compiled program can still be taken advantage of through header files right?
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Dan F: as long as you dont need to modify the functions
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: say you make a program like a menu bar, you make a menu look real fancy, then you compile it, then you include that dll in all your other programs
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: you can still pass things through the engine like what menu items to display right?
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: but its compiled
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: so you use the header file to link them together
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: we have the HL2 header files
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Dan F: ok ok
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: everything is all right hear
[07/08/2005 12:09 AM] Me: *here
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Dan F: so what you can buy is the source for the actual engine, if you want to modify that
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Me: that's the same way an engine works, Valve and ID made their engines to be modded they did it on purpose
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Me: yes
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Dan F: aight
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Me: that's what you have to purchase
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Me: and ID sells their engine too
[07/08/2005 12:10 AM] Me: Sierra bought the Quake 2 engine and modded it
[07/08/2005 12:11 AM] Me: ... its still compiling
[07/08/2005 12:11 AM] Dan F: any problems yet?
[07/08/2005 12:11 AM] Me: nope
[07/08/2005 12:12 AM] Me: but .Net is gay it doesn't list the tasks until its done
[07/08/2005 12:12 AM] Dan F: thats kinda scary...
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: because it reverts all its energy to the compiler and output display it doesn't want to have to redraw a list of 10^10x10000000000000000 errors all the time
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Dan F: lol
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: omg its linking
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Dan F: very good
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: which means there aren't any errors
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: linking is after errors
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: omfg i love this
[07/08/2005 12:13 AM] Me: you're going to have a lot of catching up to do tomorrow
[07/08/2005 12:14 AM] Dan F: yeah i dont even have hl installed on this machine
[07/08/2005 12:14 AM] Me: tomorrow i will be downloading the (Link: http://www.softimage.com/products/Mod/v4/)http://www.softimage.com/products/Mod/v4/
[07/08/2005 12:15 AM] Me: omfg i have to pirate this shit
[07/08/2005 12:15 AM] Me: damnit
[07/08/2005 12:15 AM] Me: maybe 3ds max will be able to export to half life 2
[07/08/2005 12:16 AM] Me: it completed
[07/08/2005 12:16 AM] Dan F: ur gunna need a plug-in
[07/08/2005 12:17 AM] Dan F: ok so now is there like a shell program we can build off of?
[07/08/2005 12:17 AM] Dan F: cause its gunna be hard to figure out where to start
[07/08/2005 12:17 AM] Me: they give you that after you buy
[07/08/2005 12:17 AM] Me: they have a plugin for valve source
[07/08/2005 12:18 AM] Me: we jump right into it
[07/08/2005 12:18 AM] Dan F: ok so do we have a starting point?
[07/08/2005 12:18 AM] Dan F: or need to buy one
[07/08/2005 12:19 AM] Me: no we have a starting point
[07/08/2005 12:19 AM] Me: that's the sdk
[07/08/2005 12:19 AM] Me: now we just tear it apart and start changing shit
[07/08/2005 12:19 AM] Me: the AI for all the extra stuff we add is going to be the hardest
[07/08/2005 12:19 AM] Me: we asign tasks to the team
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Dan F: ok ur missing what an sdk does, its not ment to be taken apart, its ment to be used in conjunction with what you create
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: we start on mapping, experimenting, and rewriting code
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: yes i know
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: the wizard creates your own copy of everything you need to start
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: its amazing
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: i just compiled with 0 problems
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Dan F: thank you thats what i wanted to hear
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: sorry
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Dan F: so we have a shell
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Me: yes
[07/08/2005 12:20 AM] Dan F: an outline
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Me: the wizard gave is that
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Dan F: that complies
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Me: yes
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Me: i am running it right now
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Dan F: thats what i was trying to get you to say lmao
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Me: sorry
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Dan F: lol
[07/08/2005 12:21 AM] Dan F: its all good
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: yes we are more then good
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: we have begun
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i need a map
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Dan F: ok cool deal
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i hate mapping
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: takes so fucking long
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i wish we could use radiant for this shit
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: its so awesome
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: maybe their hl1 compiler will work in HL2
[07/08/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i doubt it but maybe
[07/08/2005 12:23 AM] Dan F: i reeeaaalllyyy dout that
[07/08/2005 12:23 AM] Me: phuk
[07/08/2005 12:23 AM] Me: i really want to use radiant
[07/08/2005 12:23 AM] Dan F: do we have a mapping program, or do we need to use 3ds to make everything
[07/08/2005 12:23 AM] Me: we have HAMMER
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Me: looks like its going to suck
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Dan F: which sux?
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Me: we could use world craft
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Dan F: but radiant doesnt have hl2 support yet?
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Me: no
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Me: ... they move slow
[07/08/2005 12:24 AM] Dan F: that blows
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Me: actually i think world craft was renamed to HAMMER
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Me: and valve specific now
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Me: it used to support other games
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Dan F: ok then
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Me: i will look at HAMMER more later
[07/08/2005 12:25 AM] Dan F: ok yeah im really tired
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Me: but Radiant is more like 3ds max then HAMMER is
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Me: i mean it does everything
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Me: me too
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Me: i am going to bed
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Dan F: i'll get all that stuff working tomarrow before work
[07/08/2005 12:26 AM] Dan F: ok me too
[07/08/2005 12:41 AM] Me: omg i love this game
[07/08/2005 12:41 AM] Dan F: what the one u just made?
[07/08/2005 12:42 AM] Me: no all i changed was the rocked speed it was in the tutorial
[07/08/2005 12:42 AM] Me: i mean half life 2
[07/08/2005 12:42 AM] Me: its awesome
[07/08/2005 12:42 AM] Dan F: yeah lol
[07/08/2005 12:42 AM] Me: you know i think we are really on to something
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Dan F: lol lets hope so
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: but seriously
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: if this works
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: we could distribute it
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: we could actually get a release into stores
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: just like counter strike
[07/08/2005 12:43 AM] Me: but it will be Half Life 2: War of The Worlds
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Me: after that
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Dan F: i dont feel right releasing stuff we had to pirate to build 
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Me: we haven't pirated anything yet
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Me: the modeling might be the only thing
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Dan F: but we'll have to 
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Dan F: yeah
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Dan F: for modeling its impossible on simple apps
[07/08/2005 12:44 AM] Me: but then we could buy the engine and come out with a standalone
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Dan F: lets get somthing working first 
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Me: omfg that would be so awesome
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Dan F: before we get ahead of ourselves
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Me: Eric did it, he modded GTA
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Dan F: nice lol
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Me: well i know we have all the resources we need
[07/08/2005 12:45 AM] Me: except for modeling
[07/08/2005 12:46 AM] Dan F: good deal
[07/08/2005 12:46 AM] Me: and i have already compiled a working mod
[07/08/2005 12:46 AM] Me: now for every little change like mapping and modeling we won't have to compile the cpp stuff
[07/08/2005 12:46 AM] Me: that is loaded externaling
[07/08/2005 12:47 AM] Me: that is loaded externaly
[07/08/2005 12:47 AM] Me: the map is loaded by command line and the models are loaded by the map
[07/08/2005 12:47 AM] Me: ok i am going to bed
[07/08/2005 12:47 AM] Me: we will talk later

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Dan F): Fri Jul 08 12:48:42 2005
[07/08/2005 12:48 PM] Me: we get a free distribution of XSI
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: a good version?
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: that can export models?
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Me: it'll do
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: very nice
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: yeah im dling the sdk now
[07/08/2005 12:49 PM] Me: its so nice
[07/08/2005 12:50 PM] Me: i found a better mapping software
[07/08/2005 12:50 PM] Dan F: sick
[07/08/2005 12:50 PM] Me: called QuarK
[07/08/2005 12:50 PM] Me: it compiles for HL2 but its pretty recent so its going to be a chore to get it to work
[07/08/2005 12:51 PM] Me: i think i have it set up the right way
[07/08/2005 12:51 PM] Me: so i figured out what everyone should work on
[07/08/2005 12:51 PM] Me: Eric will join the team
[07/08/2005 12:53 PM] Dan F: ok whats everyone going to do
[07/08/2005 12:53 PM] Me: You - Programming
 Greg - Texture design
 Eric - Modeling
 Chase & Me - Mapping
[07/08/2005 12:54 PM] Dan F: we can do that
[07/08/2005 12:54 PM] Me: but programming is going to be the hardest
[07/08/2005 12:54 PM] Me: so i will have to be there for that too
[07/08/2005 12:54 PM] Dan F: ok
[07/08/2005 12:55 PM] Me: and greg is a lazy fuck, so who knows how much he will do
[07/08/2005 12:55 PM] Me: we need to have a meeting ASAP to draw everything out
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: your hardest but most important task will be working on the AI
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Dan F: .. btw what are we going to make anyways
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: i think we should make a War Of The Worlds mod
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: there isn't even a game out yet
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: they have an online game that's very corney
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: i mean its perfect
[07/08/2005 12:56 PM] Me: everyone will play it
[07/08/2005 12:57 PM] Me: if we do it right it will be awesome
[07/08/2005 12:57 PM] Me: it won't be a total conversion mod
[07/08/2005 12:57 PM] Me: so we will still use a lot of the stuff from HL2
[07/08/2005 12:58 PM] Me: but game play will be a lot different
[07/08/2005 01:03 PM] Me: holy shit this modeling software looks tight
[07/08/2005 01:05 PM] Dan F: ok but war of the worlds is copyrighted and everything we cant just take it and make a game
[07/08/2005 01:05 PM] Dan F: it needs to be somthing origial
[07/08/2005 01:05 PM] Me: .... yeah
[07/08/2005 01:06 PM] Me: but
[07/08/2005 01:06 PM] Me: its a book
[07/08/2005 01:06 PM] Dan F: written works are still protected
[07/08/2005 01:08 PM] Dan F: ack i'll bbl
[07/08/2005 01:23 PM] Me: omfg there is so much here
[07/08/2005 01:23 PM] *** Auto-response from Dan F: I am away from my computer right now.

[07/11/2005 02:23 PM] Dan F: its great
[07/11/2005 02:23 PM] Me: yeah but there is so fucking much of it
[07/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: every file is like 500 lines
[07/11/2005 02:24 PM] Dan F: 500 lines is like nothing dude
[07/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: besides when we MAKE OUR OWN weapons we have to use that as a model then completely rewrite it
[07/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: no it isn't but where there is 200 files its a lot of code
[07/11/2005 02:25 PM] Me: i was using 2003 when i opened the sdk
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: project file
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: did you get it to work?
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Dan F: no 
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: oh
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: why don't i just give you 2003
[07/11/2005 02:26 PM] Dan F: that would be awesome
[07/11/2005 02:32 PM] Me: yeah i guess this isn't that bad
[07/11/2005 02:32 PM] Me: i'll give you 2003 tomorrow
[07/11/2005 02:32 PM] Me: then we will share ideas
[07/11/2005 02:32 PM] Dan F: sounds good
[07/11/2005 02:32 PM] Me: then we will setup everything we need to begin work
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: and of course we can't forget naming!
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: we should make a list of all the topics we need to go over
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: i think i will do that now
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: Eric is out
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: hes to fucking lazy
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Dan F: YES! i wasnt to crazy about having him onboard
[07/11/2005 02:33 PM] Me: he won't make any contribution anyways we will just end up waiting on him
[07/11/2005 02:34 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/11/2005 02:34 PM] Me: hes one of my best friends but this just isn't his thing
[07/11/2005 02:34 PM] Dan F: thats understandable
[07/11/2005 02:35 PM] Me: so we need another team mate
[07/11/2005 02:35 PM] Me: i can't be responsible for mapping and modeling
[07/11/2005 02:35 PM] Me: i am going to have to learn a completely new mapping software, i have enough on my plate
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: ok then what are you going to do
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: ok
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Me: Greg can't be responsible for texturing and modeling
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Me: texturing is a very tedious task
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: yeah we are all gunna have to learn
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: so is modeling
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: and programming
[07/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan F: its all hard dude
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan F: me and greg are 10000000% on and willing to do this
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Me: so i figured if we just all did one area then we would be good, but without a 4th team mate who is going to do modeling?
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan F: me
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan F: i like modeling/amimation
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan F: and i know how
[07/11/2005 02:37 PM] Me: woah modeling/animation/ and programming?
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Me: that's a lot of your plate
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Me: *on
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Dan F: im willing
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Me: the animation is separate from programming
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Dan F: but the two work together
[07/11/2005 02:38 PM] Me: alright we will see how it goes
[07/11/2005 02:39 PM] Dan F: programming is gunna be connected to every aspect of this
[07/11/2005 02:39 PM] Dan F: and it wont be as tedious as the other stuff
[07/11/2005 02:39 PM] Me: the programming isn't so much connected to mapping, mapping is kind of on its own
[07/11/2005 02:40 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/11/2005 02:40 PM] Dan F: but animation and models are 
[07/11/2005 02:40 PM] Me: yeah
[07/11/2005 02:40 PM] Me: and they are connected to mapping
[07/11/2005 02:44 PM] Me: i could probably tell you how to get it started in 2002
[07/11/2005 02:44 PM] Me: did you change the version?
[07/11/2005 02:44 PM] Dan F: no i didnt update yet
[07/11/2005 02:45 PM] Me: yeah 2002 is version 7
[07/11/2005 02:45 PM] Me: the solution file is version 8
[07/11/2005 02:45 PM] Dan F: ok so how can i get the solutions to work in 7
[07/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: lol
[07/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: i just tried
[07/11/2005 02:46 PM] Dan F: and you cant
[07/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: hold on

[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Dan F: you'll have to pass it on to me so i can add entities and code
[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Dan F: lol wow
[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Me: i have entities working
[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Dan F: even better
[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Me: you just have to give me new definitions
[07/14/2005 01:09 PM] Me: those three things i listed were already scripted entities
[07/14/2005 01:10 PM] Me: its easy to insert those but if we make our own you have to give me the definitions and things that can  be passed through it
[07/14/2005 01:10 PM] Me: then i will deal with them
[07/14/2005 01:10 PM] Dan F: ok so have you loaded that map into the mod to test it
[07/14/2005 01:10 PM] Me: yes

[07/14/2005 01:33 PM] Dan F: ?
[07/14/2005 01:34 PM] Me: i am not going to make a usual elevator with thick heavy cords
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Me: it is going to have a lift on it
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Dan F: sure
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Me: a big steal lift pushing it upwards
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Me: but since it is on a slant on the side of a crater it has the change direction
[07/14/2005 01:35 PM] Me: so then another lift is going to control the next direction
[07/14/2005 01:36 PM] Dan F: yeah i getcha
[07/14/2005 01:56 PM] Dan F: whatrs ur house num?

[07/15/2005 11:33 AM] Me: i was just getting ready to work on it today
[07/15/2005 11:33 AM] Me: but there are some problems with the design
[07/15/2005 11:33 AM] Me: its not detailed enough
[07/15/2005 11:33 AM] Me: there are no rocky cliffs and the dome has to be really big, which i can't display
[07/15/2005 11:34 AM] Dan F: the dome will probably have to be a skybox 
[07/15/2005 11:34 AM] Me: that's a good idea but there is a problem with that too
[07/15/2005 11:35 AM] Dan F: ok but can you take what you have and slim it down for me a bit
[07/15/2005 11:35 AM] Dan F: i want a basic map to show in our main menu
[07/15/2005 11:35 AM] Me: this level is on the edge where an airport would be

[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Dan F: i want to test somthing and that hammer program blows a fat one
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Me: for now just specify one of theirs that is already made
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Dan F: didnt you say u had a map done
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Me: can't you just use one of theirs
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Dan F: fine
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Me: if you can use one of ours you can definitely use one of theirs just change the path name later
[07/15/2005 11:36 AM] Me: it all loads up with the files lists the right way
[07/15/2005 11:37 AM] Me: so i know it will work
[07/15/2005 11:37 AM] Dan F: ...wtf are all their maps?

[07/15/2005 11:38 AM] Dan F: ok keep it simple for now
[07/15/2005 11:38 AM] Me: it is simple
[07/15/2005 11:38 AM] Me: too simple
[07/15/2005 11:38 AM] Me: its time i started adding detail
[07/15/2005 11:39 AM] Me: like railing and a security check and glass elevator siding
[07/15/2005 11:39 AM] Me: and omfg rocks
[07/15/2005 11:39 AM] Me: where am i going to get all the rocks
[07/15/2005 11:39 AM] Dan F: lol

[07/15/2005 12:53 PM] Me: then does the exact opposite thing on the way back up
[07/15/2005 12:53 PM] Dan F: thats all animation

[07/15/2005 01:33 PM] Dan F: sick
[07/15/2005 01:38 PM] Me: because half life 2 is so awesome there is this thing called 3D skybox
[07/15/2005 01:38 PM] Me: which is basically the same thing as your map except everything is 1/16 the size
[07/15/2005 01:38 PM] Me: and the quality is automatically adjusted for performance
[07/15/2005 01:38 PM] Dan F: sick
[07/15/2005 01:39 PM] Dan F: so can we make a dome from the skybox now?
[07/15/2005 01:39 PM] Me: so i could make the entire crater in the 3D skybox and it would look alright
[07/15/2005 01:39 PM] Me: yes

[07/17/2005 04:34 PM] Me: i can't even use the 3d skybox now, i have to completely rebuild it and it still doesn't solve the problem of how i will get something that large in the map
[07/17/2005 04:35 PM] Dan F: hmm
[07/17/2005 04:35 PM] Dan F: ok but how does it look?

[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Dan F: actually now 
[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: to bad the menu doesn't make a good game
[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: but its an important start
[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Dan F: first impressions tho
[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: would you like be to make you a background map?
[07/17/2005 05:15 PM] Dan F: i have extreamly high expectiotions from everyone
[07/17/2005 05:16 PM] Dan F: let me try i have this awesome picture in my head i wanna make then we'll get a general conseses

[07/17/2005 05:30 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/17/2005 05:30 PM] Me: we are gonna have a big problem with terrain
[07/17/2005 05:30 PM] Dan F: send me the screen shit
[07/17/2005 05:30 PM] Dan F: shot* lmfao
[07/17/2005 05:32 PM] *** BrianJCullinan wants to directly connect.

[07/17/2005 05:34 PM] Me: 
[07/17/2005 05:35 PM] Me: there is more
[07/17/2005 05:35 PM] Me: like the inside has escalators that actually move and there is an elevator that will need adjustments on the path that it moves once we figure out the terrain
[07/17/2005 05:35 PM] *** Dan F direct connection is closed (couldn't send packet!).
[07/17/2005 05:35 PM] Me: and of course that picture isn't showing the skybox
[07/17/2005 05:36 PM] Dan F: the blue parts all glass?

[07/17/2005 05:37 PM] Me: those are see through

[07/17/2005 05:45 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: anywho look at the other mods
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: they are incredibl
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: e
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Dan F: NoLiIVIiT F0rcE: what mapping program do u use?
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: wtf?
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: QuArK
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Dan F: thats what i wanted to know
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Me: 4 beta 3
[07/17/2005 05:46 PM] Dan F: and it can import .3ds files
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: it does what entities allow it to do
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Dan F: and output into the halflife format?
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: no
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: maps contain entities
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: the basic ones are things like brushes
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: different sided even
[07/17/2005 05:47 PM] Me: it outputs the entity name and properties when it compiles
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Dan F: ok so if i want to make a new menu map that contains some entities, can i make the models in 3ds?
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Me: then the engine or sdk decide what each entity does in the game
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Dan F: ah ok
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Me: that's what i am going to work on
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Me: i don't know how to convert 3ds to valve proprietary yet
[07/17/2005 05:48 PM] Dan F: can 3ds go into QuArk?
[07/17/2005 05:49 PM] Me: yes in QuArK you can change the properties of an entity
[07/17/2005 05:50 PM] Me: of course you won't be able to see what it really looks like because quark does not have the engine built into it
[07/17/2005 05:50 PM] Me: so it can't ready the 3ds file

[07/17/2005 05:58 PM] Me: yeah
[07/17/2005 05:58 PM] Dan F: fuck yeah go Brian
[07/17/2005 05:58 PM] Me: i thought it had to be an SMD file for models
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Dan F: yeah theres a script that converts 3ds to smd
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: i have that
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: but then you need a texture file
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Me: and a qc file?
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Dan F: yeah it makes it
[07/17/2005 05:59 PM] Dan F: that script can do all that
[07/17/2005 06:01 PM] Me: so where do i put this script file?
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Dan F: anywhere, then you can tell 3ds to use it when ur ready
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: and it makes the smd file?
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: because i found this other plugin that puts it in the export file list
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Dan F: doesnt matter to me
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: and you can export it as a smd file
[07/17/2005 06:02 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: well make me a model
[07/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: and i will put it in the map
[07/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: then send you the map
[07/17/2005 06:03 PM] Me: and you can use that for your background
[07/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: because i really don't feel like helping you get QuArK setup, it was a pain in the ass
[07/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: it would just be easier if i show you tomorrow
[07/17/2005 06:04 PM] Dan F: fuck it, 3ds blows it away
[07/17/2005 06:04 PM] Dan F: dude all i need is max and im good to go
[07/17/2005 06:04 PM] Me: you can't make maps with 3ds
[07/17/2005 06:05 PM] Dan F: making maps is ur job lol, all im concerned about is models
[07/17/2005 06:05 PM] Me: sry you sounded like you were going to make a map for your model
[07/17/2005 06:05 PM] Me: but if you send me the model i'll put it in a map for you
[07/17/2005 06:05 PM] Dan F: ok you want all the hl2 compat. stuff right
[07/17/2005 06:05 PM] Me: but i need to know how to use 3ds too so i can make filler objects
[07/17/2005 06:06 PM] Dan F: yeah let me make sure i can get this stuff to work and i'll get back to ya
[07/17/2005 06:06 PM] Me: ok
[07/17/2005 06:06 PM] Me: tomorrow we will get me set up
[07/17/2005 06:06 PM] Dan F: and me with QuArk and all that crap, you and i should always be on the same page
[07/17/2005 06:07 PM] Me: yeah
[07/17/2005 06:07 PM] Me: now what are we gonna do about greg
[07/17/2005 06:07 PM] Me: i need textures bad
[07/17/2005 06:08 PM] Dan F: lmao
[07/17/2005 06:08 PM] Me: but he doesn't seen to be working to hard on them
[07/17/2005 06:08 PM] Dan F: well we havent told him what to make yet
[07/17/2005 06:08 PM] Dan F: and he'll need a bit of teaching
[07/17/2005 06:09 PM] Dan F: so all ur textures are just .bmp or somthing right
[07/17/2005 06:09 PM] Dan F: casue i can take all thoes sick texture i have in max and just render them in high quality
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Me: i saved them as bmp then convert them to tga
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Me: don't ask me where i got the converter i don't know, it just shows up in my right click menu
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Dan F: ok what textures do you want, i can get them to ya with the model i'll make
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Dan F: lmfao
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Dan F: nice
[07/17/2005 06:10 PM] Me: then i run them through the vtex.exe prog

[07/17/2005 07:28 PM] Dan F: ... ok i got somwhere but 
[07/17/2005 07:28 PM] Dan F: the .mld has no texture
[07/17/2005 07:28 PM] Dan F: does that get imported later?
[07/17/2005 07:28 PM] Me: we have a big f-ing problem
[07/17/2005 07:29 PM] Dan F: ok u first
[07/17/2005 07:29 PM] Me: no the texture should be integrated with the smd file
[07/17/2005 07:29 PM] Me: i have this awesome terrain generator that loads in the game
[07/17/2005 07:29 PM] Me: but only through hammer
[07/17/2005 07:29 PM] Me: i don't like that fucking program
[07/17/2005 07:31 PM] Me: i don't know what to do
[07/17/2005 07:31 PM] Me: qaurk won't support planes
[07/17/2005 07:31 PM] Me: for half life 2
[07/17/2005 07:32 PM] Me: and this hammer program seems to do it
[07/17/2005 07:33 PM] Me: i don't know what to do
[07/17/2005 07:33 PM] Dan F: im confused on now to compile the model
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Me: i have no idea
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Me: you will have to read tutorials for that
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Dan F: i am lol
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Dan F: wtf
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Me: i have been searching how to get the terrain program to work in quark but no luck
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Me: wtf?
[07/17/2005 07:34 PM] Dan F: thats gay
[07/17/2005 07:35 PM] Me: what?
[07/17/2005 07:35 PM] Dan F: the terrain thing
[07/17/2005 07:35 PM] Me: yeah
[07/17/2005 07:35 PM] Me: quark is a bitch
[07/17/2005 07:35 PM] Me: our options are this, use hammer, which is a bigger bitch, or wait for quark to come out with a new version
[07/17/2005 07:37 PM] Me: or we make everything except the terrain in quark now and spend 4 months working on it and hope that the next version will support the terrain so we don't have to restart and do everything in hammer
[07/17/2005 07:37 PM] Dan F: lets get somthing working for now man
[07/17/2005 07:37 PM] Dan F: somthing basic
[07/17/2005 07:37 PM] Dan F: the map you had will work great
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: i have that
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: but it looks like shit without terrain
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: and if we don't have terrain then we can't have a game
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: so we have to figure something out
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: same thing with models
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Me: just keep plugging away at it
[07/17/2005 07:38 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/17/2005 07:39 PM] Me: but this is getting to be a bitch
[07/17/2005 07:39 PM] Dan F: these are just obsticules
[07/17/2005 07:40 PM] Dan F: lol

[07/17/2005 07:56 PM] Me: you think it is powerful?
[07/17/2005 07:56 PM] Dan F: now that im looking at it, stuff can be done with it, its not easy
[07/17/2005 07:56 PM] Dan F: but i can be done
[07/17/2005 07:56 PM] Me: yeah....

[07/17/2005 10:57 PM] Me: it would be so great if he could compile the damn textures and move them around in folders
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: but you know there are just about a bagilion textures already made out there
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: we could just copy
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Dan F: ok so jeremy can keep a running texture library 
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: yeah
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: at least he would be there to organize texture sets
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Dan F: but he can keep track of them and do any tweaking
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: figure out which ones we need
[07/17/2005 10:58 PM] Me: exactly
[07/17/2005 10:59 PM] Dan F: yeah and not all textures are gunna map perfectly so he can edit them as fit
[07/17/2005 10:59 PM] Dan F: see what his schedual is tomarrow?
[07/17/2005 10:59 PM] Dan F: ... no question mark tho
[07/17/2005 11:01 PM] Me: why no ???

[07/17/2005 11:24 PM] Me: acrylic feet lights
[07/17/2005 11:25 PM] Dan F: yeahi like that idea a lot
[07/17/2005 11:25 PM] Me: $200 for fans powersupply and acrylic cleaner and shipping should i order?
[07/17/2005 11:26 PM] Dan F: ur budget is 1000?
[07/17/2005 11:26 PM] Me: yup
[07/17/2005 11:26 PM] Me: for everything except my chip and videoboard
[07/17/2005 11:27 PM] Me: i mean that takes care of case fans and power
[07/17/2005 11:27 PM] Me: which would probably be somewhere around 80 for a plain case and factory power supply at frys
[07/17/2005 11:29 PM] Me: but the great thing about it is the fact that all of the cables are detachable. Instead of having to take your newly installed PSU and rack your brain over how to hide the rats nest of wires and unused connectors, you can just leave them in the box with the X-Connect
[07/17/2005 11:30 PM] Dan F: thats nice
[07/17/2005 11:31 PM] Me: but i only need about 400w of power
[07/17/2005 11:34 PM] Me: do you think i should buy it?
[07/17/2005 11:34 PM] Dan F: yeah man sounds like a good deal
[07/17/2005 11:34 PM] Dan F: thats some really nice stuff
[07/17/2005 11:40 PM] Me: i don't know about this power supply
[07/17/2005 11:46 PM] Me: hmmm

[07/17/2005 11:52 PM] Dan F: see how much the other stuff is gunna be
[07/17/2005 11:52 PM] Dan F: thats more importnat
[07/17/2005 11:52 PM] Me: supposedly the 400gb seagate 7200.8 is the 3rd slowest hard drive
[07/17/2005 11:53 PM] Dan F: that they make?
[07/17/2005 11:53 PM] Me: yeah
[07/17/2005 11:53 PM] Dan F: its still 7200rpms
[07/17/2005 11:53 PM] Me: yeah but its slow
[07/17/2005 11:54 PM] Me: the average seek time is really slow
[07/17/2005 11:54 PM] Me: like 15ms
[07/17/2005 11:54 PM] Dan F: ack yeah thats slow
[07/17/2005 11:54 PM] Me: instead of 10 that is should be
[07/17/2005 11:54 PM] Me: listed at 8 but because if normal disk latency it should be around 10 or 11
[07/17/2005 11:55 PM] Dan F: ok

[07/18/2005 12:00 AM] Dan F: thats cool
[07/18/2005 12:01 AM] Me: i have a question
[07/18/2005 12:01 AM] Dan F: ?
[07/18/2005 12:02 AM] Me: if the board only supports up to ddr400 but you get something faster would it still improve performance or even be usuable?
[07/18/2005 12:02 AM] Dan F: i dont think so, its only as fast as the board can fill up the ram
[07/18/2005 12:03 AM] Me: but would it be usable
[07/18/2005 12:03 AM] Dan F: no
[07/18/2005 12:03 AM] Me: because this site has this thing that picks out what memory is compatible with my board and some ddr500 are showing up
[07/18/2005 12:04 AM] Dan F: if that'll work do it
[07/18/2005 12:05 AM] Me: but the site says ddr400
[07/18/2005 12:06 AM] Dan F: hmmm
[07/18/2005 12:24 AM] Me: well i am off to bed

[07/20/2005 11:01 AM] Me: and then when you go through it the fog changes
[07/20/2005 11:01 AM] Dan F: changes to what?
[07/20/2005 11:01 AM] Me: still working on it
[07/20/2005 11:01 AM] Me: right now i have it as on and off completely
[07/20/2005 11:02 AM] Me: but i am going to change it so that when you are inside the domes it just changes the distance to a lot bigger
[07/20/2005 11:03 AM] Dan F: so no fog inside the dome right?

[07/20/2005 11:09 AM] Me: ah i remember
[07/20/2005 11:09 AM] Me: remember how we couldn't get it to be a really long train ride because it said object out of bounds and caused a leak
[07/20/2005 11:09 AM] Me: well....
[07/20/2005 11:10 AM] Me: that was only in one direction
[07/20/2005 11:10 AM] Dan F: so we can curve this thing all over the entire map
[07/20/2005 11:10 AM] Me: so not we have a nice 30 second train ride and a 3 minute walk

[07/23/2005 11:10 AM] Me: since we are going to do that rotating ground in the train to make it seem like a long ride, should i put hurt in the middle so the player can't walk through the shields to the main trainstation?
[07/23/2005 11:11 AM] Dan F: you need to do somthing yeah
[07/23/2005 11:11 AM] Dan F: that would be good
[07/23/2005 11:12 AM] Me: ok and it will display a message, "The atmosphere is too thin here you must go back!"

[07/24/2005 12:39 PM] Dan F: yeah ok
[07/24/2005 12:39 PM] Me: but i phuked up the code pretty bad
[07/24/2005 12:39 PM] Me: i wasn't planning on going anywhere with it because i went down the wrong path
[07/24/2005 12:40 PM] Me: we need to kind of copy or model ours off of the hud_suit instead of hud_health
[07/24/2005 12:40 PM] Dan F: will the o2 panel work or is it jsut text?
[07/24/2005 12:40 PM] Me: it has a number
[07/24/2005 12:40 PM] Me: that shows up when you get the suit
[07/24/2005 12:40 PM] Me: and i can put it anywhere on the screen
[07/24/2005 12:41 PM] Dan F: yeah thas easy stuff
[07/24/2005 12:41 PM] Me: and i found the spot where you reset all of the values when you respawn
[07/24/2005 12:41 PM] Me: and we will have to add it to a save game value
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Dan F: sure
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Me: and.... it looks good
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Me: i am starting to understand it
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Me: but it was way too brain numbing at the time
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Me: so we will work on the when you come over tomorrow
[07/24/2005 12:42 PM] Me: or tuesday
[07/24/2005 12:43 PM] Dan F: did you just add the o2 panel into the resource file?
[07/24/2005 12:43 PM] Me: no more
[07/24/2005 12:44 PM] Me: i added code
[07/24/2005 12:44 PM] Dan F: ok 
[07/24/2005 12:44 PM] Me: you have to create the hud item with code then use the resource file to get it to display
[07/24/2005 12:44 PM] Me: pretty much somewhere under the hl2 folder is hud_*
[07/24/2005 12:45 PM] Me: battery, health, ammo, suit, flashlight, sprint
[07/24/2005 12:45 PM] Me: all of those things
[07/24/2005 12:45 PM] Dan F: yeah its the same way with adding a panel to main menu
[07/24/2005 12:45 PM] Me: so we just have to model ours off of one or those
[07/24/2005 12:46 PM] Dan F: i wanna add other stuff to the hud also
[07/24/2005 12:46 PM] Me: but i haven't actually found the connection between displaying health with m_iHealth, and setting the health with SetHealth()
[07/24/2005 12:46 PM] Me: i mean i know where both of those are, i just can't figure out where they are used
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Me: because we need to add a trigger_hurtoxygen
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Me: so i can control the levels and speed of depletion for the oxygen
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Dan F: ok lets take a loog
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Dan F: look*
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Me: and i found trigger_hurt it is all in one triggers.cpp file which is annoying
[07/24/2005 12:47 PM] Dan F: the hud stuff is under hl2 or client?
[07/24/2005 12:48 PM] Me: i think it is under hl2
[07/24/2005 12:49 PM] Me: no it is under client
[07/24/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/24/2005 12:49 PM] Me: client/HL2/hud_health.cpp
[07/24/2005 12:49 PM] Me: so that is where we create out hud object
[07/24/2005 12:49 PM] Dan F: so everything is dirived from the base panel class
[07/24/2005 12:50 PM] Me: yes
[07/24/2005 12:50 PM] Me: line 69 is where it adds it to a group of objects to be hidden
[07/24/2005 12:51 PM] Me: so certain groups of items can be displayed and hidden at the same time
[07/24/2005 12:51 PM] Dan F: real quick where did you call ur panels create function to make it show
[07/24/2005 12:52 PM] Me: lol i had such a hard time with that
[07/24/2005 12:53 PM] Dan F: yeah its hard
[07/24/2005 12:53 PM] Me: when it is declared some other code like hud_help<something> creates it automatically
[07/24/2005 12:53 PM] Me: so to get it to display it just has to be added to those hide groups
[07/24/2005 12:53 PM] Me:      SetHiddenBits( HIDEHUD_HEALTH | HIDEHUD_PLAYERDEAD | HIDEHUD_NEEDSUIT );
 
[07/24/2005 12:54 PM] Me: then you add it to the resource file and your set to go
[07/24/2005 12:54 PM] Dan F: oh wtf
[07/24/2005 12:54 PM] Dan F: wow thats different
[07/24/2005 12:54 PM] Me: and i even found all the animation sequences and everything
[07/24/2005 12:54 PM] Me: whats different?
[07/24/2005 12:55 PM] Dan F: i didnt expect it to be done like that, the menu panels are much different
[07/24/2005 12:55 PM] Me: oh
[07/24/2005 12:55 PM] Me: yeah its pretty awesome and efficient code
[07/24/2005 12:55 PM] Me: i was impressed
[07/24/2005 12:56 PM] Me: basically i just copied the hud_health.cpp and replace every word Health with Oxygen and started piecing it together from there
[07/24/2005 12:56 PM] Dan F: sure
[07/24/2005 12:57 PM] Dan F: fuck i closed the file view tab 
[07/24/2005 12:57 PM] Dan F: how do i open that agian
[07/24/2005 12:57 PM] Me: also if you decide to try that you will have to declare it in c_baseplayer.cpp or player.cpp those two play a very important part in controling it
[07/24/2005 12:57 PM] Me: View -> Porject Explorer
[07/24/2005 12:57 PM] Me: *Project
[07/24/2005 12:58 PM] Dan F: there we go
[07/24/2005 12:58 PM] Me: lol
[07/24/2005 12:58 PM] Me: so we're good
[07/24/2005 12:58 PM] Dan F: so you had a list of stuff for me to do?
[07/24/2005 12:59 PM] Me: if you decide to copy a hud_* item to model ours after i would suggest copying the hud_suit
[07/24/2005 12:59 PM] Me: because we want loss of health to hurt it a little, and we want it to deplete naturally so also take a look at hud_battery

[07/24/2005 01:29 PM] Me: so i got this new version of G-Force
[07/24/2005 01:29 PM] Dan F: ?
[07/24/2005 01:30 PM] Me: its a visualizations program for WMP, WinAmp, Real, iCrap just about every player
[07/24/2005 01:30 PM] Me: its really awesome
[07/24/2005 01:30 PM] Me: and expandable, i could make my won visualization if i knew trig
[07/24/2005 01:31 PM] Me: *own
[07/24/2005 01:31 PM] Dan F: im going to base our o2 panel off of the hud_battery
[07/24/2005 01:31 PM] Me: sounds good
[07/24/2005 01:31 PM] Me: but show it numberic instead of the way they do it
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Me: numeric would be better
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Dan F: oh... whats the way they im confused
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Dan F: i forget lol
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Me: they do it with the little bar
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Me: that goes down and turns red
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Dan F: ohh battery is for the flashlight 
[07/24/2005 01:32 PM] Dan F: fuck that
[07/24/2005 01:33 PM] Dan F: yeah ok hud_suitpower then
[07/24/2005 01:33 PM] Me: well we will still have to look at battery because we need it to slowly deplete
[07/24/2005 01:34 PM] Me: so use hud Oxygen
[07/24/2005 01:35 PM] Me: and copy the hud_health and replace every Health with Oxygen and see where that gets you
[07/24/2005 01:35 PM] Me: it worked really well for me
[07/24/2005 01:39 PM] Me: do we want this train the be kind of a hover car thing where each one just hovers on the rail?
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Dan F: id be down for that
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Me: but their hover technology isn't strong enough to power a city of cars and ships?
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Dan F: not cars atleast
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Me: like the core was made to allow hover but because it failed only certain parts work and not very well
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Me: so its not powerful enough to make everything hover
[07/24/2005 01:40 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/24/2005 01:41 PM] Me: and their main power source comes from rocks mined from near the core
[07/24/2005 01:41 PM] Me: that's what powers the shields is they can shoot a small beam of energy into the rock and because of its unstable state it lets out a very large amount of energy
[07/24/2005 01:42 PM] Dan F: yeah that sounds good
[07/24/2005 01:42 PM] Me: so they have to shield the rock as well to project it from attack
[07/24/2005 01:42 PM] Dan F: yeah
[07/24/2005 01:49 PM] Me: another thing i want is a trigger_touch that triggers instantly
[07/24/2005 01:49 PM] Me: that's why the fog doesn't turn on instantly is because all the triggers have a .5 second delay
[07/24/2005 01:50 PM] Dan F: is that part of the map or the sdk thio
[07/24/2005 01:50 PM] Dan F: tho*
[07/24/2005 01:51 PM] Dan F: brb i need to shave
[07/24/2005 01:51 PM] Me: sdk

[07/28/2005 01:49 AM] Dan Fairaizl: no i think its good in the top righjt
[07/28/2005 01:49 AM] Me: but its right behind the battery symbol
[07/28/2005 01:49 AM] Me: did you already load it and try it?
[07/28/2005 01:49 AM] Dan Fairaizl: not yet, just a sec

[07/28/2005 01:55 AM] Dan Fairaizl: they dont need to be psp size to view or set as wallpaper
[07/28/2005 01:56 AM] Me: i could write a program to go through a list of desktop backgrounds i already have and have a little red box the size of the PSP resolution and all i would have to do is click the area i want to save and click next and it would automatically save it
[07/28/2005 01:56 AM] Me: that would be hot
[07/28/2005 01:57 AM] Me: yeah but if it is the wide screen resolution it looks so much better
[07/28/2005 01:57 AM] Me: besides what to i need the extra bytes for if i won't even be able to use them
[07/28/2005 01:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[07/28/2005 01:57 AM] Me: i would make this program in VB
[07/28/2005 01:57 AM] Me: then put it on my site for download
[07/28/2005 01:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: do it
[07/28/2005 01:58 AM] Me: i could even save it in different formats before you even get the project file loaded in C++
[07/28/2005 01:58 AM] Me: :-P
[07/28/2005 01:58 AM] Me: it would take me a day
[07/28/2005 01:58 AM] Me: tops
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thats impossible to do in C++
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: well not impossible
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: but hard
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: yeah not impossible
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: just really hard
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: we are editing an entire game in C++
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: it takes a shit load of code to load a bitmap or image
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: yeah i know
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: because everything you have to write yourself
[07/28/2005 01:59 AM] Me: no .Net Framework for you
[07/28/2005 02:00 AM] Me: Dot Net makes it so easy
[07/28/2005 02:00 AM] Me: PictureBox1.Image = "My Filename" done
[07/28/2005 02:00 AM] Me: saving it is a little more tricky
[07/28/2005 02:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: lol u suckj
[07/28/2005 02:01 AM] Dan Fairaizl: in C++ loading a bitmap takes a whole fuckin class of your own code
[07/28/2005 02:01 AM] Me: lol
[07/28/2005 02:01 AM] Me: framework 1.1 is already made for me to take advantage of
[07/28/2005 02:02 AM] Me: but saving an image from a certain image is harder because you have to save something that is super imposed on top of the PictureBox object
[07/28/2005 02:03 AM] Me: took me days to figure out back when .Net was relatively new
[07/28/2005 02:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: lol well now you know
[07/28/2005 02:03 AM] Me: no actually i am gonna have to refer back to some old source code because i can't remember a darn bit of it
[07/28/2005 02:04 AM] Dan Fairaizl: lol thats my biggest problem with coding now
[07/28/2005 02:04 AM] Dan Fairaizl: i need a brush up
[07/28/2005 02:04 AM] Me: yeah hey is there an easy way to append to a plain text file in PHP?
[07/28/2005 02:05 AM] Dan Fairaizl: fuck i know you can, and its not too hard, but i forget how
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Dan Fairaizl: oh lol yeah, fopen("filename", "a+")
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Me: nice
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Dan Fairaizl: a+ is for append
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Me: that makes sense
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Dan Fairaizl: well reading/writing
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Me: those darn rw+a+ are all linux commands
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[07/28/2005 02:07 AM] Dan Fairaizl: fuck linux
[07/28/2005 02:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: so hard to use
[07/28/2005 02:08 AM] Me: but stable
[07/28/2005 02:08 AM] Me: and powerful
[07/28/2005 02:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but it takes forever to learn
[07/28/2005 02:11 AM] Me: well i better get started on this program

[07/30/2005 11:45 AM] Me: get the e-mail?
[07/30/2005 11:45 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[07/30/2005 11:45 AM] Me: and?
[07/30/2005 11:45 AM] Dan Fairaizl: program has one big bug
[07/30/2005 11:45 AM] Me: what?
[07/30/2005 11:46 AM] Dan Fairaizl: the selection box that goes over the image doesnt stay where you want it
[07/30/2005 11:46 AM] Me: then uncheck double click saves
[07/30/2005 11:46 AM] Me: it is automatically saving it when you double click the selection box
[07/30/2005 11:47 AM] Me: its so that if you wanted to save lots of pictures in one sitting all you would have to do is double click then move on to the next one
[07/30/2005 11:48 AM] Me: if you uncheck "Double Click Saves" down in the bottom left, when you double click it will stay there until you use "File -> Save"
[07/30/2005 11:49 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ah hah thats what i wanted
[07/30/2005 11:50 AM] Me: n/p
[07/30/2005 11:50 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok yeah then i cant see anything wrong nopw
[07/30/2005 11:50 AM] Dan Fairaizl: now*
[07/30/2005 11:50 AM] Me: i just gave that option because i have so many pictures that i might convert to PSP size
[07/30/2005 11:50 AM] Me: so you can also load a text file list of all the pictures
[07/30/2005 11:51 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so when double click saves is checked, and you double click it askes to replace the image... replace the origianal>?
[07/30/2005 11:51 AM] Me: if your pictures are organized like mine:
 Sexy Woman 01.jpg
 Sexy Woman 02.jpg
 Sexy Woman 03.jpg
 Sexy Woman 04.jpg
 Sexy Woman 05.jpg
 Sexy Woman 06.jpg
 
[07/30/2005 11:51 AM] Me: its easier to make a list
[07/30/2005 11:52 AM] Me: well yes if you save it in the same place as the original
[07/30/2005 11:52 AM] Me: if it is the same file type
[07/30/2005 11:52 AM] Dan Fairaizl: otherwise it saves it where you set it down int eh boxc
[07/30/2005 11:53 AM] Me: but if you saved it in the default PSP Pictures, it is probably replacing the one you automatically created on your first double click
[07/30/2005 11:53 AM] Me: so i would check that folder to make sure there aren't any unwanted copies
[07/30/2005 11:53 AM] Me: My Documents > My Pictures > PSP Pictures
[07/30/2005 11:53 AM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[07/30/2005 11:54 AM] Me: but yeah use the file saving settings on the bottom right
[07/30/2005 11:54 AM] Me: select something from the dropdown list and it will automatically be changed in the settings below it 
[07/30/2005 11:55 AM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[07/30/2005 11:55 AM] Me: i suggest using no prefix or suffix and select save in PSP Pictures with no folder saving set that to 0
[07/30/2005 11:55 AM] Me: that's probably the best setting for you
[07/30/2005 11:56 AM] Me: for me however i am going to want to use a folder setting of 3 or so and in the PSP Pictures folder
[07/30/2005 11:56 AM] Me: any suggestions for features to add?
[07/30/2005 11:57 AM] Me: oh and, it does save it as the original file name plus the save settings unless you use the File menu Save
[07/30/2005 11:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[07/30/2005 11:58 AM] Me: good shit huh?
[07/30/2005 11:58 AM] Me: come on i need feature suggestions
[07/30/2005 11:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: the only thing i want to see is an open dialog that can show a preview, other than the crappy windows open 
[07/30/2005 11:58 AM] Me: is it exactly what you were looking for?  loads faster then Photoshop obviously and comes with a command line
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Me: you could change the view in the dialog to thumbnail
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but that sux
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Me: hmmm
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok somthing easier
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Me: i would have to make the dialog myself and i am not sure i know how to tap into the windows directory gui alone
[07/30/2005 11:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: when all files are closed, the gray area, i love programs what when you double click in there it opens the open file dialog
[07/30/2005 12:00 PM] Me: ok
[07/30/2005 12:00 PM] Me: n/p
[07/30/2005 12:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but you done good
[07/30/2005 12:05 PM] Me: i'll add those things now
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Me: hmmm its not passing the double click event through
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Me: because it is a parent form
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Me: that's strange
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sux
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: how come you can never do anyting to the parent?
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i hate that
[07/30/2005 12:08 PM] Me: yeah
[07/30/2005 12:10 PM] Me: yeah it doesn't like that idea
[07/30/2005 12:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[07/30/2005 12:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats too bad
[07/30/2005 12:12 PM] Me: yeah i don't know about the file preview either
[07/30/2005 12:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh well
[07/30/2005 12:12 PM] Me: besides its multi select, so you should just use thumbnails
[07/30/2005 12:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok, one more thing, id like to see a button that could open the save destination folder
[07/30/2005 12:13 PM] Me: all this shit is in VB 6
[07/30/2005 12:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: more convientient
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: not .net
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: open the save destination folder
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: ?
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the folder where all the pictures are being saved in
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: oh
[07/30/2005 12:14 PM] Me: i can do that
[07/30/2005 12:15 PM] Me: just the psp pictures folder or the folder specified in the textbox?
[07/30/2005 12:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: well im just using the PSP Pictures folder so thatd be fine for me
[07/30/2005 12:16 PM] Me: i can do either one
[07/30/2005 12:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: on man these pictures look so good on the psps screen

[08/18/2005 11:19 AM] Me: dude i have another fantasy you will like
[08/18/2005 11:20 AM] Me: in my house i am not going to have regular tile or carpeted floors
[08/18/2005 11:20 AM] Me: no i am going to have acrylic floors
[08/18/2005 11:21 AM] Me: with tiles that you can remove and replace, and even have different types of tile some will carpet some translucent or solid colors or even imatation wood or carbon fiber
[08/18/2005 11:22 AM] Me: then the supports for the tiles are going to be a grid that fit the tiles perfectly
[08/18/2005 11:23 AM] Me: the grid will sit ontop of the original floor creating lots of evenly shaped cubicals almost so you will be able to see through the acrylic into each little room on the floor
[08/18/2005 11:24 AM] Me: the walls of each room with have holes in them where wire can pass through and network my entire house and home audio systems together
[08/18/2005 11:24 AM] Me: all the power cords for the entire house and all the coaxial cords for the cable tv and all the security system cords will all be accessible
[08/18/2005 11:25 AM] Me: the tricky part, each acrylic panel that closes the top of the rooms with have metal conductors on each corner
[08/18/2005 11:26 AM] Me: these will connect with the security system and when a panel is removed or replaced it will be able to tell my computer exactly which panel in removed and exactly which type of panel is on the floor, be it wood, or acrylic, or just a solid tile
[08/18/2005 11:27 AM] Me: another possibility is that there are pressure sensors on each corner, when a panel is stepped on, it will tell me who stepped on it based on weight and exactly where they are in my house

[11/06/2005 02:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or is this something different
[11/06/2005 02:45 PM] Me: that thing is orgasmic, look at the specs on it, its got shader 3.0 which is currently the only thing that nvidia has over ati

[11/06/2005 02:46 PM] Me: but they will optimize the extra ddr for speed too
[11/06/2005 02:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: theyd better cause the 512 chips out now dont do anything as far as preformance 
[11/06/2005 02:46 PM] Me: i think they are only selling the AIW X800 XL with 256 now, even though that magazine was talking about the 512 ddr they added just so they could say they did it first
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thats it
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Me: but if you look at the specs on the site it says 256drr
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Me: so maybe they just did it to prove they could
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Me: got to love ati
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Me: i sent them an e-mail today complaining about their website design
[11/06/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah they only made the 512 to say we did it first, but its preformance was the same as the 256
[11/06/2005 02:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha whatd you say
[11/06/2005 02:48 PM] Me: they used the internet explorer scroll-bar style to make it nearly the same color as the background of the page so i let them know
[11/06/2005 02:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha
[11/06/2005 02:49 PM] Me: any non noobish web designer would know that higher contrast monitors tend to plend similar colors together
[11/06/2005 02:49 PM] Me: my mom kept telling me "there isn't a scroll bar i can't sign up"
[11/06/2005 02:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yup lol
[11/06/2005 02:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha

[11/06/2005 05:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh shit its at the staple center
[11/06/2005 05:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or right next to
[11/06/2005 05:59 PM] Me: whats that?
[11/06/2005 05:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its a basketball court for the kings/lakers
[11/06/2005 06:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: realy popular place
[11/06/2005 06:00 PM] Me: oh sweet
[11/06/2005 06:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/06/2005 06:00 PM] Me: omfg read the first fucking sentence on the idsoftware site
[11/06/2005 06:00 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.idsoftware.com/)http://www.idsoftware.com/
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh nice
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Me: but i have to live in dallas or relocate
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that sucks
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Me: i definitely and getting a job for them i meet all the requirements so do you
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Me: hey
[11/06/2005 06:02 PM] Me: wouldn't it be really awesome if we did that together
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Me: we take a trip there together after college and apply for the job
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Me: what if we both got in
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sure lol
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Me: i mean their so successful we would be making 80k starting no doubt
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: soooooo sick
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Me: how sick would that be, we would have the best jobs for the rest of our lives
[11/06/2005 06:03 PM] Me: i love id
[11/06/2005 06:04 PM] Me: hey have you seen jarhead?
[11/06/2005 06:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: NO not yet i want to
[11/06/2005 06:04 PM] Me: its fucking awesome
[11/06/2005 06:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man i so wanna see that
[11/06/2005 06:05 PM] Me: the quake 4 engine has some new features on the sky map i think you might be interested in, i noticed this while playing it, i'm not sure if half life 2 does this but animated skymaps, the walls on the skybox can actually be animated graphics, there was a line of electrical lights that flashed
[11/06/2005 06:05 PM] Me: quake 4 has some pretty beautiful skymaps
[11/06/2005 06:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i bet
[11/06/2005 06:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that sounds really awesome
[11/06/2005 06:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i always though about why an animated skybox could be done
[11/06/2005 06:07 PM] Me: yeah it would be amazing, HL2 might be able to do that i can't remember
[11/06/2005 06:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im not sure
[11/06/2005 06:07 PM] Me: Quake 4 SDK will be released soon if you want to do some work on it this summer
[11/06/2005 06:07 PM] Me: not to mention it shouldn't be to hard to do some realtime scenes which are always fun
[11/06/2005 06:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ohhh yeah thatd be sick
[11/06/2005 06:08 PM] Me: why don't we just work on a multiplayer mod this time, maybe even a war mod would be fun, then we can really mess around with the fun stuff not so much the required "story line" stuff
[11/06/2005 06:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but the story line is fun
[11/06/2005 06:09 PM] Me: well within reason, i think before we tried to hard
[11/06/2005 06:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but the ideas were great
[11/06/2005 06:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: man i still think about that game
[11/06/2005 06:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and how awesome it could be
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Me: the best part is, companies sprout up all over the place, like Silocon Ice the creators of Urban Terror, i mean what an opportunity to show of people skills, big gaming companies recruit from small organizations like that
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Me: it could be pretty awesome, but i just didn't see things coming together very fast
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Me: i mean valve also had a lot of proprietary stuff too
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Me: like converting to their formats was annoying
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah no kidding
[11/06/2005 06:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that was a pain in the ass
[11/06/2005 06:11 PM] Me: you look at the old quake 3 pak files and you find jpgs and wav files
[11/06/2005 06:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: easier
[11/06/2005 06:11 PM] Me: its been a while since i've looked at the newer stuff, but quake 3 was easy
[11/06/2005 06:11 PM] Me: tga files was the last step in creating a texture
[11/06/2005 06:11 PM] Me: piece of cake
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Me: and the standard 3ds models could be used and compiled
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Me: so much easier, i flew through mapping a lot faster
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Me: i think we should try it with quake 4
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Me: it would be amazing
[11/06/2005 06:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah anything that can work with 3ds files will cut down time
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Me: its less proprietary, we could use quark for mapping because they have been making id software mapping tools forever
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Me: and no doubt they already support doom 3
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh thats good
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Me: lets check it out
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok yeah all that would be much better
[11/06/2005 06:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i dont care which engine we use
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the hl2 one was pretty hard to find info on cause it was so new
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: plus i could find out where the fuck to start in that damn engine
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i like things that are more sequential
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.planetquake.com/quark/infobase/intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush)http://www.planetquake.com/quark/infobase/intro.terraing(Link: http://www.planetquake.com/quark/infobase/intro.terraingenerator.texture.html#paintbrush)enerator.texture.html#paintbrush
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Me: that's quite nice
[11/06/2005 06:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: now id's might not be any better, but lets try it
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Me: yeah but ID has been around longer
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: exactly
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Me: and they will use the same programming style on all their engines
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so there should be more documentation on that one
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Me: and they have had one hell of a lot of engines
[11/06/2005 06:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/06/2005 06:23 PM] Me: wow doom 3 and quake 4 come with a map editor
[11/06/2005 06:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: score
[11/06/2005 06:24 PM] Me: you type editor at the consol and it brings it up
[11/06/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: score
[11/06/2005 06:27 PM] Me: it looks a lot like quark
[11/06/2005 06:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: most editors do
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Me: in the spirit of vegas expos i should make a vegas map
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Me: with the different hotels
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be very hard
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Me: maybe a few
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Me: yeah
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Me: very hard
[11/06/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but very cool

[11/06/2005 07:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: for some reason it wont let me to that cause im returning a that char, and its being set in a for loop

[11/10/2005 07:58 PM] Me: so Nate came over to copy music, and i decided to open up my mouse to see if i could do one of these LED mods i found online and make my scroller glow, so i took off one of the feet of the mouse before realizing that there was only 1 screw and none under the feet, so i was gonna super glue the foot back on and i couldn't get it un-clogged so i gave it to Nate, bad idea, he asked for the pliers and i didn't even know what he was gonna do, until he started to squeeze the super glue, it sprayed everywhere, all over my monitor, it looks like jiz on the monitor, all over my $100 mouse and keyboard, lucky that was it, it could have hit my laptop man i woulda been pissed
[11/10/2005 07:58 PM] Me: amazing story right?

[11/10/2005 10:31 PM] Me: its pretty cool, it looks better without the plastic case on it, but the high voltage power supply is exposed so i don't want to leave it off
[11/10/2005 10:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah lol
[11/10/2005 10:32 PM] Me: might start fires

[11/10/2005 10:34 PM] Me: and i also found a full tower acrylic
[11/10/2005 10:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: really, that still seems kinda steep for a case
[11/10/2005 10:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/10/2005 10:35 PM] Me: nah
[11/10/2005 10:35 PM] Me: not that size

[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Me: but they have 270 dollar full tower acrylic cases
[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Me: and its bullshit
[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Me: it shouldn't be over 120
[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Me: that's twice as much as mine
[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats expensive
[11/10/2005 10:38 PM] Me: yeah
[11/10/2005 10:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you could buy the acrylic yourself and do it for cheaper
[11/10/2005 10:39 PM] Me: probably
[11/10/2005 10:39 PM] Me: dude i found $0.45 LEDs
[11/10/2005 10:39 PM] Me: i'm so happy

[11/10/2005 10:39 PM] Me: 10 of each color
[11/10/2005 10:40 PM] Me: 25 bucks
[11/10/2005 10:40 PM] Me: after i get a monitor
[11/10/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah .45 is the price i usually get them at

[11/11/2005 02:18 PM] Me: its alright
[11/11/2005 02:18 PM] Me: the fans aren't that strong
[11/11/2005 02:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it doesnt seem worth it to me
[11/11/2005 02:18 PM] Me: but the more air flow the better unless you go to water cooling
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Me: its more for display
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Me: because it flashes different colors
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol im not huge on neon anyways
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Me: and it is blowing cool air through my heatsink too
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i would love to go water cool but its so expensive
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Me: its regular LEDs
[11/11/2005 02:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: actually the price of water cooling is going down
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: i would look around
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its expeisive on xoxide
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: obviously thermatake is going to be expensive
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: but there are some nice cheep setups
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: i am going server case
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: i am sick of this shit
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but thermaltake is so good, im want one of their cases
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: i need to start modding
[11/11/2005 02:20 PM] Me: like real modding
[11/11/2005 02:21 PM] Me: like add my own damn glass panel to the side of a server case
[11/11/2005 02:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cold air intake, and 3 in turbo back exhaust?
[11/11/2005 02:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh sorry

[11/11/2005 02:21 PM] Me: ways to cool
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Me: no don't do 3 turbo back exhaust
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: liquid nitrogen?
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Me: dual exhaust is plenty
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh well
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Me: liquid nitrogen or dry ice
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Me: dude
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lets do it
[11/11/2005 02:22 PM] Me: ok imagine this
[11/11/2005 02:23 PM] Me: an acrylic encasing the size of a power supply
[11/11/2005 02:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/11/2005 02:23 PM] Me: a little latch door to change the ice
[11/11/2005 02:23 PM] Me: you clean out your computer really well
[11/11/2005 02:23 PM] Me: use some of that clear plastic tubbing to go through the dry ice and hook it up to your fans
[11/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: like my side fan and my back fan
[11/11/2005 02:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but the dry ice isnt that cold, its already frozen
[11/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: i have my back fan cone down to that tube, and hook it into the dry ice container and have that hook to another tube that cones intil my side fan
[11/11/2005 02:24 PM] Me: yeah
[11/11/2005 02:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmmm
[11/11/2005 02:25 PM] Me: we could put anything in the container that would cool off air really fast
[11/11/2005 02:25 PM] Me: its just a concept design of how we could make a cheap air cooler instead of water cooler
[11/11/2005 02:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but dry ice is expensive
[11/11/2005 02:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and it doesnt last very long
[11/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: we need something cheape
[11/11/2005 02:26 PM] Me: anywho
[11/11/2005 02:27 PM] Me: i want to put a fog machine up against my intake
[11/11/2005 02:27 PM] Me: and watch that shit float around
[11/11/2005 02:27 PM] Me: it would be amazing
[11/11/2005 02:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha yeah man

[11/11/2005 02:30 PM] Me: how about that one?
[11/11/2005 02:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: expensive
[11/11/2005 02:30 PM] Me: it doesn't have a cool base, but maybe i will just make my own base
[11/11/2005 02:30 PM] Me: its cheaper then the other one
[11/11/2005 02:30 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824197011)http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E(Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824197011)16824197011

[11/11/2005 02:36 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cutting is hard
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Me: i could get that and then practise on an old beige one and get good at modding
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Me: yeah but i think i would do it with a dremel and a really fine blade
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah test your skills first
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Me: then touch up with some case paint
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah cutting it out isnt hard, but mounting the plexi can be
[11/11/2005 02:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: depending on how you want to do it
[11/11/2005 02:38 PM] Me: then just find some short screws to put through it into a thin piece of acrylic

[11/15/2005 11:05 AM] Dan Fairaizl: we can use a dremel, so very presise
[11/15/2005 11:05 AM] Dan Fairaizl: as long as i have a template
[11/15/2005 11:06 AM] Dan Fairaizl: and we can use fiberglass to mold shit onto it to make cool shpaes
[11/15/2005 11:07 AM] Me: mold shit?  example?
[11/15/2005 11:07 AM] Me: sent
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: like anything, like how some cases have like megatron lookin dude on the front
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Me: oh, fiber glass for that?
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Me: hmmm
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: since we dont have tha ability to work with metal
[11/15/2005 11:08 AM] Dan Fairaizl: fiberglass is expensive tho
[11/15/2005 11:09 AM] Me: ok then i could ask my dad do send me the window parts
[11/15/2005 11:09 AM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[11/15/2005 11:09 AM] Me: then if we can cut the aluminum ourselves that would be better instead of having him do it
[11/15/2005 11:09 AM] Me: so take a look at the designs i send you
[11/15/2005 11:10 AM] Dan Fairaizl: havent gotten it yet...

[11/15/2005 11:12 AM] Me: sent
[11/15/2005 11:13 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so you want to etch thoes designs into the glass?
[11/15/2005 11:14 AM] Me: no all of the white is metal
[11/15/2005 11:14 AM] Me: the metal case
[11/15/2005 11:15 AM] Dan Fairaizl: but the light gray areas are sanded metal or plexiglass?
[11/15/2005 11:15 AM] Me: all of the light grey is dremel or sand the mirror finish so it isn't shiny
[11/15/2005 11:15 AM] Me: so that is metal too
[11/15/2005 11:15 AM] Me: the dark grey is the clear acrylic window
[11/15/2005 11:16 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok i getcha
[11/15/2005 11:16 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/15/2005 11:16 AM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmmm
[11/15/2005 11:17 AM] Me: the second one will be harder with the spiral
[11/15/2005 11:17 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/15/2005 11:17 AM] Me: and the text describing the equation is dremel or sanded or not a shiny finish
[11/15/2005 11:18 AM] Me: and the sine theta will be the logo we put on all of them in the upper right
[11/15/2005 11:18 AM] Dan Fairaizl: rough or smooth texture?
[11/15/2005 11:18 AM] Me: it will be smooth but it just won't be shiny
[11/15/2005 11:18 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 11:19 AM] Me: like we could sand all of it down and polish it so everything is mirrored, and then use a hard grain sand paper to scratch the grey part into it
[11/15/2005 11:19 AM] Dan Fairaizl: it will be rough if we do that tho
[11/15/2005 11:19 AM] Me: or if you have a small dremel head then we can scratch it with that
[11/15/2005 11:19 AM] Me: well not really rough
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: maybe a little
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: it just depends on the grain sandpaper we use or the dremel
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Dan Fairaizl: so what you are saying is that thoes parts are smooth but not highly polished
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: yes
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: the light grey parts are
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: do you have a dremel head that's small?
[11/15/2005 11:20 AM] Me: any diamond tip heads?
[11/15/2005 11:22 AM] Dan Fairaizl: i dont think so, i'll have to look again
[11/15/2005 11:22 AM] Me: let me find a picture

[11/15/2005 11:26 AM] Me: yeah but look at the street next to it, then look at the reflection
[11/15/2005 11:27 AM] Dan Fairaizl: dude thats fuckin shinny
[11/15/2005 11:27 AM] Me: (Link: http://www.hmcelectronics.com/cgi-bin/scripts/product/2560-0008)http://www.hmcelectronics.com/cgi-bin/scripts/product/25(Link: http://www.hmcelectronics.com/cgi-bin/scripts/product/2560-0008)60-0008 look at the picture and tell me if you have stuff like that
[11/15/2005 11:27 AM] Me: for a car
[11/15/2005 11:28 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah a have all that shit
[11/15/2005 11:28 AM] Me: now look at this (Link: http://metku.net/index.html?sect=view&n=1&path=mods/shinyshuttle/index_eng3)http://metku.net/index.html?sect=view&n=(Link: http://metku.net/index.html?sect=view&n=1&path=mods/shinyshuttle/index_eng3)1&path=mods/shinyshuttle/index_eng3
[11/15/2005 11:28 AM] Me: that is a perfect mirror
[11/15/2005 11:29 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok then do what he did
[11/15/2005 11:30 AM] Me: now a few problems, first how do we get the beige paint off?  second, what do we do with the beige front plastic cover?  will we need to design some custom front panel? or possibly ask the company for sponsorship and tell them to give us cases before they are painted?
[11/15/2005 11:31 AM] Dan Fairaizl: good luck with the sponorship, anything that is metal can be sanded down and the paint will come off, and there is nothing we can do with plastic
[11/15/2005 11:32 AM] Me: ok i guess that is what we will figure out over thanksgiving
[11/15/2005 11:32 AM] Me: i already have a case
[11/15/2005 11:32 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 11:32 AM] Me: and possibly a power supply we could try it on too
[11/15/2005 11:33 AM] Me: what if it sells dude?  i know i can get someone here to give me 80 bucks for it
[11/15/2005 11:34 AM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be pretty awesome
[11/15/2005 11:34 AM] Dan Fairaizl: then we'd have to buy more tools so we can do that faster
[11/15/2005 11:34 AM] Me: read that article i sent you
[11/15/2005 11:34 AM] Dan Fairaizl: whcih one the shinny case one
[11/15/2005 11:35 AM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 11:35 AM] Me: its amazing
[11/15/2005 11:41 AM] Me: if it isn't shiny enough with your method then we can order the english custom polish and try again
[11/15/2005 11:41 AM] Dan Fairaizl: we will need the polish regardless
[11/15/2005 11:41 AM] Me: don't you have chrome polish?
[11/15/2005 11:42 AM] Me: and do you have one of these? (Link: http://metku.net/mods/shinyshuttle/sanding.jpg)http://metku.net/mods/shinyshuttle/sanding.jpg
[11/15/2005 11:43 AM] Dan Fairaizl: i have an older sander, that should get the job done
[11/15/2005 11:43 AM] Me: otherwise we will have to do it by hand and that would not be fun
[11/15/2005 11:43 AM] Me: should i just order this polish now?
[11/15/2005 11:44 AM] Me: its more expensive then that chrome polish so it would probably be worth it to try that first
[11/15/2005 11:44 AM] Dan Fairaizl: how much?
[11/15/2005 11:44 AM] Me: about $12 a bottle
[11/15/2005 11:44 AM] Me: and i would have to get the 3 pack
[11/15/2005 11:44 AM] Me: $38
[11/15/2005 11:45 AM] Dan Fairaizl: its your call
[11/15/2005 11:45 AM] Me: do you have any chrome polish we can use?  or anywhere we can get some cheap and fast?
[11/15/2005 11:45 AM] Dan Fairaizl: we can get it at checkers
[11/15/2005 11:48 AM] Me: i'll just order this (Link: http://www.englishcustompolishing.com/usca/custom.html)http://www.englishcustompolishing.com(Link: http://www.englishcustompolishing.com/usca/custom.html)(Link: http://www.englishcustompolishing.com/usca/custom.html)/usca/custom.html and showman's
[11/15/2005 11:49 AM] Dan Fairaizl: that stuff sounds good
[11/15/2005 11:49 AM] Me: yeah definitely
[11/15/2005 11:50 AM] Me: $31
[11/15/2005 11:50 AM] Me: how much would a bottle of that chrome polish cost?
[11/15/2005 11:50 AM] Dan Fairaizl: it wont be too much
[11/15/2005 11:51 AM] Me: $10?
[11/15/2005 11:51 AM] Dan Fairaizl: (Link: http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductDetail.aspx?categorycode=3303&mfrcode=MRS&mfrpartnumber=05208)http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductDetail.aspx?categorycode=3303&mfrcode=MRS&mfrpartnumber=05208
[11/15/2005 11:52 AM] Me: hmmm
[11/15/2005 11:52 AM] Me: cheap
[11/15/2005 11:52 AM] Me: lets try that first
[11/15/2005 11:52 AM] Me: if it doesn't work then its only 5 dollars and you will be able to find some chrome to use it on anyways
[11/15/2005 11:53 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah as long as it sanded REALLY well then any polish should work prtty good
[11/15/2005 11:53 AM] Dan Fairaizl: im sure
[11/15/2005 11:53 AM] Me: ok
[11/15/2005 11:53 AM] Me: now where do we get these cloths
[11/15/2005 11:54 AM] Dan Fairaizl: i have a bunch of yellow microfiber shammies 
[11/15/2005 11:54 AM] Me: ok
[11/15/2005 11:54 AM] Me: if we could get an entire mid tower to look like that perfect mirror in the last picture that would be sexy
[11/15/2005 11:55 AM] Me: i'm quite excited
[11/15/2005 11:55 AM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be sexy
[11/15/2005 11:55 AM] Me: the hard part will be cutting the window design
[11/15/2005 11:56 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/15/2005 11:56 AM] Me: but i will bring a compas and draw it out
[11/15/2005 11:56 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/15/2005 11:57 AM] Me: oh yeah i was also thinking about cool lighting
[11/15/2005 11:57 AM] Me: you know the wave in the middle in that one picture/
[11/15/2005 11:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ??
[11/15/2005 11:57 AM] Me: so we cut a 1/4" acrylic or have my dad do it, in the same shape as the wave
[11/15/2005 11:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Me: ok then we take a fine sand paper to the acrylic to make it foggy
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be pretty cool
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: oh man thatd be sick
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Me: then we add LEDs in key places and it will light up amazing
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Me: the we attach it to the case, but slightly offset from the metal wave
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Me: so its like a lighted shadow
[11/15/2005 11:58 AM] Me: i know, i'm a genius
[11/15/2005 11:59 AM] Me: that would sell
[11/15/2005 11:59 AM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be badass
[11/15/2005 12:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and thatd fit perfectly with nolimit-designs.com :-D:-D
[11/15/2005 12:00 PM] Me: ok then the series of cases will be called sine theta
[11/15/2005 12:00 PM] Me: to bad that website doesn't exist
[11/15/2005 12:00 PM] Me: do you even have the domain?
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hell yeah i do
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Me: really?
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Me: how come no website?
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah lol
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cause i havent bough a hosting service yet
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Me: how about me
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Me: i even have ftp set up
[11/15/2005 12:01 PM] Me: right now
[11/15/2005 12:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lets make a case first, then we can take pictures of it and put them online
[11/15/2005 12:02 PM] Me: definitely

[11/15/2005 04:21 PM] Me: and realized i made them prettier still
[11/15/2005 04:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok give me the most current
[11/15/2005 04:22 PM] Me: sent
[11/15/2005 04:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: got it
[11/15/2005 04:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: looks good

[11/15/2005 04:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/15/2005 04:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: all the dark gray areas are the window right?
[11/15/2005 04:26 PM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 04:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 04:53 PM] Me: r=cos(theta)
[11/15/2005 04:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you send it to me?
[11/15/2005 05:04 PM] *** Dan Fairaizl wants to directly connect.
[11/15/2005 05:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: answer me!
[11/15/2005 05:16 PM] Me: i will
[11/15/2005 05:16 PM] Me: its not done yet
[11/15/2005 05:16 PM] Me: sorry
[11/15/2005 05:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i put that sine theta on a case picture
[11/15/2005 05:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whats ur email
[11/15/2005 05:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: n/m
[11/15/2005 05:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: check ur email
[11/15/2005 05:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its just to get an idea on how that could look
[11/15/2005 05:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ack i'll make a better one after my lab tongiht
[11/15/2005 05:20 PM] Me: these things are hard to make with all the layers
[11/15/2005 05:20 PM] Me: it would be so much easier to do on paper or side of the case
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: not necessarily, i can use illistrator to create a vector image of it, that can be scaled to any size
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Me: sent r=cos(1/2x)
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then we can just print the template out
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Me: i don't know
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Me: maybe
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that would be easy man
[11/15/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dont contradict me
[11/15/2005 05:22 PM] Me: lol
[11/15/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh that one is badass
[11/15/2005 05:22 PM] Me: you have the right tools to cut this precise?
[11/15/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we'll find out
[11/15/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: probably not
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cutting the metal case will be the hardest
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but i can think of a few good ways to do that
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Me: and some of the widths of these things can be expanded
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we can use a tin cutter to get most of the metal out then use a dremel to curve it
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Me: like the one i just sent you is pretty thin
[11/15/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i just used exactly what you created
[11/15/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i will make a better one tongiht
[11/15/2005 05:24 PM] Me: my dad also might by able to laser or water cut it
[11/15/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thatd be good, but i say lets make a set first so we have an idea of what sizes these shapes need to be
[11/15/2005 05:25 PM] Me: well the outside of the window and the grid will stay mostly generic
[11/15/2005 05:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what do you mean
[11/15/2005 05:26 PM] Me: the outside border and the axis will be mostly the same on every one
[11/15/2005 05:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh yeah
[11/15/2005 05:27 PM] Me: except for the one i had to move it over
[11/15/2005 05:27 PM] Me: did you e-mail me something?
[11/15/2005 05:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nope
[11/15/2005 05:28 PM] Me: r=10*sin(5*x)
[11/15/2005 05:28 PM] Me: that one is next
[11/15/2005 05:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats like a flower 
[11/15/2005 05:29 PM] Me: no then?
[11/15/2005 05:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wait what 10sin(5x) is a flower
[11/15/2005 05:29 PM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok yeah
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: instead how about greek symbols?
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: pi
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: really big
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: in the middle
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i like the more simple abstract designs like these
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: yeah
[11/15/2005 05:30 PM] Me: but i know someone who would buy pi
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Me: hes a math person
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Me: i'll ask him
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Me: if he says he will buy it and puts some money down then we can do it
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Me: and sell it
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Me: and pay for stuff we need to do it better
[11/15/2005 05:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be cool
[11/15/2005 05:32 PM] Me: like a new sander, or diamond dremel bits
[11/15/2005 05:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sander will be the thing we will need the most
[11/15/2005 05:32 PM] Me: oOo
[11/15/2005 05:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: a good power sander
[11/15/2005 05:34 PM] Me: how about y=sin^1(x)
[11/15/2005 05:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whats that one look like?
[11/15/2005 05:36 PM] Me: nvm
[11/15/2005 05:36 PM] Me: i could do tan
[11/15/2005 05:37 PM] Me: its the repeated quadratic equations with powers of 2
[11/15/2005 05:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/15/2005 05:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: aight man keep thinking i need to go to class
[11/15/2005 05:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i'll be back at 8
[11/15/2005 05:38 PM] Me: ttyl
[11/15/2005 05:46 PM] Me: i just thought of another great place to put a light, in the rounded corners we put the same kind of sanded acrylic and offset them slightly towards the center
[11/15/2005 05:46 PM] *** Auto-response from Dan Fairaizl: In class
[11/15/2005 05:59 PM] Me: Steve said i could have the case, there might also be a power supply in there to test LEDs and lighting with

[11/16/2005 10:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i wanna make one for each, and work on the neon lighting a bit
[11/16/2005 10:58 PM] Me: my dad will cut aluminum for us
[11/16/2005 10:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats awesome
[11/16/2005 10:58 PM] Me: but i don't think he understands that the panel has to fit onto the case
[11/16/2005 10:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[11/16/2005 10:59 PM] Me: he also said we should start with polished
[11/16/2005 10:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: polished what?
[11/16/2005 11:00 PM] Me: polished aluminum
[11/16/2005 11:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh lol yeah thatd save a ton of time
[11/16/2005 11:01 PM] Me: but we have to fit the panel into the case
[11/16/2005 11:01 PM] Me: and every case is different
[11/16/2005 11:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thats gunna be tough
[11/16/2005 11:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we'll have to think about that
[11/16/2005 11:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: anyways man im going to crash im so tired
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Me: i mean i could send him one and ask him if he can duplicate it with polished aluminum
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Me: then we can just mirror it and have him cut it
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Me: he has all the equipment
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats true
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that could work really well
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh and i had a really good idea to make the parts light up
[11/16/2005 11:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: leds are too directional
[11/16/2005 11:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so i say we use neon el wire along the parts
[11/16/2005 11:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that will create an even glow
[11/16/2005 11:03 PM] Me: we could to that
[11/16/2005 11:03 PM] Me: but they won't be to directional with the foggy acrylic
[11/16/2005 11:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was getting to that lol, no the foggy parts will light up fully and look sick as hell
[11/16/2005 11:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok now its time for bed

[11/17/2005 02:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what are we going to need? good, we need sheet metal if we are to make our own sides, acrylic, and some kind of glue that can glue acrylic together without looking crapy
[11/17/2005 02:07 PM] Me: he can send us that
[11/17/2005 02:07 PM] Me: and also cut anything we need
[11/17/2005 02:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i say we make one first to get the correct dimensions and see how it turns out, then he can make them much easier
[11/17/2005 02:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cause now all new have is a picture
[11/17/2005 02:08 PM] Me: yeah we need to decide if we need to start the side panels from scratch or if we are going to spend all the time sanding them

[11/19/2005 03:16 PM] Me: takes to long
[11/19/2005 03:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok 
[11/19/2005 03:18 PM] Me: download this and replace the pictures (Link: http://134.114.59.162/backgrounds.rar)http://134.114.59.162/backgrounds.rar

[11/19/2005 03:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[11/19/2005 03:20 PM] Me: just remember, sunset is always equal to 9:00PM in the colors file
[11/19/2005 03:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: why 9?
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Me: because that's the average time for sunset
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wtf
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Me: and sunrise is 7
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: 9 pm is sunset???
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Me: should it be 8?
[11/19/2005 03:21 PM] Me: it matched the colors at the time
[11/19/2005 03:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats seems way late but if it works
[11/19/2005 03:22 PM] Me: i'll change it to 8
[11/19/2005 03:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so when the sunsets at 5:22 tonight, thats when the background will go dark right?
[11/19/2005 03:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or darker
[11/19/2005 03:22 PM] Me: yeah
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and its totally dark at 9?
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Me: 5:22 will be offset to 9:00 in the colors file
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Me: but i will change it to earlier
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: id do earlier
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Me: so maybe 7 should be sunset and sunrise
[11/19/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that sounds better

[11/19/2005 07:06 AM] Me: damn i am so awesome
[11/19/2005 07:06 AM] Me: it works better
[11/19/2005 07:06 AM] Me: 7 Am sunrise and 7PM sunset
[11/19/2005 07:06 AM] Me: so set your colors file accordingly
[11/19/2005 07:06 AM] Dan Fairaizl: how come at midnight, its bright blue
[11/19/2005 03:28 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ack nm
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you know what else would be awesome? a star field at night
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: lol
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: hmmm
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: put it un the picture file
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: i was thinking
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: its so hard to do image generation
[11/19/2005 03:28 PM] Me: it take to much CPU
[11/19/2005 03:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i understand that
[11/19/2005 03:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: too bad you cant overlay images
[11/19/2005 03:29 PM] Me: so maybe i should divide up the sky and grass file again
[11/19/2005 03:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that would be cool
[11/19/2005 03:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: id be good to make the grass darker at night
[11/19/2005 03:30 PM] Me: so that it will draw the grass that you can make darker, and draw the sky, but then have a list of certain variables from weather.com that determines the picture too
[11/19/2005 03:30 PM] Me: the grass does get darker at night with the images i give you
[11/19/2005 03:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: can it be done?
[11/19/2005 03:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sorta
[11/19/2005 03:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: at midnight the grass is extremely bright
[11/19/2005 03:32 PM] Me: so there will be a simple view like the options there now, but the advanced pictures view will include rendering options, gama is easy to implement, and also depending on the exact time of day and certain variables from weather.com it will change the picture until the next variable comes along
[11/19/2005 03:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that would be extremely badass
[11/19/2005 03:33 PM] Me: its very possible(Link: http://134.114.59.162/Weather)
[11/19/2005 03:33 PM] Me: i'll get working on it
[11/19/2005 03:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok and i'll work on the color variables
[11/19/2005 03:33 PM] Me: 134.114.59.162/weather%20desktop.exe
[11/19/2005 03:33 PM] Me: (Link: http://134.114.59.162/weather%20desktop.exe)http://134.114.59.162/weather%20desktop.exe(Link: http://134.114.59.162/weather%20desktop.exe)
[11/19/2005 03:34 PM] Me: re-download the exe with the time change in it
[11/19/2005 03:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/19/2005 03:34 PM] Me: to see your 7:00PM or AM sunset and sunrise you would set you local time to the sunrise and sunset on weather.com
[11/19/2005 03:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/19/2005 03:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what are the 5 values in colors doing
[11/19/2005 03:40 PM] Me: phades between the 5
[11/19/2005 03:40 PM] Me: so the bottom one you can't really see
[11/19/2005 03:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so it takes all 5 of thoes values and that resulting color is shows on the desktop
[11/19/2005 03:41 PM] Me: yeah
[11/19/2005 03:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: gotcha
[11/19/2005 03:42 PM] Me: its pretty
[11/19/2005 03:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: very
[11/19/2005 03:42 PM] Me: have to restart the program when you change the colors file, but not when you change the time
[11/19/2005 03:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/19/2005 03:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the times are still kinda off, down here atleast 8am looks like 9 am
[11/19/2005 03:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it should be offset by an hour, so 8 should be 7 ect
[11/19/2005 03:46 PM] Me: ...
[11/19/2005 03:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the mornings are off
[11/19/2005 03:48 PM] Me: ok ok so what happens if you change your system time to the sunset time
[11/19/2005 03:48 PM] Me: then under the offset where it says H and M it should say H 19 M 0
[11/19/2005 03:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its still really bright
[11/19/2005 03:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: mine says 10 o

[11/19/2005 06:57 PM] Me: it takes 12 hours between 7AM and 7PM
[11/19/2005 06:57 PM] Me: it converts that to minutes
[11/19/2005 06:57 PM] Me: then it takes the time between sunrise and sunset
[11/19/2005 06:57 PM] Me: and converts that to minutes
[11/19/2005 06:58 PM] Me: so say its 7 AM sunrise but 530 sunset
[11/19/2005 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/19/2005 06:58 PM] Me: that's only 10 and a half hours different
[11/19/2005 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/19/2005 06:59 PM] Me: so then it divides the sunrise and sunset by the standard to get the ratio of different
[11/19/2005 07:00 PM] Me: and it converts the current local time to minutes and multiplies it buy the ratio and add it to the morning
[11/19/2005 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wow
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: yeah
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: so there must be something wrong with the equation
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: took me forever to get this far
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol yeah man, these are just little details
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no one else is really going to notice that mcuh
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: yeah but they are very important
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i dunno, other CS majors are going to see a difference
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but my parents wont
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you see? lol
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Me: we don't want your sunrise colors to show up two hours late
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thats the only problem
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sun set seems to work really well
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh and one thing that would be really useful, is a button to get the rss from weather.com whenever the users wants 
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: yeah true
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: a refresh button
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: no problem
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be easy
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and good
[11/19/2005 05:22 PM] Me: yeah
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: this is badass man
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Me: this is so confusing
[11/19/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i bet lol
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Me: ok i think i got it
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: w00t
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Me: first i was adding the sunrise from weather back on, but only the hours not the 57 minutes
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh ok
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd do it
[11/19/2005 05:24 PM] Me: however i should instead add on the 7 sunrise from the colors file
[11/19/2005 05:25 PM] Me: not 6:57 from weather
[11/19/2005 05:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/19/2005 05:25 PM] Me: now to figure out the sunset
[11/19/2005 05:25 PM] Me: *sunrise
[11/19/2005 05:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm

[11/19/2005 07:19 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but its not used by windows, only other applications
[11/19/2005 07:19 AM] Me: ...dan

[11/19/2005 07:21 AM] Dan Fairaizl: translusency is not used by windows very much, i.e the windows explorer doesnt do that, which it does now
[11/19/2005 07:21 AM] Dan Fairaizl: only 3rd party programs utilize that
[11/19/2005 07:21 AM] Me: yeah
[11/19/2005 07:21 AM] Me: i know
[11/19/2005 07:21 AM] Me: you're right windows never really expanded on it

[11/19/2005 10:12 PM] Me: and how should i implement multiple picture being overlayed?  should someone be able to set two events the same and draw two overlaying pictures?

[11/19/2005 11:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i know lol
[11/19/2005 11:59 PM] Me: ok it stays down around 23 mgs now
[11/19/2005 11:59 PM] Me: what do you think?
[11/19/2005 11:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it was just an excuse to make a new architecture and a new compiler/dev studio they can charge a grand for
[11/20/2005 12:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: still a bit big but much better
[11/20/2005 12:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: mine is 40k
[11/20/2005 12:00 AM] Me: yeah it will keep growing too if you keep clicking apply
[11/20/2005 12:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[11/20/2005 12:01 AM] Me: but i just fixed it so it goes back
[11/20/2005 12:01 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok good
[11/20/2005 12:01 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok man im going to crash
[11/20/2005 12:01 AM] Dan Fairaizl: tty tomarrow
[11/20/2005 12:02 AM] Dan Fairaizl: dont stay up all night working on this lol
[11/20/2005 12:02 AM] Me: did you look at it?
[11/20/2005 12:02 AM] Me: its amazing
[11/20/2005 12:02 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah seems pretty badass
[11/20/2005 12:02 AM] Me: you will have to play around with the overlays tomorrow
[11/20/2005 12:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: i look forward to it
[11/20/2005 12:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: later man
[11/20/2005 12:03 AM] Me: ttyl

[11/20/2005 01:24 PM] Me: hey
[11/20/2005 01:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what up
[11/20/2005 01:24 PM] Me: 2 things
[11/20/2005 01:25 PM] Me: 1 you know if you go back to the marriott they are gonna ask you to work thanksgiving, i garuntee at least 1 manager will
[11/20/2005 01:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im going to go back, and if they ask, im going to say no
[11/20/2005 01:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i have a paper due after break
[11/20/2005 01:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and my family is in town
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: not really but thats my story
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Me: 2 there is no way for me to get rid of the ever increasing memory usage in the program, i have tried everything to get rid of it, and every subroutine does it
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that kinda sucks
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Me: do you really have a paper due/
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Me: ?
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the wednesday after we get back
[11/20/2005 01:26 PM] Me: and is it even possible to rewrite this in C++?
[11/20/2005 01:27 PM] Me: because C++ will catch the memory leaks
[11/20/2005 01:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was thinking about that actually, yes it will be much more efficient and we should look into that
[11/20/2005 01:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cause you arnt doing anything too complex so this shouldnt be tooooo hard to recreate
[11/20/2005 01:27 PM] Me: its pretty complet
[11/20/2005 01:27 PM] Me: *complex
[11/20/2005 01:28 PM] Me: list views in C++?
[11/20/2005 01:28 PM] Me: doubt it
[11/20/2005 01:28 PM] Me: not with the API, and this is the most efficient program i have ever written
[11/20/2005 01:28 PM] Me: i wish you could see the code, there is so little of it for all that it does
[11/20/2005 01:28 PM] Me: not even 2000 lines including whitespace
[11/20/2005 01:29 PM] Me: everything is done perfectly it is just that damned .net framework that doesn't dispose properly
[11/20/2005 01:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: if i recreate the dialog in C++ MFC do you wanna try making this work? cause that shouldnt be too hard to add functionality after that
[11/20/2005 01:30 PM] Me: if you can get a list view and tab pages working perfectly then lets do it, all the rest is easy your right
[11/20/2005 01:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah the list view and tabs will take the longest, but ive done tabs a lot before
[11/20/2005 01:31 PM] Me: we will have to figure out how to compile images and draw them, but putting them on the desktop is just a WINDOWS API call that should work in C++ too
[11/20/2005 01:31 PM] Me: so tabs and listview and we will do it
[11/20/2005 01:31 PM] Me: because everything else is pretty standard
[11/20/2005 01:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok compiling images will be more difficult ive never done that before
[11/20/2005 01:31 PM] Me: also initialize a custom dialog, like another form
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that easy
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Me: ok
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Me: good
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Me: i think that is everything
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok i'll get started on that as soon as i can 
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Me: and the tabpages don't have to refer to eachother
[11/20/2005 01:32 PM] Me: just store what is on them in a variable is all they have to do
[11/20/2005 01:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok GOOD it is impossible to make tabs interact with each other lmfao
[11/20/2005 01:33 PM] Me: yeah kinda weird
[11/20/2005 01:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i wanted to do that so bad, and the whole program would crash when i tried to send data
[11/20/2005 01:33 PM] Me: what if the values on one page were sent to a variable and on the other page read from that variable?
[11/20/2005 01:34 PM] Me: and the variable is declared in the header and it still doesn't work?
[11/20/2005 01:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: my knowledge of this is much better now then the last time i did that, so i'll see what i can do
[11/20/2005 01:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im sure i can figure it out now
[11/20/2005 01:36 PM] Me: ok but we don't need the pages to interact with eachother we just need what is on the pages to be able to be read by the main subroutines
[11/20/2005 01:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that shouldnt be a problem then, i can work around it, perhads another helper class to store that data will be easier
[11/20/2005 01:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we can work around it
[11/20/2005 01:37 PM] Me: but the listview is most important
[11/20/2005 01:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok i'll figure out how to get that to work
[11/20/2005 01:37 PM] Me: you know this will take twice as long to do right?
[11/20/2005 01:38 PM] Me: it took me about a week to get it where it is now
[11/20/2005 01:38 PM] Me: its going to take us no less then 3
[11/20/2005 01:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: 3 weeks? lol
[11/20/2005 01:38 PM] Me: yeah at least
[11/20/2005 01:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok thats fine
[11/20/2005 01:39 PM] Me: .Net programming is fast, because they do the complicated stuff for you
[11/20/2005 01:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thankfully
[11/20/2005 01:42 PM] Me: oh yeah one more thing, we will need timers to call subroutines
[11/20/2005 01:42 PM] Me: for updating info and such
[11/20/2005 01:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok timers arnt too bad
[11/20/2005 01:43 PM] Me:     void AutoSizeControl(Control* control, int textPadding) 
     { 
         // Create a Graphics object for the Control. 
         Graphics* g = control->CreateGraphics(); 
  
         // Get the Size needed to accommodate the formatted Text. 
         System::Drawing::Size preferredSize = g->MeasureString( 
             control->Text, control->Font).ToSize(); 
  
         // Pad the text and resize the control. 
         control->ClientSize = System::Drawing::Size( 
             preferredSize.Width + (textPadding * 2),  
             preferredSize.Height+(textPadding * 2) ); 
  
         // Clean up the Graphics object. 
         g->Dispose(); 
     } 
  
 
[11/20/2005 01:43 PM] Me: it will create graphics, it still uses the .Net framework but it will be more efficient
[11/20/2005 01:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that doesnt look too bad
[11/20/2005 01:46 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.northstar.k12.ak.us/schools/beh/departments/science/mcconnell/instructions.html)http://www.northstar.k12.ak.us/schools/beh/departments/(Link: http://www.northstar.k12.ak.us/schools/beh/departments/science/mcconnell/instructions.html)science/mcconnell/instructions.html
[11/20/2005 01:47 PM] Me: some more .Net framework C++ graphics
[11/20/2005 01:47 PM] Me: still more efficient if disposed of properly
[11/20/2005 01:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats console stuff dude
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: more or less
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Me: its C++
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats werid, its getting info from a console, and like drawing a window
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but its different
[11/20/2005 01:48 PM] Me: its the framework
[11/20/2005 01:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: aight aight
[11/20/2005 01:49 PM] Me: i don't know how else we are gonna create the graphics to be set onto the desktop
[11/20/2005 01:49 PM] Me: its gonna be abitch
[11/20/2005 01:50 PM] Me: (Link: http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/main-en.php)http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/main-en.php
[11/20/2005 01:50 PM] Me: oOoOoOo
[11/20/2005 01:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: seems to be we are going to have to create the background, and save it to a bitmap or something, then keep creating a new image each time
[11/20/2005 01:50 PM] Me: exactly
[11/20/2005 01:50 PM] Me: that's what it does now
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Me: it just doesn't dispose properly
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Me: like even the most simple routine doesn't dispose
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Me: it doesn't let me dispose new variables either
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: gay
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Me: so if i keep running the same small routine it keeps building up in memory
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah C++ is all about destroying shit
[11/20/2005 01:51 PM] Me: i don't understand it
[11/20/2005 01:52 PM] Me: lol microsoft Troolean
[11/20/2005 01:52 PM] Me: instead of Boolean
[11/20/2005 01:52 PM] Me: fuckers
[11/20/2005 01:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wtf
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: non-zero, zero, and -1
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: fun
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: its used everywhere in .Net
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: that's a good name for it
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol i guess
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: damn them
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: remember when this used to be simple
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmfao no kidding
[11/20/2005 01:53 PM] Me: back in the days of cross platform C
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: severl years ago when i was good at this it was simple, now i hope everything hasent changed
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Me: C++ hasn't
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but all the .net stuff im not too farmiliar with
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Me: they just added a shitload of libraries that would probably cause problems just like in VB
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol yeah
[11/20/2005 01:54 PM] Me: we will figure it out
[11/20/2005 01:55 PM] Me: i have to write an essay today
[11/20/2005 01:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i get to finish one, and finish this stupid java program
[11/20/2005 01:55 PM] Me: what major are you thinking about switching to?
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: info management systems
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its gunna be great
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Me: yeah that's like our CIS major i think
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Me: you know they will teach you Vb.net right?
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: plus my cs 127a class can replace an mis class so i get credit for it
[11/20/2005 01:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nah its business more than programing
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: and you realize that once you get hired by a software company they are gonna send you back to learn Java
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: that's what they are hiring these days
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: only because its cross platform
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: bastards
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol it'll all be ok
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: java is a part is MIS
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: ok
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Me: cool
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so is MS certification
[11/20/2005 01:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: :-\
[11/20/2005 01:58 PM] Me: oOo i can't wait until Mac OS switches to x86 its gonna be fun! .Net Framework for Mac YAY!
[11/20/2005 01:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wow, mac is crazy enough as it is
[11/20/2005 01:58 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:16 PM] Me: i have to know when you want to hang out this thanksgiving
[11/20/2005 02:16 PM] Me: friday saturday or both?
[11/20/2005 02:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: both
[11/20/2005 02:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whenever you want
[11/20/2005 02:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: when you gettin back to Pho town
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Me: wednesday afterneed
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i'll be home tuesday 
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Me: *afternoon
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh ok
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Me: like 4 hopefully
[11/20/2005 02:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/20/2005 02:22 PM] Me: damnit this pisses me off
[11/20/2005 02:22 PM] Me: it just keeps growing
[11/20/2005 02:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 02:22 PM] Me: now we have to fucking do this
[11/20/2005 02:22 PM] Me: it makes me angry
[11/20/2005 02:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha man there is soo much to do and not enough time
[11/20/2005 02:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: this sucks
[11/20/2005 02:23 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you and i need to go into business after college to start making sick programs
[11/20/2005 02:24 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:24 PM] Me: fuck
[11/20/2005 02:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ?
[11/20/2005 02:24 PM] Me: a blank form in C++ is only 1mg
[11/20/2005 02:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: how big is it in vb?
[11/20/2005 02:25 PM] Me: its a windows forms application is what we want right?
[11/20/2005 02:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah its called MFC
[11/20/2005 02:26 PM] Me: oh
[11/20/2005 02:26 PM] Me: nvm wrong one
[11/20/2005 02:26 PM] Me: in VB a blank form is 14 mgs
[11/20/2005 02:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: holy shit
[11/20/2005 02:27 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:27 PM] Me: single or multiple document?
[11/20/2005 02:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dialog based
[11/20/2005 02:27 PM] Me: what is an HTML dialog?
[11/20/2005 02:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: never used it
[11/20/2005 02:29 PM] Me: yay i will have to give you the manifest file to give your forms IN VS the windows GUI
[11/20/2005 02:29 PM] Me: its perty
[11/20/2005 02:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol ok
[11/20/2005 02:29 PM] Me: wow with this a blank is only 3.7
[11/20/2005 02:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wh00t
[11/20/2005 02:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: efficient
[11/20/2005 02:30 PM] Me: we will see
[11/20/2005 02:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dude it has to be smaller than vb
[11/20/2005 02:31 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:37 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html)http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Program(Link: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html)ming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html
[11/20/2005 02:37 PM] Me: where do i put that in the dialog code?
[11/20/2005 02:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: looks like you can put that anywhere, jsut make it a seperate function, and call that to set the background
[11/20/2005 02:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then call the function after the bmp has been created
[11/20/2005 02:39 PM] Me: call it from the button OnBnClickedOk right?
[11/20/2005 02:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and just give it all thoes paramaters
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: c:\Documents and Settings\Brian Cullinan\My Documents\Visual Studio Projects\Weather Desktop C++\Weather Desktop C++dlg.cpp(155): warning C4129: 'e' : unrecognized character escape sequence 
 
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: :'(
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: just make compiler happy
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: oh
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: dur dur dur
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: \e
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 02:40 PM] Me: <-fuck stupid
[11/20/2005 02:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmfao dude thats an easy mistake
[11/20/2005 02:42 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 02:42 PM] Me: i do that all the time
[11/20/2005 02:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: me too
[11/20/2005 02:42 PM] Me: got to remember those damn escape characters in C++
[11/20/2005 02:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: only in java which sucks more
[11/20/2005 02:43 PM] Me: it worked
[11/20/2005 02:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: score
[11/20/2005 02:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok now we get to figure out how to have the code make us a bmp
[11/20/2005 02:43 PM] Me: yes
[11/20/2005 02:43 PM] Me: easy enough i'll just download some code
[11/20/2005 02:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 02:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yup
[11/20/2005 02:44 PM] Me: maybe it didn't work
[11/20/2005 02:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ...
[11/20/2005 02:45 PM] Me: its the same API just a different language
[11/20/2005 02:45 PM] Me: give me a minute
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Me: ok wtf
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ?
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Me: it made my desktop blank
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Me: its the same fucking API call!!!
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: did it read the file path right?
[11/20/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: try double back slashes
[11/20/2005 02:48 PM] Me: i did
[11/20/2005 02:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[11/20/2005 02:48 PM] Me: does the . have to be \.
[11/20/2005 02:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: shouldnt 
[11/20/2005 02:49 PM] Me: do API variables need to be declared?
[11/20/2005 02:49 PM] Me: it isn't giving me any errors
[11/20/2005 02:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what are the errors
[11/20/2005 02:50 PM] Me: one
[11/20/2005 02:50 PM] Me: none
[11/20/2005 02:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: let me see the code
[11/20/2005 02:50 PM] Me:      SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER,0,"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Brian Cullinan\\My Documents\\My Pictures\\3D Ghost.jpg",SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE || SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE); 
 
[11/20/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and its just doing nothing?
[11/20/2005 02:51 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html)http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Program(Link: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Programming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html)ming_Platforms/Win_Prog/Q_21620196.html
[11/20/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh wait
[11/20/2005 02:51 PM] Me: wtf it isn't on that page anymore
[11/20/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: try a dir that has no spaces C:\\dir\\image.bmp
[11/20/2005 02:52 PM] Me: ok
[11/20/2005 02:52 PM] Me: or add \"
[11/20/2005 02:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: try no spaces
[11/20/2005 02:52 PM] Me: ok
[11/20/2005 02:53 PM] Me: still nothing
[11/20/2005 02:56 PM] Me: what is a PVOID data type?
[11/20/2005 02:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that i dont really know, never used it 
[11/20/2005 02:58 PM] Me:     Private Const SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER As Integer = &H14 
     Private Const SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE As Integer = &H1 
     Private Const SPIF_SENDWININICHANGE As Integer = &H2 
 
[11/20/2005 02:58 PM] Me: how do i make that C++?
[11/20/2005 02:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whoa whoa, tell me what the first line does first lol
[11/20/2005 02:59 PM] Me: constant integer from a hex value
[11/20/2005 02:59 PM] Me: does it automatically convert hex integers?
[11/20/2005 02:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: private const int varname = value
[11/20/2005 03:00 PM] Me: hey also this says  Private Declare Auto Function SystemParametersInfo
[11/20/2005 03:00 PM] Me: i think the Auto is what makes it work
[11/20/2005 03:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: is that all basic?
[11/20/2005 03:00 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 03:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what is auto
[11/20/2005 03:01 PM] Me: don't know
[11/20/2005 03:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 03:03 PM] Me: c:\Documents and Settings\Brian Cullinan\My Documents\Visual Studio Projects\Weather Desktop C++\Weather Desktop C++dlg.cpp(33): error C2059: syntax error : 'constant' 
 
[11/20/2005 03:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: const
[11/20/2005 03:03 PM] Me: it says const
[11/20/2005 03:03 PM] Me: and its blue
[11/20/2005 03:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whats on that line
[11/20/2005 03:04 PM] Me: &H14 that doesn't work as an integer does it?
[11/20/2005 03:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nope
[11/20/2005 03:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that a hex value?
[11/20/2005 03:04 PM] Me: hmm
[11/20/2005 03:04 PM] Me: i think so
[11/20/2005 03:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ive never seen the & sign
[11/20/2005 03:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: why does that need to be hex
[11/20/2005 03:05 PM] Me: not sure
[11/20/2005 03:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol wow im confused, where id you get that basic code from?
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Me: i made it
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so what does the &h14 do?
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: in basic
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Me: its a pretty standard API call all the values are represented in hex, &H means hex in VB
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Me: it converts it
[11/20/2005 03:06 PM] Me: so does that mean 14?
[11/20/2005 03:07 PM] Me: no because the bitch still doesn't work
[11/20/2005 03:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: &h14 represents 14 in hex?
[11/20/2005 03:07 PM] Me: time for planet source code
[11/20/2005 03:08 PM] Me: first damned result
[11/20/2005 03:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh dude 
[11/20/2005 03:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you get it? cause that function returns a valyue
[11/20/2005 03:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: value*

[11/20/2005 03:14 PM] Me: that's a popular library
[11/20/2005 03:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/20/2005 03:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok fuck java im going to do this along side you, see if i ca figure it out
[11/20/2005 03:15 PM] Me: damn this stupid thing doesn't work
[11/20/2005 03:16 PM] Me: that's such a standard library

[11/20/2005 03:18 PM] Me: download and run
[11/20/2005 03:18 PM] Me: maybe i am missing libraries, seems like a pretty hard thing to lose though
[11/20/2005 03:19 PM] Me: considering there are thousands of them with millions of lines each
[11/20/2005 03:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol yeah ok hold on let met try and get this to wrok

[11/20/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: same one you gave me
[11/20/2005 03:23 PM] Me: 2002 or 2003?
[11/20/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: 03
[11/20/2005 03:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh and change the file name
[11/20/2005 03:23 PM] Me: i got an oh fuck
[11/20/2005 03:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you change the image name?
[11/20/2005 03:24 PM] Me: still oh fuck
[11/20/2005 03:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wow ur machine is fucked
[11/20/2005 03:24 PM] Me: where did you put the      BOOL SystemParametersInfo(

[11/20/2005 03:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you have an image in ur C: dir
[11/20/2005 03:25 PM] Me: yes

[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wtf
[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Me: no i mean the API call BOOL SystemParametersInfo
[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Me: where did you put that?
[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Me: under public?
[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it doesnt need to be declared
[11/20/2005 03:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just called
[11/20/2005 03:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: do you have a onBNClicked for a button you made?
[11/20/2005 03:27 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 03:27 PM] Me: i still get an oh fuck
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Me: maybe i should restart maybe my other program interfered with it
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: BOOL worked = SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER , 0, "C:\\test.bmp", SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE);
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: try it
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Me: maybe its the BMP
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: make sure its a bmp and not a jpg
[11/20/2005 03:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just to try 
[11/20/2005 03:29 PM] Me: worked
[11/20/2005 03:29 PM] Me: it was the bmp
[11/20/2005 03:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: there we go
  
[11/20/2005 03:29 PM] Me: ok so now drawing and image generation?
[11/20/2005 03:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao have fun, i have homework to get done, i'll start looking into that later
[11/20/2005 03:30 PM] Me: hmmm i could always make an activex out of my image generator and pass a few variable and de-initialize it when its finished
[11/20/2005 03:30 PM] Me: but wait what do i have to kill at the end of that sub?
[11/20/2005 03:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: of what sub?
[11/20/2005 03:31 PM] Me: the button click
[11/20/2005 03:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nothing its good to go
[11/20/2005 03:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: all vars that are not user allocated are destroyed the by destructor when theprogram closes
[11/20/2005 03:32 PM] Me: 3.8mgs
[11/20/2005 03:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that program?
[11/20/2005 03:33 PM] Me: but it still grows every time the button is clicked
[11/20/2005 03:33 PM] Me: 16KBs
[11/20/2005 03:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: man i'll have to look at it later
[11/20/2005 03:35 PM] Me: hmmm

[11/20/2005 05:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what are you talking about call off the convesion
[11/20/2005 05:13 PM] Me: we don't need to convert it
[11/20/2005 05:13 PM] Me: it'll be ok
[11/20/2005 05:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: convert what
[11/20/2005 05:13 PM] Me: and converting it to C++ will take forever
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Me: the desktop program
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so it works
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: in basic
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whatd you do
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Me: it levels out
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Me: kinda
[11/20/2005 05:14 PM] Me: it levels out at 19.5 kbs
[11/20/2005 05:15 PM] Me: C++ will take forever to do
[11/20/2005 05:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yup
[11/20/2005 05:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: did you get it to free up that memory?
[11/20/2005 05:16 PM] Me: well, it just levels out
[11/20/2005 05:16 PM] Me: it only frees it when it closes
[11/20/2005 05:16 PM] Me: but it doesn't constantly grow
[11/20/2005 05:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so why cant we release that mem while its runing
[11/20/2005 05:16 PM] Me: not sure
[11/20/2005 05:17 PM] Me: well after making the picture it releases ok
[11/20/2005 05:17 PM] Me: you will notice that it goes up to 30mgs then back to 20
[11/20/2005 05:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[11/20/2005 05:18 PM] Me: but that's normal
[11/20/2005 05:18 PM] Me: because it have a lot of drawing to do
[11/20/2005 05:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[11/20/2005 05:20 PM] Me: i really don't want to deal with sizing options
[11/20/2005 05:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Me: what?
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ?
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Me: i really don't want to deal with sizing options
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats fine
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i wouldnt 
[11/20/2005 05:21 PM] Me: hmmm
[11/20/2005 05:22 PM] Me: it will require users to have backgrounds in screen size
[11/20/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah fuck that
[11/20/2005 05:22 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[11/20/2005 05:22 PM] Me: no sizing options/
[11/20/2005 05:22 PM] Me: ?
[11/20/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol if you wanna deal with that then go for it, but thats a lot of work
[11/20/2005 05:23 PM] Me: yeah
[11/20/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or extra work
[11/20/2005 05:24 PM] Me: yay tool tips!
[11/20/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 06:20 PM] Me: dude i added more options
[11/20/2005 06:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nice
[11/20/2005 06:21 PM] Me: now you can set 2 time events with an operator in between either AND or OR
[11/20/2005 06:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[11/20/2005 06:22 PM] Me: its awesome
[11/20/2005 06:22 PM] Me: its helpful during the day
[11/20/2005 06:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it is
[11/20/2005 06:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you have a new one to send me?
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: one with less memory usage??
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: please?
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Me: kinda
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Me: why so much usage for you/
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Me: ?
[11/20/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cause im running my java ide and its killer my ram, and i had trouble running both of them last time

[11/20/2005 06:26 PM] Me: delete any events your have ahead of time or just delete the events.txt file
[11/20/2005 06:26 PM] Me: no more working on that
[11/20/2005 06:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[11/20/2005 06:27 PM] Me: the mem usage is a little lower
[11/20/2005 06:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: mine at 57 dude

[11/20/2005 06:55 PM] Me: then i will ask him if he has a picture set in advanced options
[11/20/2005 06:55 PM] Me: and then he will say how do i do that
[11/20/2005 06:55 PM] Me: or wtf?

[11/20/2005 06:56 PM] Me: well leave it on for the rest of the day and tell me if it grows to extreme proportions
[11/20/2005 06:57 PM] Me: i think it might grow 48k
[11/20/2005 06:57 PM] Me: i will have to look into fixing, i am not sure that it will level out
[11/20/2005 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol well i'll  keep my eye on it then
[11/20/2005 07:23 PM] Me: ok now everytime it creates the image it only increases by 8 instead of 48
[11/20/2005 07:23 PM] Me: and that might level out too

[12/01/2005 03:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: give me colors and layouts first
[12/01/2005 03:59 PM] Me: k
[12/01/2005 03:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and i kinda have a logo 
[12/01/2005 04:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its not done yet
[12/01/2005 04:00 PM] Me: ok i was gonna make a tab control completely out of CSS
[12/01/2005 04:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[12/01/2005 04:00 PM] Me: yeah
[12/01/2005 04:01 PM] Me: i think it would be awesome and totally creamable
[12/01/2005 04:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao the colors i use in the logo are white and the painters primaries
[12/01/2005 04:01 PM] Me: dude that's exactly what i was thinking
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: omfg sweet
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Me: but with fancy hover overs with little icons horizontally across the top for each section
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i want the site to be professional, sharp, and memorable
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Me: then the tabbed pages for every link
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh that sounds so sick
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Me: it will be all vertical and horizontal with only a few angles
[12/01/2005 04:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: perfect
[12/01/2005 04:03 PM] Me: like the heading will flow into the navigation on the left with an angled corner
[12/01/2005 04:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok stay away from curves
[12/01/2005 04:04 PM] Me: yeah definitely
[12/01/2005 04:26 PM] Me: this is hard
[12/01/2005 04:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol dont give up
[12/01/2005 04:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im working on a php picture gallery, should be fun
[12/01/2005 04:26 PM] Me: how can i change another elements properties if it isn't a child?
[12/01/2005 04:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i dont think you can, parents cant be changed
[12/01/2005 04:28 PM] Me: y not?
[12/01/2005 04:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cause things are derived from parents, and you cant change the parent without changed all child objects too
[12/01/2005 04:30 PM] Me: ok i think i have another id
[12/01/2005 04:30 PM] Me: ea
[12/01/2005 04:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/01/2005 04:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: does not in php is != or !== ??
[12/01/2005 04:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you can use both right?
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Me: i only use == PHP doesn't have types
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Me: kinda
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Me: ok it does
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Me: nvm that was dum
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so !== false is safe
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or safer? lol
[12/01/2005 04:33 PM] Me: for false just use !=
[12/01/2005 04:35 PM] Me: it its like mystr = "0" versus myint = 0 then (mystr != myint) = false but (mystr !== myint) = true
[12/01/2005 04:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wow thats werid
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Me: so ("false" != false) = false but ("false" !== false) = true
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Me: its the same in C++
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Me: isn't it?
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Dan Fairaizl: c++ doesnt use !==
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nor does java
[12/01/2005 04:36 PM] Me: BUT if (mystr = myint) always returns true because 1 equal sign means set the variable
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i know that
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Me: ok
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Me: its different in vb
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh ok
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Me: 1 = can be used in an if
[12/01/2005 04:37 PM] Me: that always messes me up when i am programming other languages
[12/01/2005 04:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that doesnt make since cause an if will always return a boolean value
[12/01/2005 04:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but i guess not
[12/01/2005 04:39 PM] Me: yeah vb is more basic
[12/01/2005 04:39 PM] Me: less logic
[12/01/2005 04:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol that sucks
[12/01/2005 04:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i wish it was easier to run php locally but i dont feel like setting all that crap up
[12/01/2005 04:40 PM] Me: dude you should its so nice
[12/01/2005 04:41 PM] Me: omfg its so nice
[12/01/2005 04:41 PM] Me: i would not be as productive as i am today if i had to upload every time
[12/01/2005 04:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah no kidding
[12/01/2005 04:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: maybe i'll do that this weekend
[12/01/2005 04:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats a big project 
[12/01/2005 04:51 PM] Me: the hardest part about this is i want it to not have to reload the page when a tab is clicked
[12/01/2005 04:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[12/01/2005 04:52 PM] Me: so hard
[12/01/2005 04:54 PM] Me: 5.7 Adjacent sibling selectors 
  
 Adjacent sibling selectors have the following syntax: E1 + E2, where E2 is the subject of the selector. The selector matches if E1 and E2 share the same parent in the document tree and E1 immediately precedes E2. 
  
 In some contexts, adjacent elements generate formatting objects whose presentation is handled automatically (e.g., collapsing vertical margins between adjacent boxes). The "+" selector allows authors to specify additional style to adjacent elements. 
  
 Example(s): 
  
 Thus, the following rule states that when a P element immediately follows a MATH element, it should not be indented: 
  
 MATH + P { text-indent: 0 }  
  
 The next example reduces the vertical space separating an H1 and an H2 that immediately follows it: 
  
 H1 + H2 { margin-top: -5mm }    
  
 Example(s): 
  
 The following rule is similar to the one in the previous example, except that it adds an attribute selector. Thus, special formatting only occurs when H1 has class="opener": 
  
 H1.opener + H2 { margin-top: -5mm }    
  
 
[12/01/2005 04:54 PM] Me: sweet
[12/01/2005 04:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i didnt know you could add stuff like that
[12/01/2005 04:55 PM] Me: i thinks that's it
[12/01/2005 04:55 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html)http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html
[12/01/2005 04:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[12/01/2005 04:56 PM] Me: FUCK YEAH
[12/01/2005 04:56 PM] Me: got it

[12/01/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: does it use frames? i hope not
[12/01/2005 05:22 PM] Me: no frames
[12/01/2005 05:22 PM] Me: only a table
[12/01/2005 05:22 PM] Me: and a subtable
[12/01/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: right on dude
[12/01/2005 05:23 PM] Me: so its like something that could be done in javascript a hell of a lot easier
[12/01/2005 05:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no kidding lol
[12/01/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: java sucks
[12/01/2005 05:24 PM] Me: doesn't work in IE
[12/01/2005 05:24 PM] Me: oh boy
[12/01/2005 05:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: crap ur right
[12/01/2005 05:30 PM] Me: wow have you ever used pseudo elements?
[12/01/2005 05:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: nope
[12/01/2005 05:32 PM] Me: they're amazing
[12/01/2005 05:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok im going to get something to eat bb in a few
[12/01/2005 05:36 PM] Me: damnit sibling support for IE isn't out until IE 7
[12/01/2005 05:36 PM] *** Auto-response from Dan Fairaizl: "Dave's not here man..."
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha owned
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Me: well since this is the key element i am giving up
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Me: there isn't really any other way to do it because IE is such a bitch
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh well
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yup
[12/01/2005 05:49 PM] Me: A:hover DIV doesn't work either
[12/01/2005 05:50 PM] Me: works fine in mozilla
[12/01/2005 05:50 PM] Me: how about inline frames?
[12/01/2005 05:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: inlines work in ie
[12/01/2005 05:51 PM] Me: yeah like the only thing

[12/01/2005 05:57 PM] Me: ok imagine a tree with <A>tab page<div>tab page content</div></a>
[12/01/2005 05:57 PM] Me: so A:hover DIV doesn't work
[12/01/2005 05:57 PM] Me: the only thing that works is A:hover *

[12/01/2005 07:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its good!
[12/01/2005 07:49 PM] Me: so tabbed.php is the page
[12/01/2005 07:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no its not
[12/01/2005 07:49 PM] Me: hmm?
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Me: it went back to 403?
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: there it goes!!!
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: got it!!
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Me: wtf?
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Me: nothing changed over here
[12/01/2005 07:50 PM] Me: how do you like it?
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that was weird, when i clicked the link it inserted the url twice
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Me: oh
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Me: much be trillian it doesn't know how to manage links
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Me: anywho what do you think?
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol ah hah
[12/01/2005 07:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok but anyways yeah it looks so hot
[12/01/2005 07:52 PM] Me: its not the easiest thing to set up, you have to specify all the pictures manually
[12/01/2005 07:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/01/2005 07:52 PM] Me: but it should load fast enough
[12/01/2005 07:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it should load faster than using frames
[12/01/2005 07:56 PM] Me: and so i was thinking that but then have each tab a different color and kind of theme the page
[12/01/2005 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: exactly 
[12/01/2005 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: each page as its own colors
[12/01/2005 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or theme
[12/01/2005 07:57 PM] Me: yeah
[12/01/2005 07:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd look so hot
[12/01/2005 07:57 PM] Me: and that will be easy to do just specify in the link to the CSS what color on each page and use PHP.CSS
[12/01/2005 07:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah just have a bigass css doc and import it into each page
[12/01/2005 08:04 PM] Me: only one problem, usually i use a header.php file for everything up to the content part of the page then a footer.php, but the link to the CSS has to be in the header so there isn't really any way to call it
[12/01/2005 08:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you cant call it in both header and footer?
[12/01/2005 08:05 PM] Me: well each page calls the header and footer itself
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmmm
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Me: i guess i could use http variable embeded in the page itself
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so its called by the page and header&footer
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Me: if which case there would be any way for people to change it in the regular address
[12/01/2005 08:06 PM] Me: that will work
[12/01/2005 08:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah people that i know dont go changing the http vars
[12/01/2005 08:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be weird lol
[12/01/2005 08:07 PM] Me: yeah but sometimes hotlinkers like me do
[12/01/2005 08:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol

[12/01/2005 08:10 PM] Me: that took a lot of scripting
[12/01/2005 08:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol no kidding
[12/01/2005 08:24 PM] Me: do you like no select scripts?
[12/01/2005 08:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: are you going to use one?
[12/01/2005 08:25 PM] Me: if you select inside the DIV with the different pages then it scrolls
[12/01/2005 08:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmm
[12/01/2005 08:35 PM] Me: i never got that logo

[12/01/2005 08:50 PM] Me: do you have to add mysql to the config file of apache?
[12/01/2005 08:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no idea, i have a program that installs and configs everything
[12/01/2005 08:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i cheated too

[12/01/2005 08:58 PM] Me: the other server just filtered it out because of a lower error setting
[12/01/2005 09:00 PM] Me: i don't think php 4.1 supports mysql 5
[12/01/2005 09:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i have php 5.1.1
[12/01/2005 09:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you use php arrays? im having a weird problem?
[12/01/2005 09:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the first 2 spots in the array are . and .. then it has the rest of the items
[12/01/2005 09:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: are the periods default values?
[12/01/2005 09:06 PM] Me: in an array?

[12/01/2005 09:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: :-P
[12/01/2005 09:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i get so confused, in C++ you have to account for a null terminator at the end of every kind of array, and in java/php/whatever you dont
[12/01/2005 09:15 PM] Me: fuck which PHP did you download?
[12/01/2005 09:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i have 5.1.1 that came in this bundle thing

[12/01/2005 09:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[12/01/2005 09:52 PM] Me: surprisingly the SQL server was working all along, it was the PHP was incompatible with the new mySQL

[12/02/2005 04:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats cool
[12/02/2005 04:05 PM] Me: but you have the 1 legal copy, so future pirated copies are ok sorta, you're a paying customer
[12/02/2005 04:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[12/02/2005 04:06 PM] Me: just like i have the one legal copy of visual studio so its ok for me to pirate 2005 pro and enterprise architect when it comes out
[12/02/2005 04:07 PM] Me: have you looked at the new one? its amazing the layout is so different
[12/02/2005 04:07 PM] Me: and office 2006 is amazing too its also really different

[12/02/2005 04:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[12/02/2005 04:12 PM] Me: i wish deamon tools supported CD writing then you could just use it to make iso images instead of just mounting them
[12/02/2005 04:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be cool
[12/02/2005 04:12 PM] Me: i thought so
[12/02/2005 04:14 PM] Me: i can't wait until blueray, maybe i just won't use a hard drive, i'll switch to knoppix and put everything of DVDs

[12/03/2005 01:27 PM] Me: unless you turn on option explicit then it lets you know
[12/03/2005 01:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/03/2005 01:27 PM] Me: and you have to use Ctype(from variable, to type)

[12/07/2005 10:51 AM] Dan Fairaizl: holy shit
[12/07/2005 10:53 AM] Me: so my library is browsable by artist album, and when an album is selected the PSP recognized the download as an XML file and adds it to the RSS feeds list, so i can then go over to feeds and play any of the song from that album without actually downloading them
[12/07/2005 10:53 AM] Me: i can make custom RSS lists too
[12/07/2005 10:53 AM] Dan Fairaizl: omfg let me in on this
[12/07/2005 10:54 AM] Me: so if you use my website or set up your own server you can do it to with all your music

[12/07/2005 06:45 PM] Me: a very acceptable replacements for the regular browser but it doesn't actually replace anything it just runs off the card
[12/07/2005 06:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh wow thats good
[12/07/2005 06:45 PM] Me: ok couple things

[12/07/2005 06:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok 
[12/07/2005 06:47 PM] Me: we will make our do more, listen to the community, and beautifully blend custom GUI with existing windows GUI
[12/07/2005 06:47 PM] Me: unlike those whores that just went completely different
[12/07/2005 06:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so you wanna skin the program as well as add the best functionality?
[12/07/2005 06:48 PM] Me: next, let us take full advantage of what the PSP does offer instead of hacking it
[12/07/2005 06:48 PM] Me: Online database to take full advantage of RSS and provide other users with it.  Basically just a list of files that outputs the correct RSS format.  Users can manage their different RSS feeds, and even open them easily through the PSP
[12/07/2005 06:48 PM] Me: not completely skin
[12/07/2005 06:48 PM] Me: maybe use similar styles with the flashy buttons
[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Me: anywho the second task is more important

[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Me: that project will go fast
[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you want users to be able to use to access their own stuff on their psp
[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: off of their machine (or others)
[12/07/2005 06:49 PM] Me: yeah
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Me: off their machines or others or their own websites
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: perfect
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Me: just make it easy for them to use RSS so they don't have to stay awake all night making it like i did
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so the program should have its own dir to store stuff so that the psp can access it
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol 
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Me: yes perfect
[12/07/2005 06:50 PM] Me: they can upload
[12/07/2005 06:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so we want the program to be able to broadbast files over a network, to the psp
[12/07/2005 06:51 PM] Me: yes uploading with PHP isn't hard
[12/07/2005 06:52 PM] Me: and the XML will take care of file management
[12/07/2005 06:52 PM] Me: all we have to do is worry about GUI and storing the file lists
[12/07/2005 06:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so what about actually making the files accessable over the wireless
[12/07/2005 06:52 PM] Me: yeah some will
[12/07/2005 06:52 PM] Me: like the ones users upload
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so we assume that a website will always be suppling the resources
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Me: eh yeah
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Me: its gonna be hard on my comp
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that cannot easily work locally
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Me: but i will get a server
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[12/07/2005 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: like the psp cant get files from C:/music
[12/07/2005 06:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: only http://mucis
[12/07/2005 06:54 PM] Me: nah converting addresses is easy to
[12/07/2005 06:54 PM] Me: i am more concerned about the SQL
[12/07/2005 06:54 PM] Me: and user management
[12/07/2005 06:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sql i can do
[12/07/2005 06:55 PM] Me: GUI and file management i can do
[12/07/2005 06:56 PM] Me: so we will have to work out exactly what kind of structure we want for the PSP
[12/07/2005 06:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/07/2005 06:57 PM] Me: just kind of general and not specific but for example
 Users
 --->Group
 ------>File List
 --->Group
 ------>File List
[12/07/2005 06:57 PM] Me: not too complex
[12/07/2005 06:57 PM] Me: not like forums
[12/07/2005 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok yeah i understand 
[12/07/2005 06:59 PM] Me: but obviously i don't know anything about password and user accounts and settings and extra elements like description of the file and dates and titles and actual locations and same for groups, all of which are required by the RSS
[12/07/2005 06:59 PM] Me: so i guess we will have to format it more like
  Users
  --->Group
  ------>File List
  --->Group
  ------>File List
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Me: oops
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Me: nvm
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Me: you can figure it out
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol no i see though
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Me: i'll work on implementing it
[12/07/2005 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so basic cant get the file info?
[12/07/2005 07:01 PM] Me: vb?
[12/07/2005 07:01 PM] Me: what?
[12/07/2005 07:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: can vb get all the info that is required for the RSS?
[12/07/2005 07:01 PM] Me: oh uhh most of it will be user specified, but we will have to use all PHP unless we want to make client software
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Me: EVENTUALLY we can implement it into the media manager, but i think we should just focus on the RSS online
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ohh i was under the impression that we have software
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so you wanna do this all webbased
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Me: yeah
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that clarifies a lot of stuff
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Me: PHP and SQL
[12/07/2005 07:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so yeah gui is gunna be much easier then lol
[12/07/2005 07:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[12/07/2005 07:03 PM] Me: then if we get to the manager we can add a section that stupid sony doesn't have and that's an RSS manager
[12/07/2005 07:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ohhh shiiit
[12/07/2005 07:04 PM] Me: what?
[12/07/2005 07:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: two people going up against Sony lol thats gunna be badass
[12/07/2005 07:05 PM] Me: lol
[12/07/2005 07:05 PM] Me: we have the entire developers community supporting us
[12/07/2005 07:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: true

[12/07/2005 07:06 PM] Me: and bring a lot of attention to my server
[12/07/2005 07:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ouch lol
[12/07/2005 07:06 PM] Me: i think if we just keep plugging away at it, eventually we will come out with a great product
[12/07/2005 07:09 PM] Me: time for me to go eat
[12/07/2005 07:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man

[12/08/2005 05:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: seems ok
[12/08/2005 05:19 PM] Me: i would just make one half of the start menu permenant and put it on the side as navigation
[12/08/2005 05:20 PM] Me: we could even make the desktop customizable
[12/08/2005 05:20 PM] Me: but that would be the only benefits of having the window minimize
[12/08/2005 05:21 PM] Me: is accessability, because i can't render new windows
[12/08/2005 05:21 PM] Me: it doesn't support .innerHTML in javascript only document.write and only on page load
[12/08/2005 05:21 PM] Me: so we will have to PHP each individual page
[12/08/2005 05:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/08/2005 05:22 PM] Me: anywho i will keep working i'm going to divide up my current design and stick in the variable hyperlinks so it doesn't have to be completely different

[12/08/2005 05:42 PM] Me: then the desktop will also be customizable, but somethings will be permentant like control panel and home
[12/08/2005 05:42 PM] Me: its perfect

[12/09/2005 10:55 AM] Me: (Link: http://pspxp.mine.nu/home.php)http://pspxp.mine.nu/home.php
[12/09/2005 10:56 AM] Me: i worked on picking out icons and making them work on the desktop, if i can get everything to use arrays, can you get the sql working?
[12/09/2005 11:17 AM] Dan Fairaizl: sorry dude i was in the shower
[12/09/2005 11:18 AM] Dan Fairaizl: what you need with sql?
[12/09/2005 11:20 AM] Dan Fairaizl: this is becoming fucking awesome
[12/09/2005 11:20 AM] Dan Fairaizl: theres something weird going on with the hover text
[12/09/2005 11:20 AM] Dan Fairaizl: everything else works
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Me: the hover text?
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Me: the blue background?
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah over the icons
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: on the desktop
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it looks like the text is there twice, one behind the other
[12/09/2005 01:07 PM] Me: yeah the PSP does that automatically no matter what CSS i use
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Me: yes it is to create the shadow
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that blows
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Me: and when you hover over it is makes it suck more
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol oh wel
[12/09/2005 01:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its looking great man
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Me: so we could use that style interface for the site
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol thatd be fun
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so what sql needs to be done?
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Me: you log in and can change all your preferences through that
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok you we need a user database, with a bunch of fields
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Me: and signing up for an account will be style like the windows installation
[12/09/2005 01:09 PM] Me: yeah
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Me: i figure a new table for each set of options
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: username, password, number of Icons?, startmenu icons?
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Me: general options will be in a table
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: desktop picute?
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Me: then desktop settings will be in another table
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Me: the list of start menu icons will be in another
[12/09/2005 01:10 PM] Me: and every user will be in each table
[12/09/2005 01:11 PM] Me: will that be possible?
[12/09/2005 01:11 PM] Me: can you have a table with columns or rows that are different like User 1 column has 20 rows, User 2 column has 30?
[12/09/2005 01:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmm lets see here
[12/09/2005 01:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: rows and cols will be 2D
[12/09/2005 01:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so i not sure about that
[12/09/2005 01:12 PM] Me: ok
[12/09/2005 01:12 PM] Me: then how about array elements?
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Me: we have the columns for each settings and each row is a user
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah so like each entry into the database, will be like field1 - username, field2 - password, field3 - icons
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and perhaps each field can store an array 
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i'll have to look
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Me: ok yeah same as your original scheme
[12/09/2005 01:13 PM] Me: that will work
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Me: yeah it can store arrays
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok then that will be good then
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Me: otherwise we will just explode it into a string and implode it back when it is read
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it will need to be parsed each time
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lets not do that yet
[12/09/2005 01:14 PM] Me: but these are going to be pretty complicated arrays, like 2D arrays
[12/09/2005 01:15 PM] Me: because i need multiple settings for each desktop icon, Icon, Href, and Text
[12/09/2005 01:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: how so.. we just strore the value of what each thing is in ther and according to what it is, download it
[12/09/2005 01:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so we make desktop, icon, hrefs, all fields with arrays
[12/09/2005 01:17 PM] Me: the way it is set up now is
 $icon[0][0]="Home"
 $icon[0][1]="graphics/home.jpg"
 $icon[0][2]="home.php"
[12/09/2005 01:17 PM] Me: is there a better way to do that?
[12/09/2005 01:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lets see here, one road we can go down is limiting the user to what they can use, like different packages of stuff to fit their needs
[12/09/2005 01:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: otherwise yeah we will need to use a 2D array for everything, and thats gunna get complex
[12/09/2005 01:19 PM] Me: yes i thought about that too
[12/09/2005 01:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it would be easier to do packages
[12/09/2005 01:19 PM] Me: it will be easy however if mySQL supports 2D arrays as a type
[12/09/2005 01:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: does it?
[12/09/2005 01:20 PM] Me: then we just explode the 2D arrays and use a 1D array to hold them
[12/09/2005 01:20 PM] Me: each different item
[12/09/2005 01:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh good lord that makes my head hurt
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Me: why?
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Me: imploding and exploding with PHP is easy
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you want an array of 2d arrays?
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Me: no cancel that
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Me: a 1D array containing a string
[12/09/2005 01:22 PM] Me: however after it is read from SQL the string is exploded into an array
[12/09/2005 01:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that is much better
[12/09/2005 01:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so whatever each string is, we can load a bunch of different options to corrispond
[12/09/2005 01:24 PM] Me: however since it doesn't look like it supports arrays we will just have to explode it with different characters
[12/09/2005 01:24 PM] Me: (Link: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/set.html)http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/set.html
[12/09/2005 01:25 PM] Me: no that looks like it can only do any of those letters not any letter and any amount
[12/09/2005 01:25 PM] Me: that makes my head hurt don't think about that last statement
[12/09/2005 01:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[12/09/2005 01:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/09/2005 01:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it doesnt look like sql can store an array
[12/09/2005 01:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok man heres how this is gunna have to happen
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: each users gets their own table
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Me: ok then it can be exploded twice into a string?
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Me: are you sure?
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Me: that's not the way forums work and that's much more complicated
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that the way that makes since to me
[12/09/2005 01:30 PM] Me: the tables will be tiny but continue
[12/09/2005 01:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and then just load each each field in the table in a sequential order
[12/09/2005 01:31 PM] Me: ok ok
[12/09/2005 01:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: will that work?
[12/09/2005 01:31 PM] Me: so we have 3 columns in each row
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Me: first row is the first 3 general options
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Me: next row is the second 3 general options
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Me: then we have a list of desktop icon settings
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Me: then followed by start menu settings
[12/09/2005 01:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but we are going to have to limit the amount of stuff they can use
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Me: then rss feed settings
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: like you can have 5 desktop icons, so we can set 5 fields and jsut take the ones that have something in them
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Me: dude that's way to inefficient
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Me: i'd rather explode into strings
[12/09/2005 01:33 PM] Me: because what about RSS groups
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Me: i want you to be able to set up 5 RSS feeds all different lists
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Me: remember you can refer to SQL elements by name too
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok but what im saying is that its gunna be hard to add more fields into each users database
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: there needs to be some structure
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Me: yeah
[12/09/2005 01:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: this thing cant dynamically grow
[12/09/2005 01:35 PM] Me: let me look around in this PHP forums code
[12/09/2005 01:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok now i have a final to take, so i'll bbl
[12/09/2005 01:35 PM] Me: talk to you then
[12/09/2005 01:35 PM] Me: good luck
[12/09/2005 01:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thanks
[12/09/2005 01:55 PM] Me: yeah lets just use explodes and treat everything like options
[12/09/2005 01:55 PM] *** Auto-response from Dan Fairaizl: final time :-(
[12/09/2005 01:55 PM] Me: explodes aren't to hard on the processor
[12/09/2005 01:55 PM] Me: but we will still limit it
[12/09/2005 02:23 PM] Me: this is what i am thinking
[12/09/2005 02:23 PM] Me: SELECT Usersettings FROM usertable WHERE userid = idwewant 
  
 SELECT Desktoplist FROM iconstable WHERE userid = idwewant 
 ## Explode the desktoplist twice 
  
 SELECT Startmenu  FROM iconstable WHERE userid = idwewant 
  
 SELECT RssFeeds1, RssFeeds2, RssFeeds3, RssFeeds4  FROM FeedsTable  WHERE userid = idwewant 
  
 SELECT Uploads FROM Uploadtable WHERE userid = idwewant 
 ## To obtain all files, so user specific diractories don't have to be created, prefixes will be used 
  
 user specific tables won't be needed using the explode functions in PHP, the three settings for each 
 icon or start menu item will be converted to escape characters then explode() with ":" 
 between the three elements, then each icon will be compiled into a string with explode() using 
 seperator ";" when the table is read they will be converted back.

[12/09/2005 09:58 PM] Me: i mean for each user
[12/09/2005 09:58 PM] Me: how much space should we give them?
[12/09/2005 09:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: well depending on what and how we manage software downloads, meaning if all of our software is all zipped up and nice, then space can still be fairly small
[12/09/2005 10:00 PM] Me: wait what?
[12/09/2005 10:00 PM] Me: i was talking about for uploads to the pspxp

[12/09/2005 10:03 PM] Me: everyone will have their own music files, but they will also be able to link to other
[12/09/2005 10:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: plus im not too comfortable using non-legal mp3's as public domain stuff
[12/09/2005 10:04 PM] Me: what? you mean what is there now?

[12/09/2005 10:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok its intstalled
[12/09/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so how do we want this thing to be orginized

[12/09/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok i'll tell you what i need first
[12/09/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that sentence made no since...
[12/09/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: anyways database name
[12/09/2005 10:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: users?
[12/09/2005 10:39 PM] Me: database name is pspxp
[12/09/2005 10:39 PM] Me: and just an admin user
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Me: you can get the code to create database stuff right?
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: number of fields?
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yes
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Me: shit
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: create database 'pspxp' lol
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Me: uhhh first table maybe 5
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah we need to know this stuff, thats what i was talking about earlier
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its a bitch the change them...
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: name of this table?
[12/09/2005 10:40 PM] Me: not with PHP
[12/09/2005 10:41 PM] Me: users
[12/09/2005 10:41 PM] Me: or user_data
[12/09/2005 10:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: users
[12/09/2005 10:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok whats the first field?
[12/09/2005 10:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: name?
[12/09/2005 10:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh we also need a unique ID for each user i'll make that one first
[12/09/2005 10:43 PM] Me: oh yeah
[12/09/2005 10:43 PM] Me: how do we do that in PHP?
[12/09/2005 10:43 PM] Me: or does SQL do it automatically
[12/09/2005 10:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: a new table will have to be created each time a users signs up, that is done with sql, all php does is connect to the database
[12/09/2005 10:44 PM] Me: a new table?
[12/09/2005 10:44 PM] Me: not just a new row?
[12/09/2005 10:44 PM] Me: everyone is going to get a separate table?
[12/09/2005 10:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be much easier
[12/09/2005 10:45 PM] Me: no
[12/09/2005 10:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then we can breakdown the basics of the accounts and explode the strings
[12/09/2005 10:45 PM] Me: *sigh*
[12/09/2005 10:45 PM] Me: will the code i sent you earlier work?
[12/09/2005 10:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that code didnt make much since
[12/09/2005 10:46 PM] Me: i got it from the forums
[12/09/2005 10:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and neither are you! dammit all an sql database can do is tables, each table has fields that can hold ONE variable of a type
[12/09/2005 10:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: now what i assumed is that all the types are strings
[12/09/2005 10:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and we can parse the string and determine everything the user needs
[12/09/2005 10:47 PM] Me: ok ok go ahead and do your thing
[12/09/2005 10:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so what do you want in the fields, the first is a unique ID that increments with each user
[12/09/2005 10:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what next
[12/09/2005 10:48 PM] Me: yes
[12/09/2005 10:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that doesnt answer my question lol
[12/09/2005 10:48 PM] Me: then username, password
[12/09/2005 10:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and we can add more fields if necessary
[12/09/2005 10:48 PM] Me: ok
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Me: desktop background
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Me: i don't know anymore settings
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we limit the user name to 20 characters? or more
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Me: ok
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i'll do 20
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Me: ok
[12/09/2005 10:49 PM] Me: i don't know how to do that with html
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: do what
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Me: limit it
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Me: i could just return an error
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it can be done, i remember doing that at one point
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its easy 
[12/09/2005 10:50 PM] Me: i did it
[12/09/2005 10:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: php can check im sure, all the data from a form is stored in _$POST 
[12/09/2005 10:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: default username will be admin
[12/09/2005 10:51 PM] Me: max password length
[12/09/2005 10:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: 20? whatever you want
[12/09/2005 10:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: 12?
[12/09/2005 10:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whats stardard seems like 8-12
[12/09/2005 10:52 PM] Me: 12
[12/09/2005 10:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: max = 12 then
[12/09/2005 10:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: default password?
[12/09/2005 10:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i like hello

[12/09/2005 10:55 PM] Me: uhhhh longer
[12/09/2005 10:55 PM] Me: 128
[12/09/2005 10:55 PM] Me: no
[12/09/2005 10:55 PM] Me: 256 is standard kinda for variables
[12/09/2005 10:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: is that your final answer?
[12/09/2005 10:56 PM] Me: yes
[12/09/2005 10:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok

[12/09/2005 11:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: id rather do that, and just assume that the form being used askes for the basic information
[12/09/2005 11:20 PM] Me: work with the post data yeah

[12/10/2005 11:53 AM] Me: t
[12/10/2005 12:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but that code worked
[12/10/2005 12:26 PM] Me: mostly somewhat
[12/10/2005 12:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol it did exactly what it was supposed to, add info
[12/10/2005 12:27 PM] Me: it was the right format, but the php wasn't all right
[12/10/2005 12:27 PM] Me: you didn't use _POST right
[12/10/2005 12:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but it can be used like that
[12/10/2005 12:28 PM] Me: when getting from a form you have either use $inputname or the safer $_post["inputname"]
[12/10/2005 12:28 PM] Me: you have $_post[$inputname]

[12/10/2005 12:36 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thoes should never be the same

[12/10/2005 12:37 PM] Me: yup yup
[12/10/2005 12:38 PM] Me: should i put the IP address in the ssid?
[12/10/2005 12:39 PM] Me: nah no one will ever be able to guess someone else's session ID
[12/10/2005 12:39 PM] Me: and it is passed to every page
[12/10/2005 12:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah just do that for now
[12/10/2005 12:39 PM] Me: and the create table code at the bottom is the stuff you used right?
[12/10/2005 12:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah that created that whole database but dont do that again
[12/10/2005 12:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats just a map to see the fields
[12/10/2005 12:40 PM] Me: i dropped the table like 5 times over
[12/10/2005 12:40 PM] Me: when what are the real values?
[12/10/2005 12:40 PM] Me: shit
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what did you do
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Me: i might have to drop it again because isn't that create table code supposed to have max lengths?
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i said dont fuck with it lol
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Me: i dropped the table last night because i wanted to change the fields
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i added thoes after it was created
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Me: so what is the real code used to created the table?
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: PHPMYADMIN
[12/10/2005 12:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: get it!!
[12/10/2005 12:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it does this for you
[12/10/2005 12:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it shows you the database and everything good
[12/10/2005 12:42 PM] Me: ... don't you still have it?  i'd rather learn this shit not have something to it for me
[12/10/2005 12:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that code i used was exactly what created the database
[12/10/2005 12:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i can change the fields after creating it
[12/10/2005 12:43 PM] Me: what code did you use? the stuff at the bottom of the page you sent me?
[12/10/2005 12:43 PM] Me: because that's the code i used for this database
[12/10/2005 12:43 PM] Me: yours wasn't even working, it kept returning pspxp.users table doesn't exist
[12/10/2005 12:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then you didnt put the databas in the right spot
[12/10/2005 12:44 PM] Me: so after i dropped your table i recreated it with the code at the bottom of the page and it worked
[12/10/2005 12:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok so whats the porblem
[12/10/2005 12:44 PM] Me: i put pspxp into data with my other data bases
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Me: the problem is, is the code at the bottom of the page the right stuff
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Me: does it limit the length of characters or strings?
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: let me get that
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Me: is it supposed to?
[12/10/2005 12:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no
[12/10/2005 12:46 PM] Me: oh, then don't worry about it i'm sure everything is fine
[12/10/2005 12:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but do you want the code that creates everything?
[12/10/2005 12:46 PM] Me: CREATE TABLE `users` ( 
 `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , 
 `username` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 `password` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 `GUID` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 `lastlogon` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL , 
 `email` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 `bgpicture` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) 
 ) ENGINE = innodb; 
 
[12/10/2005 12:46 PM] Me: is that it?
[12/10/2005 12:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that creates all the fields
[12/10/2005 12:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: not the legnths 
[12/10/2005 12:47 PM] Me: oh
[12/10/2005 12:47 PM] Me: what controls the lengths?
[12/10/2005 12:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just a sec
[12/10/2005 12:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: howd it go? ID username password time picture email
[12/10/2005 12:48 PM] Me: CREATE TABLE `users` ( 
 `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , 
 `username` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 `password` TEXT NOT NULL ,

 `bgpicture` TEXT NOT NULL , 
 PRIMARY KEY ( `id` ) 
 ) ENGINE = innodb; 
 
[12/10/2005 12:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and did  you add more fields?
[12/10/2005 12:49 PM] Me: yes
[12/10/2005 12:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: are they above?
[12/10/2005 12:49 PM] Me: yes
[12/10/2005 12:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whats the length for GUID
[12/10/2005 12:51 PM] Me: 32
[12/10/2005 12:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok for text the length is built in, but for other datatypes it needs to be specified
[12/10/2005 12:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: otherwise the length goes after the tyep vchar(10) or something
[12/10/2005 12:54 PM] Me: so since all the fields i listed above are text i don't have to worry about it?
[12/10/2005 12:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yes
[12/10/2005 12:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just limit it in the form
[12/10/2005 12:55 PM] Me: and since it gave me a warning when i tried to use TIMESTAMP(14) i should worry about then either?
[12/10/2005 12:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: take out the 14 and see if it works
[12/10/2005 12:56 PM] Me: it did
[12/10/2005 12:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok then
[12/10/2005 12:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: your good to go
[12/10/2005 12:57 PM] Me: hey what about enum to control arrays
[12/10/2005 12:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i have like no experience with emumerated data structures
[12/10/2005 12:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: try it
[12/10/2005 12:58 PM] Me: i shall

[12/11/2005 02:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok that like exactly what i did with one
[12/11/2005 02:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah looks good
[12/11/2005 02:43 PM] Me: i guess i don't have illustrator
[12/11/2005 02:44 PM] Me: i thought i did
[12/11/2005 02:44 PM] Me: maybe it didn't come with my copy of cs2
[12/11/2005 02:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol that sucks yeah its a seperate program
[12/11/2005 02:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: a wonderful program
[12/11/2005 02:45 PM] Me: so if windows and other oses support 256 color
[12/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: then with alpha XP and OS X supports 4294967296 colors?
[12/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: theoretically
[12/11/2005 02:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats a really big number
[12/11/2005 02:46 PM] Me: i mean the alpha is just going to add to whatever is behind it
[12/11/2005 02:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/11/2005 02:47 PM] Me: but if there was nothing behind it say a monitor was translucent, then it could
[12/11/2005 02:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that be badass
[12/11/2005 02:50 PM] Me: what should the background be?
[12/11/2005 02:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: keep it simple
[12/11/2005 02:50 PM] Me: now that i have the translucency i can make one background for 1 control and it will sow up on all the pages
[12/11/2005 02:50 PM] Me: i mean for the program not the logo
[12/11/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: still keep it simple, some soft of pattern
[12/11/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sort*
[12/11/2005 02:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and soft lol
[12/11/2005 02:52 PM] Me: you know we can skin anything right
[12/11/2005 02:52 PM] Me: in VB there is api to turn off auto draw on controls and also api to control the drawing of controls
[12/11/2005 02:52 PM] Me: so we never have to use the windows stuff
[12/11/2005 02:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet, ok man i g2g for a bit ttyl

[12/17/2005 08:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i wonder if its gunna burn slowly
[12/17/2005 08:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats a lot of shit to fill up
[12/17/2005 08:54 PM] Me: yeah
[12/17/2005 08:54 PM] Me: of course it will burn slowly
[12/17/2005 08:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh well thats worth it
[12/17/2005 08:55 PM] Me: but there wasn't really a difference when DVDs became a popular burning solution to when CD burners became popular
[12/17/2005 08:55 PM] Me: it will suffice for the amount you are burning
[12/17/2005 08:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: exactly
[12/17/2005 08:56 PM] Me: wow HD-DVD
[12/17/2005 08:56 PM] Me: is a blueray competitor
[12/17/2005 08:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmmm
[12/17/2005 08:57 PM] Me: i don't know man with sony and their fucking DRM, HD-DVD with M$ backing it up almost looks like a better choice
[12/17/2005 08:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: fuckin MS
[12/17/2005 08:58 PM] Me: fuck sonys DRM
[12/17/2005 08:58 PM] Me: sony probably won't even release a burner for it years after it comes out just like they fucking did with DVDs
[12/17/2005 08:59 PM] Me: how long have DVDs been around?
[12/17/2005 08:59 PM] Me: and how long before you got your first DVD burner
[12/17/2005 08:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dvds have beeen around for a long time, dvd burners only a few years
[12/17/2005 08:59 PM] Me: so it will be the same deal with bluray especially with sony backing it
[12/17/2005 09:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah no dout but i think bluray will take better than HDDVD
[12/17/2005 09:01 PM] Me: yeah its been hipped up so much
[12/17/2005 09:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah there isnt a lot of info on hddvds
[12/17/2005 09:01 PM] Me: but look at ATI, they are obviously better than GeForce they just suck at advertising
[12/17/2005 09:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ati is better than nvidia in every way
[12/17/2005 09:02 PM] Me: ATI comes out on top of every benchmark, but you never hear about how awesome they are
[12/17/2005 09:02 PM] Me: its always well nVidia has dual DVI out

[01/08/2006 07:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was thinking that earlier today actually
[01/08/2006 07:41 PM] Me: we should work on the bitmap library in C
[01/08/2006 07:41 PM] Me: see if it has all the fuctionality
[01/08/2006 07:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it'll have a lot
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Me: you know there is an equation to calculate sin
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Me: its not even that complex
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Me: might be better to use that then the entire math library
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: tangent is more scarry
[01/08/2006 07:42 PM] Me: yeah i would imagine

[01/08/2006 07:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: look good
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Me: now we need some new backgrounds
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah most def
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Me: then once we get this entire collection of stuff we will slap it all into a setup CD and distribute it for like 5 bucks each
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: we should add a cool background selecter part of the program that allows you to see how each one looks with the different times in a preview window
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Me: and design a label
[01/08/2006 07:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yay
[01/08/2006 07:45 PM] Me: with different times?
[01/08/2006 07:45 PM] Me: oh boy

[01/08/2006 07:48 PM] Me: cool
[01/08/2006 07:48 PM] Me: i'll work on the preview window
[01/08/2006 07:48 PM] Me: shouldn't be too hard
[01/08/2006 07:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i dont think so either
[01/08/2006 07:50 PM] Me: we should try and finish this in the next week before you get into your classes
[01/08/2006 07:50 PM] Me: which is most important not this
[01/08/2006 07:51 PM] Me: but then i'll be able to prep it before school and slap on a CD label and we'll be good to go

[01/08/2006 07:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah as long as the app stays relitivly small there is no problem
[01/08/2006 07:54 PM] Me: i mean as far as taking up space on the CD with extra pictures
[01/08/2006 07:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: space on cds or HDDs

[01/08/2006 07:56 PM] Me: i could just set up a script to have fireworks render a shit load of different hues and saturations of it
[01/08/2006 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i think thats excessive... the color of that image cant be changed from inside the program...
[01/08/2006 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats weak
[01/08/2006 07:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: java can do that
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Me: we could rewrite it in java
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Me: in 4 days
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: LMFAO!!!!
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: NO
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Me: exactly
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i hate the JVM
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Me: i will try exploring the drawing engine more
[01/08/2006 07:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah see what it can do
[01/08/2006 07:58 PM] Me: i don't think it will work
[01/08/2006 07:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: see if you can take the raw data of the pixles fronm the image
[01/08/2006 07:58 PM] Me: i can
[01/08/2006 07:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then cant you just recompose the image with different color values...
[01/08/2006 07:58 PM] Me: but i don't want to go replacing every single one while its trying to draw
[01/08/2006 07:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so have it a setting that has to be done whenever you want to change it, and then it can just rewrite the previous one
[01/08/2006 07:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah dont do that when it draws every 10 minutes
[01/08/2006 07:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats a big ass loop
[01/08/2006 08:00 PM] Me: yeah
[01/08/2006 08:00 PM] Me: well not that big
[01/08/2006 08:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but long
[01/08/2006 08:00 PM] Me: because the image is just repeated
[01/08/2006 08:01 PM] Me: ahhh i'm running out of room to put options!
[01/08/2006 08:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: put that in the colors, and just make it a popup dialog
[01/08/2006 08:02 PM] Me: k
[01/08/2006 08:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im a huge fan of the popup
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Me: yeah i love the windows dialogs
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Me: they support everything in the .net frame work
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: :-D
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Me: its all possible to do in other languages you just have to use API calls
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Me: i've done it that way too, not too hard, but there are even printing and page layout dialogs support
[01/08/2006 08:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yup
[01/08/2006 08:04 PM] Me: and preview document dialogs
[01/08/2006 08:04 PM] Me: its awesome

[01/17/2006 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: have you talked to her about a relationship?
[01/17/2006 06:54 PM] Me: some days its really great and we're talking and its like we've been together forever, other days we just don't talk at all or it feels like it always has been, too many years apart like we barely know eachother now
[01/17/2006 06:54 PM] Me: we've briefly talked about it, but there wasn't a straight answer, she just kind of left me hanging
[01/17/2006 06:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok but shes coming out to pho town to visit you.. be happy!!
[01/17/2006 06:55 PM] Me: but on those good days its different, she tells me how much she wants to be with me
[01/17/2006 06:55 PM] Me: yeah but what if she comes out and we still aren't anything but friends
[01/17/2006 06:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: everyone has good days and bad days man
[01/17/2006 06:56 PM] Me: i mean friends is good too but one day she could decide to be with someone else and we would go without talking for years
[01/17/2006 06:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i think you'll be fine man
[01/17/2006 06:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just look at this in a positive way
[01/17/2006 06:58 PM] Me: yeah
[01/17/2006 06:58 PM] Me: i just really want to be with her
[01/17/2006 06:58 PM] Me: but i can't tell if she feels the same
[01/17/2006 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: then honestly i would ask her
[01/17/2006 06:59 PM] Me: yeah i want to but i think i should wait until we are together
[01/17/2006 06:59 PM] Me: what do you think?
[01/17/2006 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok this could go two ways, either ask her and see how she feels, which could be bad cause then she might feel hesitant to fly out
[01/17/2006 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or be happy and when she gets here 
[01/17/2006 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: get the truth
[01/17/2006 07:00 PM] Me: patience is a virtue i guess i should just wait and find out in person
[01/17/2006 07:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i think thatd be safer
[01/17/2006 07:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so howd you get her to come out and see you?
[01/17/2006 07:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: drugs, hypnosis?

[01/17/2006 07:09 PM] Me: usually our conversations are filled with that
[01/17/2006 07:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok see thats a good sign, you are over analyzing this a bit
[01/17/2006 07:10 PM] Me: and sometimes mild role playing like if i was there she would be with me all the time

[01/17/2006 07:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the mirror is almost impossible to see in
[01/17/2006 07:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha
[01/17/2006 07:12 PM] Me: so i want to get a screen door to attach to our door and replace the screen with blackout one way tint
[01/17/2006 07:12 PM] Me: it would be funny
[01/17/2006 07:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haah rock on
[01/17/2006 07:12 PM] Me: we could observe them but they would see us

[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Me: Amy isn't a virgin
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Me: maybe that's why she won't sleep with me
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Me: she doesn't want me to catch anything
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok see thats something i have a hard time dealing with
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao what
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Me: lol
[01/18/2006 08:43 PM] Me: no Amy is so amazing it doesn't matter
[01/18/2006 08:44 PM] Me: and her experience was a long time ago and because of peer pressure
[01/18/2006 08:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ouch... that brings back a lot of bad memories
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: why?
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: are you a virgin?
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that happened to Ashley
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: ah i c
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: is that why that didn't work out?
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and that can cause a lot of trouble
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah mostly
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: because it doesn't really bother me
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Me: that's weird
[01/18/2006 08:45 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah...
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Me: actually i would prefer the girl has a notch or two on he rbelt
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it was much worse with her tho
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Me: *her
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: haha

[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Me: first timers suck
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: "ouch it hurts"
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Me: lol yeah
[01/18/2006 08:46 PM] Me: i mean it really doesn't bother me just as long as anyone in the past was clean too
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: fucking shit man this online class im taking... yeah online my ass... the software it needs is 1.8 gigs
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah of course
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Me: oh this girl said the only guy shes been with was a virgin too and the used condoms religiously
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Me: thank god i'll be able to sleep tonight
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man 
[01/18/2006 08:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats good news
[01/18/2006 08:48 PM] Me: yeah
[01/18/2006 08:48 PM] Me: so what is this girl on hall counsel isn't a virgin?
[01/18/2006 08:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: not sure but i bet she is
[01/18/2006 08:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but again i dont know her that well
[01/18/2006 08:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: her name is Julianne by the way
[01/18/2006 08:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i failed to mention that
[01/18/2006 08:50 PM] Me: but would that seriously bother you still?
[01/18/2006 08:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it wouldnt bother me enough to stop seeing her
[01/18/2006 08:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its just something that i cant get out of my mind
[01/18/2006 08:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its stupid
[01/18/2006 08:51 PM] Me: yeah, but you'll figure it out
[01/18/2006 08:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no dout :-P
[01/18/2006 08:52 PM] Me: you'll realize that you like the person more then to care about who they have been with in the past, and it just comes down to whats happening at that moment whether it be intimate or not
[01/18/2006 08:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i think that could be a hallmark card...
[01/18/2006 08:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao but yeah thanks man
[01/18/2006 08:53 PM] Me: i seriously want to tell Amy this but i think it might come off as too strong so i'll probably tell her when she comes out, even if i shared a bed with her i wouldn't even think about touching her because just being around her is really what matters to me
[01/18/2006 08:53 PM] Me: and that says a lot considering i've had 3 one night stands since school started
[01/18/2006 08:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i only remember two...
[01/18/2006 08:54 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah dont tell her that until the time comes
[01/18/2006 08:54 PM] Me: but man that's how much i'm into her
[01/18/2006 08:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man and thats why you should stop over analysing this just look forward to seeing her again
[01/18/2006 08:55 PM] Me: like taking a completely intimate moment and discarding any sexual activity because the calm comfortability of being around her is all that matters to me
[01/18/2006 08:55 PM] Me: that's weird
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Me: i've never felt like that before
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Me: maybe i'm just going crazy
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its a weird feeling
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: welcome to the club :-P
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Me: but i wouldn't tell her because i don't think shed understand
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Me: because she doesn't know about my previous history of relationships
[01/18/2006 08:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you'll both know when the time comes
[01/18/2006 08:57 PM] Me: yeah
[01/18/2006 08:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: all that matters is whats happening at that moment, not anything of the past
[01/18/2006 08:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: :-P
[01/18/2006 08:57 PM] Me: yeah
[01/18/2006 08:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: where do you think i should take Julie?
[01/18/2006 08:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was thinking tgi fridays
[01/18/2006 08:58 PM] Me: i don't mean to over analyze shit it just happens, and its not just in relationships its in everything
[01/18/2006 08:58 PM] Me: nah
[01/18/2006 08:58 PM] Me: someplace cultured

[01/18/2006 09:01 PM] Me: we know how each others personalities and we get along so well

[01/18/2006 09:01 PM] Me: dude am i the only fucking person in this world that understand the concept of a one night stand
[01/18/2006 09:01 PM] Me: ?

[01/18/2006 09:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao girls dont understand it
[01/18/2006 09:02 PM] Me: and again with the spending the night with someone that weighs more then me

[01/19/2006 08:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i told you
[01/19/2006 08:41 PM] Me: like about wanting to be close to me even in an intimate and all that matters is being together

[01/22/2006 09:09 PM] Me: i kinda want it is it free?
[01/22/2006 09:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im pretty sure its not free
[01/22/2006 09:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and its weird looking
[01/22/2006 09:09 PM] Me: really?
[01/22/2006 09:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: all i remember about it is this weird little animated guy dancing around the screen
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Me: ewww that's gross
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol yeah
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: it looked a lot like gnome for linux
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Me: its worse then the old Mac OS
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Me: now its worse then GNOME
[01/22/2006 09:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[01/22/2006 09:11 PM] Me: google needs to make a version of linux
[01/22/2006 09:11 PM] Me: that's beautiful
[01/22/2006 09:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah thatd just prove that google is trying to take over the world
[01/22/2006 09:12 PM] Me: and aesthetically pleasing 
[01/22/2006 09:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what is?
[01/22/2006 09:12 PM] Me: they should
[01/22/2006 09:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but yeah solaris just proves how java isnt really useful
[01/22/2006 09:15 PM] Me: lol
[01/22/2006 09:15 PM] Me: java sucks
[01/22/2006 09:15 PM] Me: you know its the microsystems compliment to .net framework
[01/22/2006 09:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sun?
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Me: because they wouldn't share and microsoft couldn't afford to buy them, they invented .net framework at the turn of the millinium
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Me: sry sun microsystems
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah ok
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: didnt know that
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Me: so it may be a little less bulky and cross platform but it still sucks
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol yeah
[01/22/2006 09:16 PM] Me: C++ is the only thing with true cross platform libraries
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Me: unless you get into the microsoft libraries
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but even then most cross platform stuff still leaves a lot to be desired
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Me: nah dude
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Me: not when you render graphics like video games
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah its all hardware tho
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Me: just render and engine like that but a regular interface like buttons that match the OS
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: if you need to interact with the os its all seperate
[01/22/2006 09:17 PM] Me: *an engine
[01/22/2006 09:18 PM] Me: yeah
[01/22/2006 09:18 PM] Me: that's why my idea is the best
[01/22/2006 09:18 PM] Me: the cross platform plain core with the interface cross platform compiled
[01/22/2006 09:18 PM] Me: now what is we had an IDE that did that for you
[01/22/2006 09:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but can that deal with all the high level stuff thats os specific?
[01/22/2006 09:19 PM] Me: it knew how to translate interfaces
[01/22/2006 09:19 PM] Me: that would be truly amazing
[01/22/2006 09:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah if that could happen
[01/22/2006 09:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: itd be badass
[01/22/2006 09:19 PM] Me: there isn't really that much in my weather desktop program that is OS specific and we could probably do it in C++
[01/22/2006 09:20 PM] Me: we just need to learn the bitmap.h library really really well
[01/22/2006 09:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dude its all the framework tho, thats ment to be MS specific
[01/22/2006 09:20 PM] Me: but the only stuff that's windows specific is the setting the actual picture to the desktop, and a few other commands
[01/22/2006 09:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it could be make in C++ pretty easily
[01/22/2006 09:21 PM] Me: but if we convert it to C++ on windows there is only a handful of commands that would need to be converted to OS specific
[01/22/2006 09:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah as long as the hardware support is there then i bet it could be ported
[01/22/2006 09:21 PM] Me: easily
[01/22/2006 09:21 PM] Me: C++ is cross platform
[01/22/2006 09:22 PM] Me: well i don't know is the linux bitmap library would be the same
[01/22/2006 09:22 PM] Me: but it should be
[01/22/2006 09:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that i dunno about
[01/22/2006 09:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: linux stuff is hard to use with anyting windows related
[01/22/2006 09:23 PM] Me: do i want the eclipse SDK 3.1?
[01/22/2006 09:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: linux does support bitmap and that kind of media but i have no idea how it makes it work, and if its the same as MS
[01/22/2006 09:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah 3.1
[01/22/2006 09:23 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its amazing
[01/22/2006 09:24 PM] Me: well is the libraries are the same then we can make it work
[01/22/2006 09:24 PM] Me: i have it installed i'll look it up
[01/22/2006 09:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol right on
[01/22/2006 09:25 PM] Me: i have all the tools and eclipse installed on my Vmware macine
[01/22/2006 09:25 PM] Me: *machine
[01/22/2006 09:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sweet
[01/22/2006 09:25 PM] Me: yeah i am downloading eclipse now
[01/22/2006 09:25 PM] Me: for windows
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its too bad eclipse is only for using the jvm
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Me: you could make your own compiler or steal microsofts and build your own ide if you want though
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Me: i bet its written in c++
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im sure it was
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Me: because they have both windows and linux versions
[01/22/2006 09:26 PM] Me: so it is possible
[01/22/2006 09:27 PM] Me: and the same with vmware
[01/22/2006 09:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: vmware is an insanely complex piece of software
[01/22/2006 09:30 PM] Me: yes it is
[01/22/2006 09:30 PM] Me: i love it

[01/22/2006 10:55 PM] Me: and it could actually move
[01/22/2006 10:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wtf...
[01/22/2006 10:59 PM] Me: they just need to put a laser on it and program it to kill cancer cells

[02/13/2006 07:30 PM] Me: have you ever been in such a predicament where you have committed to being focused on one girl, but then another girl comes along and suddenly your focus is destroyed and views of a relationship skewed?
[02/13/2006 07:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it happened when i came back down from break, i liked that one girl Blanca, and Juli came along and now shes my girlfriend lol
[02/13/2006 07:31 PM] Dan Fairaizl: its not always a bad thing
[02/13/2006 07:33 PM] Me: yeah so is it normal to feel slightly disappointed when you find out the new girl is not entirely available but involved with someone else, she was just to incredibly sweet to bring it up.  ever had anything like that happen?
[02/13/2006 07:33 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh no thats a different case
[02/13/2006 07:34 PM] Me: now you don't feel its right to fall back on the original girl because you can never be completely sure where your heart leads you?
[02/13/2006 07:34 PM] Me: that's how i feel now
[02/13/2006 07:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah exactly, every thing i see the first girl its really awkward
[02/13/2006 07:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: but i dont regret anything
[02/13/2006 07:35 PM] Me: i prayed to god asking him if i would ever find true love, god responds with 3 answers, yes, no, and wait.  when i prayed, all i got was a wait.
[02/13/2006 07:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: is that a joke?
[02/13/2006 07:35 PM] Dan Fairaizl: :-P
[02/13/2006 07:35 PM] Me: no, no joke
[02/13/2006 07:36 PM] Me: all i wanted was a yes or no, i didn't ask who or when, just IF
[02/13/2006 07:36 PM] Dan Fairaizl: how was this message given to you?
[02/13/2006 07:36 PM] Me: i just asked
[02/13/2006 07:37 PM] Me: then every part of my thought was filled with his answer, "wait"
[02/13/2006 07:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: dude your overanalysing this stuff again
[02/13/2006 07:37 PM] Me: am not!
[02/13/2006 07:37 PM] Me: :-P
[02/13/2006 07:38 PM] Me: but i have no choice but to obey, i will wait
[02/13/2006 07:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: does that mean wait until Amy comes down to see you...
[02/13/2006 07:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ?
[02/13/2006 07:38 PM] Me: not sure
[02/13/2006 07:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats the first thing i think of
[02/13/2006 07:39 PM] Me: i can only hope that my heart will not follow my parents example and instead lead me in the right direction
[02/13/2006 07:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: your a good guy just sit back wait like God says
[02/13/2006 07:40 PM] Me: waiting for Amy is hard, the only contact i have with her is through IM, and it is hard hearing every day that she did not have a good day, she is emotionally distraught, but when i was with her over break, everything was perfect
[02/13/2006 07:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you dont ever call her?

[03/01/2006 12:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: what are you doing?
[03/01/2006 12:15 PM] Me: dude i want to start a really large project
[03/01/2006 12:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh no... lol
[03/01/2006 12:15 PM] Me: ok its called CuIO
[03/01/2006 12:15 PM] Me: Custom input output system
[03/01/2006 12:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and...
[03/01/2006 12:16 PM] Me: it is basically a connections between your OS and your programs and output
[03/01/2006 12:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and does what
[03/01/2006 12:17 PM] Me: i wrote up a more detailed description
[03/01/2006 12:17 PM] Me: but there is a client side application that sends OS information and program information to an SQL server, then that server can be accessed through an interface on the web
[03/01/2006 12:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and whats the point of this?
[03/01/2006 12:18 PM] Me: and then of course one could write their own app to send customized information and display that
[03/01/2006 12:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: would that be slow
[03/01/2006 12:18 PM] Me: i could access my computer and do just as much as i could through remote desktop but from anywhere
[03/01/2006 12:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that would take a lot of work dude
[03/01/2006 12:19 PM] Me: yeah
[03/01/2006 12:19 PM] Me: well it doesn't use graphics
[03/01/2006 12:19 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but it uses the internet
[03/01/2006 12:19 PM] Me: its basically just a client side app connecting to an sql server
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and sending a ton of information
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Me: sql is easy
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Me: well that's the thing, it seems like a ton but its really all text and values if the sql server is organized the right way
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Me: the only problem MIGHT be is latency
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Me: i g2g to stupid people mathh
[03/01/2006 12:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah that WILL be a problem
[03/01/2006 12:21 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok think about it somemore
[03/01/2006 12:21 PM] Me: yeah i will
[03/01/2006 12:21 PM] Me: i just want to make enough i can start measuring its potential
[03/01/2006 12:21 PM] Me: g2g

[03/01/2006 05:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: without remote desktop
[03/01/2006 05:02 PM] Me: i would be able to pass simple commands through it

[03/01/2006 05:02 PM] Me: like windows 95
[03/01/2006 05:02 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao that simple eh?

[03/01/2006 05:03 PM] Me: but also what if we have a text to speech program hooked up to an answering machine through a PCI modem that accepted numbers i could get the status of my server over my cell phone by calling my computer

[03/03/2006 11:44 AM] Me: yeah did you think about CuIO, i think it should be considered as more conceptual not necessarily applied yet, the user could also make their own interface to access the server
[03/03/2006 11:44 AM] Me: yeah definitely
