 æšretty little thing, you read my mind 
 gather your things, we headed back to mine. 
 I came here looking for a girl of your kind 
 for a one night stand to be satisfied.?

 and I want to let it ride 
 tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 cæŠ¦on show me that youæŠ®e worthy, 
 show me that you want me bad enough.?Well your seething look of lust dictates 
 she is the love of my life 
 and we like to play games at night  
 to act like strangers 
 to let fantasy run wild 
 to use the imagination 
 in a fornicating playground high

 till I talked to your daddy he say 
 he said you ain't seen nothin' till you're down on a muffin 
 then you're sure to be a changin' your ways 
 I met a cheerleader was a real young bleeder 
 oh the times I could reminisce 
 'cause the best things of lovin' with her sister and her cousin 
 only started with a little kiss 
 like this 
  
 seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school 
 and your feet flyin' up in the air 
 singin' hey diddle diddle 
 with your kitty in the middle of the swing like you didn't care 
 so I took a big chance at the high school dance 
 with a missy who was ready to play 
 wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what she was doin' 
 and I knowed love was here to stay 
 when she told me to

[19/06/2004 12:17 AM] BrianJCullinan: sounds good
[19/06/2004 12:20 AM] BrianJCullinan: to tell you the truth, since i started talkng to you, it has been interesting the whole time, but it has kind of been up and down, what i mean is, when we would talk i would be thinking in the back of my mind, maybe i have a chance with this girl (you), and could really be more then just friends with her, but other times it seemed like you weren't really interested
[19/06/2004 12:20 AM] BrianJCullinan: it's been kind of confusing, but interesting none the less
[19/06/2004 12:20 AM] PradaRocker88: i dont even no u i have talk to u on the internet
[19/06/2004 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: and Greg seems to think we'd be good together
[19/06/2004 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: maybe it is too early to say that
[19/06/2004 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: i know, but we talk, a lot
[19/06/2004 12:21 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i don't want that to stop
[19/06/2004 12:22 AM] PradaRocker88: yea  i know it's fun
[19/06/2004 12:22 AM] BrianJCullinan: yeah...

[19/06/2004 12:23 AM] BrianJCullinan: don't be sorry
[19/06/2004 12:23 AM] BrianJCullinan: you didn't do anything

[19/06/2004 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: i'm not like trying to jump into things
[19/06/2004 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: like i said "i might have a chance"
[19/06/2004 12:24 AM] BrianJCullinan: just an assumption
