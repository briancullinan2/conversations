[01/08/2005 05:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: its not going to be anything you can't do in Adobe
[01/08/2005 05:29 PM] Alex: so how does Marcomedia kick Adobe's ass then?
[01/08/2005 05:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: because it does
[01/08/2005 05:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: its the package as a whole
[01/08/2005 05:30 PM] Alex: show me something you can't do in PS,  that you can do in FW/FH
[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: Macromedia not only has incredible graphic design, but it has everything
[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] Alex: show it.

[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] Alex: dreamweaver, don't make me laugh.
[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: Dreamweaver is most powerful
[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] Alex: i never said website, i said "image"
[01/08/2005 05:31 PM] Alex: image that YOU did.
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you think using software to make a site is for noobs?
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh, no, only notepad
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] Alex: if you believe FH/FW is better than PS
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] Alex: then show it.
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should where a shirt that says insert notepad here with a picture of an arrow and an ass
[01/08/2005 05:32 PM] Alex: quit talking down about something and show me what i've been asking for about 10mins now.

[01/08/2005 05:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: notepad is great but it sucks
[01/08/2005 05:34 PM] Alex: it's just dreamwaver does it automatically for you.
[01/08/2005 05:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah you could
[01/08/2005 05:34 PM] Alex: i get JavaScript errors

[01/08/2005 05:34 PM] Alex: when i click on Styles
[01/08/2005 05:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: the only thing i like in dreamweaver over notepad, it is highlights key words and formats code
[01/08/2005 05:35 PM] Alex: i've been using Notepad since I was like 9.
[01/08/2005 05:35 PM] Alex: i know howto check my own work.

[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: Maxthon?
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] Alex: try out Maxthon ;3
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's a new one
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: do they support alpha fading?
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] Alex: yes
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] Alex: it has IE's style support.
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: can you see it now?
[01/08/2005 05:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok j/w

[01/08/2005 05:40 PM] Alex: oh it's supposed to be a gradiant? D:
[01/08/2005 05:40 PM] Alex: k. D:
[01/08/2005 05:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/08/2005 05:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: well, gradiant, but it is alpha really, if you look at my CSS
[01/08/2005 05:40 PM] Alex: ya.

[01/08/2005 05:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok back to arguing about images
[01/08/2005 05:42 PM] Alex: are you gunna show me what you can't do in PS or not?
[01/08/2005 05:42 PM] Alex: 'cause i need to eat.
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: the style i have on that page is created by the capabilities of Fireworks, no plugins that Adobe would require to do that
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's it
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: right there
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] Alex: ... wtf?
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can't do that in adobe
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: without plugins
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] Alex: what exactly are you talking about now?
[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: (Link: http://24.251.168.143:8080/bjcullinan/)http://24.251.168.143:8080/bjcullinan/

[01/08/2005 05:43 PM] Alex: what abou tit? ~_~
[01/08/2005 05:44 PM] Alex: about*
[01/08/2005 05:44 PM] Alex: dsflsdfj whatever.
[01/08/2005 05:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: (Link: http://24.251.168.143:8080/bjcullinan/Styles/Example%201.png)http://24.251.168.143:8080/bjcullinan/Styles/Example%201.png
[01/08/2005 05:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: i also have lots of picture from fireworks on that site
[01/08/2005 05:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: under Other > Backgrounds
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] Alex: it looks like
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] Alex: lighting effect
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] Alex: and Curves
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: its called chrome
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] Alex: i know
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] Alex: but i'm saying the way you put it together
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[01/08/2005 05:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: pretty much
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] Alex: ps has lighting effect and curves =x
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] Alex: i don't see why you wouldn't be able to do something like it in PS.
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: but Fireworks is better
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] Alex: for one thing I know you can't exactly produce the same results in both.
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: but Macromedia has Dreamweaver and Flash too
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] Alex: i already said Flash was cool.
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: and nothing can top those two
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: and those four together, is better than Adobe
[01/08/2005 05:46 PM] Alex: uhhm.
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] Alex: right.
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] Alex: if you don't use Flash, then you don't have a use for Flash, period.
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] Alex: and i don't use Flash.
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: me neither
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] Alex: so arguing to me that Macromedia is better than Adobe because of Flash is kind of silly if I don't even use Flash.
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i'm gonna learn it
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: we're done arguing
[01/08/2005 05:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: Trillian is better than AIM
[01/08/2005 05:48 PM] Alex: k, good, i'm hungry.
[01/08/2005 05:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: me too

[01/27/2005 01:55 PM] Alex: ya

[01/27/2005 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: since it will be released for gaming and normal pc use
[01/27/2005 01:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's the idea at least
[01/27/2005 01:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: then microsoft will buy/overspend on it and fuck up the built in OS by making their own that's gonna be like 20 times bigger than it should and it will end up being no faster than computers today

[01/27/2005 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: leave it to microsoft to own something so good, and then suck more money out of our economy
[01/27/2005 01:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: then they will put them in everything
[01/27/2005 01:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: all sony electronics will have the microsoft cell
[01/27/2005 01:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: and we will all become suppressed because if microsoft wants to they will be able to control any device in the world, and ban you guid from their products because of what they think might get them in trouble

[04/16/2005 11:10 AM] Me: pretty GUI huh?
[04/16/2005 11:10 AM] Me: the buttons are all done in CSS
[04/16/2005 11:11 AM] Me: no javascript (style.background) changing
[04/16/2005 11:11 AM] Alex: heh
[04/16/2005 11:11 AM] Me: i thought that would make you proud
[04/16/2005 11:11 AM] Alex: :p
[04/16/2005 11:11 AM] Me: take note of the CSS too, it took me hours to figure out
[04/16/2005 11:12 AM] Alex: @_@
[04/16/2005 11:12 AM] Me: just changing a picture or a background would be easy, but this is changing the background of the parent of a link
[04/16/2005 11:12 AM] Alex: Heh, CSS trickery. XD
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Me: i finally figured out that i had to remove the link out of the doctype
 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//En">
 and then change the background of a <div> inside the link tag (<a>)
 
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Alex: D=
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Me: do you use the doctype?
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Alex: No. :S
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Me: it actually forces less functionality
[04/16/2005 11:13 AM] Alex: WC3 standards can kiss my ass.
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Me: because W3C is the cross browser standards
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Me: so if it works in one then it should work in the other
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Alex: @_@;
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Alex: I only want it to work in Firefox, lol.
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Me: which is bullshit because i have tried it with W3C, and it is different in others
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Alex: lol
[04/16/2005 11:14 AM] Me: i use different kinds of browsers to test it
[04/16/2005 11:15 AM] Me: and it works in internet explorer and netscape, if it works in both of those, it will work in anything
[04/16/2005 11:16 AM] Me: is it still version 1.0 on firefox?
[04/16/2005 11:16 AM] Alex: lol
[04/16/2005 11:16 AM] Alex: i think it's like 1.135495908405464596804890689065
[04/16/2005 11:16 AM] Me: lol
[04/16/2005 11:16 AM] Me: wow
[04/16/2005 11:18 AM] Me: netscape and IE are the most drastically different
[04/16/2005 11:18 AM] Me: its amazing
[04/16/2005 11:18 AM] Alex: D:
[04/16/2005 11:18 AM] Me: i think maybe because netscape forces the W3C standards
[04/16/2005 11:19 AM] Me: and the W3C ruins my complex javascripts
[04/16/2005 11:19 AM] Alex: :x
[04/16/2005 11:19 AM] Me: i do stuff that depends on the page height, but i can't when W3C is enabled
[04/16/2005 11:28 AM] Me: so what time should i pick you up?
[04/16/2005 11:28 AM] Me: don't you have to call the gate nazis
