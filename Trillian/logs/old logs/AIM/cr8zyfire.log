cr8zyfire: lol, Cindy tol dme
BrianJCullinan: oh, wonderful
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: anywho, sorry about my friend last monday
cr8zyfire: that's ok
BrianJCullinan: its tradition, if you will, to point out all the cute new girls, but this year he thought he should be extra immature and embarrass me
cr8zyfire: heehee, I've never had any guy call me pretty before so I thought it was cool
BrianJCullinan: so sorry if he embarrassed you as well
BrianJCullinan: that will change, you are very pretty
BrianJCullinan: i expected that you hear it all the time
cr8zyfire: thanks, it wasn't embarrasing
BrianJCullinan: well, if you got to know Seth, you'd regret it
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: its probably hard to tell but hes really a senior
cr8zyfire: oh, lol
BrianJCullinan: the school will only have to put up with him one more year
cr8zyfire: heehee, r u a senior?
BrianJCullinan: lol, only a junior
BrianJCullinan: 'only'
BrianJCullinan: your kind of shy in person
cr8zyfire: well, I'm 'only' a freshman, I think that's lower
BrianJCullinan: i wish we had talked more sooner
cr8zyfire: I'm more open online cuz I don't have to look at the person, or really worry what they think to much, if I embarrass myself really bad I can just sign off
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: yeah thats an advantage
cr8zyfire: yeah, I like talking to people online
BrianJCullinan: and i can only imagine, being a freshman in such a new environment, being harrassed my imature seniors, darn kids you know?
BrianJCullinan: well i'm glad we have exchanged screen names now
BrianJCullinan: you won't be embarrassed when you talk to me at school
cr8zyfire: lol, I like it better than middle school cuz u don't have to do the stupid points thing
cr8zyfire: no
BrianJCullinan: and i'll be able to talk to you to
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: so do you use the computer a lot?
cr8zyfire: I would've talked to u sooner but I didn't know if I should cuz u didn't say anything to me
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry i should have
cr8zyfire: yes, I'm almost physically attacted to my computer
BrianJCullinan: i guess i'm shy around girls i don't know
BrianJCullinan: lol good, i use the computer a lot to
cr8zyfire: lol, sometimes I even put up away messages when I go to sleep
BrianJCullinan: i'll burn you a copy of the study program i wrote myself
cr8zyfire: study program?
BrianJCullinan: yeah you put the vocabulary words in it, and its like flashcards except on your computer
BrianJCullinan: and it keeps track of scores you can print out
BrianJCullinan: i like it cuz then i don't have to study with my parents
BrianJCullinan: they anger me
cr8zyfire: oh cool, I'm glad I never had to study with mine, they haven't understood my homework since maybe 6th grade and I didn't need help before that
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: yur one of those really smart kids
BrianJCullinan: i'm in all stupid people classes
BrianJCullinan: sooo, your probably 14 right?
cr8zyfire: lol, I'm not that smart, I just get whatever people tell me pretty fast, or maybe I'm just school smart, cuz I've dodged bugs and run into poles instead, I think that was stupid

BrianJCullinan: do you think you can stand the heat all year?
BrianJCullinan: bet you can't wait until the first game
cr8zyfire: I hope so
BrianJCullinan: its not even a home game, even worse because their fields are different
cr8zyfire: yeah, then I can march at night, which is when I play better
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: are you nervous?
BrianJCullinan: ?

BrianJCullinan: andrea had those skanky fish net sleeves and didn't get bit at all
cr8zyfire: they're like mosquito netting, lol
BrianJCullinan: they are funny looking
BrianJCullinan: i told her she looks dirty in them
cr8zyfire: I don't like the sleeves, but I have the tights in black and turquiose
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: you should wear them
cr8zyfire: I've got into a phase where I love weird tights
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: which color?
BrianJCullinan: black is better
BrianJCullinan: its a more happy color
cr8zyfire: k
cr8zyfire: totally!
cr8zyfire: heehee
cr8zyfire: I have a skirt that's black with white stripes on it
cr8zyfire: I could wear them with that
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: like gothic people
BrianJCullinan: how naughty
BrianJCullinan: i was very surprised you were violating the dress code the first day of school
cr8zyfire: lol, heehee, that's y I brought the jacket, I wasn't sure if I was dress code
BrianJCullinan: oh yes, i wrote an article on it last year
BrianJCullinan: never submitted it though
BrianJCullinan: i have a lot of articles
cr8zyfire: oh, cool
cr8zyfire: I like writing
BrianJCullinan: i use strong and well written sentances to make administration look bad
cr8zyfire: heehee!
BrianJCullinan: writting is good
BrianJCullinan: you should read my articles, they make people laugh
cr8zyfire: sure, I will
BrianJCullinan: last year for english class we had to write a motivational speach to try and convince someone to enact upon your argument, so i wrote:
 the school should invest in automatic tazers to make slow people walk faster
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: and i tried to keep a strait face the whole time but it was really hard
cr8zyfire: that'd work really well
BrianJCullinan: and then at band camp, that was probably the second time i've been infront of an audience in my life
BrianJCullinan: no understood have the things on our list anyways
cr8zyfire: like the principal would run around going "Get to class people" zap! zap! 
BrianJCullinan: did you like it?
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: yeah, cattle prods for all the new freshman
BrianJCullinan: you have to herd them around
BrianJCullinan: like sheep
cr8zyfire: lol, sometimes if feels like that, everyone's like " I don't know where to go, oohhh I'll follow them!!"
BrianJCullinan: yeah, lemmings
cr8zyfire: heehee
BrianJCullinan: we should publish our presentation at band camp huh?
BrianJCullinan: why didn't you preform something
BrianJCullinan: ?
cr8zyfire: cuz I don't really like public speaking
BrianJCullinan: lol me either
cr8zyfire: and I didn't know what to perform
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: i don't like talking to people
BrianJCullinan: they make me feel insecure
cr8zyfire: I contradict myself, like when I'm with people I like I almost HAVE to be the center of attention a lot of the time, and other times I get so lonerish and I just want everyone to leave me alone
cr8zyfire: I'm pretty weird, and sometimes when I talk to people they get this look on their face like "who is this insane person and when is she gonna leave?"
BrianJCullinan: lol i look at people like that
cr8zyfire: heehee
cr8zyfire: well, you'll probably end up doing it to me at least once
BrianJCullinan: other students in the class have said doesn't he make you fell stupid when he looks at you like that
cr8zyfire: one of my friends stopped talking to me because she thought I was tooo weird
BrianJCullinan: and i say what do you mean? you are stupid
BrianJCullinan: i'm hiding
cr8zyfire: lol, I almost like being looked at like that just because I hate being called normal, average, or sane
BrianJCullinan: like a turtle
cr8zyfire: where?
BrianJCullinan: i'm hiding in my room
cr8zyfire: in a shell?
BrianJCullinan: kinda feels like it
cr8zyfire: coincidence, I do that!
cr8zyfire: heehee
BrianJCullinan: i hide from humanity
cr8zyfire: my sister yells at me "Y don't you get out of your room!:
BrianJCullinan: what do you hide from/?
BrianJCullinan: how old is your sister?
cr8zyfire: I'm not sure
cr8zyfire: 12
BrianJCullinan: lol ha, and she yells at you
cr8zyfire: she'll be a freshman when I'm a senior
BrianJCullinan: i'd shut the door in her face
cr8zyfire: she's a bossy little brat, I do
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: my brothers will be a freshman next year
BrianJCullinan: and in the band, lucky me
cr8zyfire: she loves little kids and adults get all "ahhh isn't she sweet!" when she watches them, but I know she only does it because they idolize her and do whatever she says
cr8zyfire: yeah, she plays clarinet
BrianJCullinan: my brother plays drums
cr8zyfire: I've always kinda wanted to play the drums
BrianJCullinan: no

cr8zyfire: and we're gonna get more when concert band starts!
BrianJCullinan: well 13 flutes is 13 TOO MANY
BrianJCullinan: ok nevermind

BrianJCullinan: ditzy is funny
cr8zyfire: it was the things in common line

BrianJCullinan: that was dumb
BrianJCullinan: i didn't like their little games
BrianJCullinan: i didn't participate
cr8zyfire: yeah, the one hold hands thing was messed up, we made like 3 circles and couldn't untangle
BrianJCullinan: me and Eric just got out on purpose
cr8zyfire: lol
cr8zyfire: I had to go to freshman camp for one day...
BrianJCullinan: hes really funny but you have to listen closly or you'll miss it
cr8zyfire: ...shudder...
BrianJCullinan: yeah?
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: you like ride the pony?
cr8zyfire: no
BrianJCullinan: did they make you do that?
BrianJCullinan: haha
cr8zyfire: no, they made us push a pecan across the floor with our nose
BrianJCullinan: ewww

BrianJCullinan: thats unsanitary
cr8zyfire: I know!
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: you did?
BrianJCullinan: good
BrianJCullinan: lol thats funny i would to
BrianJCullinan: i'd be like oops mine broke time to go home
cr8zyfire: well, first I started to do the little nose thing and then I got really annoyed and stepped on it
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: i had to go last year
BrianJCullinan: i can't believe they didn't do ride the pony
cr8zyfire: when u were a sophmore?

cr8zyfire: I thought u meant an actually pony
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: no
BrianJCullinan: the game
cr8zyfire: yeah, they had us do that
BrianJCullinan: that game scared me
cr8zyfire: I ran around a little bit too humor them then ran back in the circle and hid behind people
cr8zyfire: it is scary!
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: not really the best thing to be teaching little kids
BrianJCullinan: how to ride ponies and such
BrianJCullinan: very dirty
cr8zyfire: and we had to put petrolium jelly on our noses and try to pass a cotton ball with it, I just took it and handed it to the next person
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: sounds like you had fun
BrianJCullinan: what kind of music do you listen to?
cr8zyfire: my little group was the least spirited, we just sat there and gave each other this is stupid looks
cr8zyfire: I listen too...oh one sec phone
cr8zyfire: my sister, she said she rang the doorbell 50 times and could I unlock the door
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: music?
cr8zyfire: I like mainly rockish stuff
BrianJCullinan: good, not rap
BrianJCullinan: cuz if you liked rap i'd have to slap some sence into you
cr8zyfire: like my favorite bands r Linkin Park (well, there is rapping, but it's good rap), Less Than Jake, Green Day, Evanescence, No Doubt, and Sleater-Kinney
BrianJCullinan: i've listened to linkin park and greenday rules above all, but the others i haven't heard of
BrianJCullinan: i listen to what ever is convinient
BrianJCullinan: classical, instrumental stuff is always good
cr8zyfire: lol, I'll listen to classical when I'm really hyper and start cracking up because I like inventing little senarios (can't spell) that go with the music
BrianJCullinan: we have been talking for over an hour and a half now
cr8zyfire: interesting
cr8zyfire: I like talking
cr8zyfire: heehee
cr8zyfire: typeing
BrianJCullinan: yeah me to
cr8zyfire: *typing
BrianJCullinan: you should talk more often
BrianJCullinan: in person
cr8zyfire: yeah, I'm like an m&m
cr8zyfire: that is a weird 'and' sign
BrianJCullinan: hmm?
BrianJCullinan: i know
BrianJCullinan: an ampersand
BrianJCullinan: &
BrianJCullinan: ahh young eager minds
cr8zyfire: I'm like all standoffish to new people in person and I'm not really myself (the coating thing) and then when I get to know them better I'm all weeheeheehee (the chocolate stuff) and  oooh that is a bad analogy really
BrianJCullinan: i was just going to tell you that
BrianJCullinan: its a bad analogy
cr8zyfire: lol, I know
cr8zyfire: sometimes I don't stop to think and confuse myself
BrianJCullinan: you confuse me too
cr8zyfire: I confuse everyohe
cr8zyfire: *n
BrianJCullinan: no more dress code violations
cr8zyfire: lol, I'll make sure to bring a jacket
BrianJCullinan: that was random
BrianJCullinan: but neccissary
cr8zyfire: heehe
cr8zyfire: randomness is fun
cr8zyfire: y? u don't want me wearing a shirt that's waaaaaay to big for me?
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: the pe shorts r down to my knees and they're smalls
BrianJCullinan: bring a jacket
BrianJCullinan: good idea
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: because you can always take off the jacket when no one is looking
cr8zyfire: I only own one jacket
cr8zyfire: isn't that pathetic
BrianJCullinan: but if you took off the shirt someone might try and rape you
BrianJCullinan: that would be bad
cr8zyfire: yeah really
BrianJCullinan: and tramatizing
cr8zyfire: yeah
cr8zyfire: and I might need a ton of hugs
BrianJCullinan: yeah
cr8zyfire: only that might make me have flashbacks so then I'd try to kill the person
BrianJCullinan: or you might never like a guy agaim
BrianJCullinan: n
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: can't stop tapping
cr8zyfire: of course I'm really weird when if comes to guys

cr8zyfire: heehee!
BrianJCullinan: hes a freaking psyco
cr8zyfire: lol

cr8zyfire: y?
BrianJCullinan: he does that when i bother my brothers
BrianJCullinan: or when i hurt them, he hurts me
cr8zyfire: oh really
BrianJCullinan: hes a child abuser
cr8zyfire: oh, that's sad
cr8zyfire: *tear*
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to hook up his speakers to my microphone and tap a lot
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: yeah, sad, i need a hug
cr8zyfire: *hugs the computer*
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: I put a sticker that says shake well before each use on it
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: good idea
cr8zyfire: it was on a can of silly string
cr8zyfire: heehee
cr8zyfire: I still have the can
cr8zyfire: I used the other one to cover Mat (baritone guy) in it
BrianJCullinan: good
BrianJCullinan: i don't like him
BrianJCullinan: he can't march
cr8zyfire: lol, he was kinda my friend (ish) last year, but now he doesn't talk to me anymore so I'm mad at him
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: thats sad
cr8zyfire: yeah
cr8zyfire: I've never had guy friends
BrianJCullinan: do you need a hug?
cr8zyfire: oh, yeah, sure
BrianJCullinan: that will change, you just have to talk to guys more
cr8zyfire: they never talk to me
cr8zyfire: and I think they'd avoid me if I went up and just started talking to them
BrianJCullinan: because they are afraid of rejection
cr8zyfire: lol, I've never had to reject anyone
BrianJCullinan: yeah but they don't know that
cr8zyfire: lol, true
BrianJCullinan: maybe they are just left speachless because of how pretty you are
cr8zyfire: lol, sure
BrianJCullinan: its true
BrianJCullinan: i would know
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: no one has ever said that to you before?
BrianJCullinan: you probably had lots of boyfriends in middle school
cr8zyfire: I guess I never have thought of myself as "speechlessly" pretty
cr8zyfire: nope
cr8zyfire: I've never had a bf
BrianJCullinan: amazing
BrianJCullinan: where do these girls come from
cr8zyfire: I just eventually decided that they were afraid of me
BrianJCullinan: guys are bad for you
cr8zyfire: so what does that make u?
BrianJCullinan: i'm bad, you can't trust me
cr8zyfire: lol
cr8zyfire: I'm a band geek, u sure u can trust me?
BrianJCullinan: never let down your gaurd
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: ok
BrianJCullinan: yeah i'm sure
cr8zyfire: I really am a nerd, I don't look like it anymore but I am
BrianJCullinan: you ever wear glasses?
cr8zyfire: when I take out my contacts
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: contacts?
BrianJCullinan: never tried them
BrianJCullinan: and don't want to have to
cr8zyfire: u need glases?
cr8zyfire: *glasses
BrianJCullinan: for reading close up, but i don't wear them anyways
cr8zyfire: oh, I have really really bad vision
cr8zyfire: I couldn't just take my glasses off and not have anything
cr8zyfire: all I see are these little blurry blobs
BrianJCullinan: lol thats so sad
cr8zyfire: really, when I sit in my computer chair I can't even see the screen with out my glasses
cr8zyfire: and I'm near-sighted
cr8zyfire: it's really sad
BrianJCullinan: how sad
BrianJCullinan: you should get it fixed with a laser
cr8zyfire: my mom had it
BrianJCullinan: did it work?
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: did they burn eyes in the back of her head?
cr8zyfire: she said u have to be 18 though, something about your eyes still changing
cr8zyfire: I think they just shape something
BrianJCullinan: yeah
cr8zyfire: she said it didn't hurt
cr8zyfire: my stepdad watched
cr8zyfire: I said ewww
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: I wouldn't have wanted to watch
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: just wait until you get to biology
BrianJCullinan: you know aspertame is the most comman sugar substitue
cr8zyfire: interesting
BrianJCullinan: and it breaks down into the fluid used to preserve dead animals before disection
cr8zyfire: wasn't saccharine till they found out it was poisonous or something?
cr8zyfire: ick
BrianJCullinan: and people eat it all the time, its that really bad smelling stuff
cr8zyfire: gross
BrianJCullinan: have you ever done a disection lab?
cr8zyfire: owl pellets
cr8zyfire: and they had us see cow tongue and stuff like that
BrianJCullinan: i've done owl pellets, worm, and pig heart
cr8zyfire: oh
BrianJCullinan: and a frog
cr8zyfire: I think the main problem would be that it smells
BrianJCullinan: nasty stuff
BrianJCullinan: yeah
cr8zyfire: yeah
BrianJCullinan: and people injest that smell
BrianJCullinan: daily
BrianJCullinan: in their food
cr8zyfire: cuz blood doesn't bother me, but I don't like gross smells
cr8zyfire: makes me want to be a vegetarian
BrianJCullinan: lol
cr8zyfire: too bad I don't like vegatables that much
BrianJCullinan: me neither
cr8zyfire: *vegetable
BrianJCullinan: if its green its bad for you
BrianJCullinan: litke buggers
BrianJCullinan: *like boogers
cr8zyfire: one of my friends would bring yellow peppers, a salad, and a tomato and a salt shaker for lunch, and she wasn't a vegetarian
cr8zyfire: boogers can be brown
BrianJCullinan: ewww
cr8zyfire: and red if u have a bloody nose
BrianJCullinan: i should practice
BrianJCullinan: so i can be all that i can be
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: and strong lips
cr8zyfire: that'd be the cue to salute
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: who would want to play flute?
BrianJCullinan: you don't get strong lip muscles
BrianJCullinan: all you have to do is blow air
cr8zyfire: um, I don't know, my 4th grade self
BrianJCullinan: and its so small and lightweight its not hard to carry
cr8zyfire: u get really big lungs though
BrianJCullinan: and theres always too many of them
cr8zyfire: lol
BrianJCullinan: and if the flute section gets lazy and doesn't hold them up strait and makes our score go down at festivals i'll be angry
BrianJCullinan: i'll throw a stick at them
cr8zyfire: lol, I won't do that, I hate it too, I get soooo mad when I go to my sister's band concerts and see the little flute girls playing with the thing practically touching the ground
cr8zyfire: I want to smack them, I always make fun of flutes at the little kid things
cr8zyfire: cuz they do all the things I hate
cr8zyfire: like breathing after every note
cr8zyfire: (now I started tapping)
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: thats funny too
BrianJCullinan: stupid kids

cr8zyfire: I got my mom to sign me up for this web design class, only the days I was there we did typing (I could already type really fast) and then the day I was gone (cuz I was in VA with my friend) they did the web stuff
BrianJCullinan: using a programming language and my highly scientific mind

BrianJCullinan: wel webdesign is the future
BrianJCullinan: and its a good think your interested
BrianJCullinan: because anyone that is, is going to go a long way
