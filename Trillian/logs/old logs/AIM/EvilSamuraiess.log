poopiedoobles05: not going to happen
EvilSamuraiess: are you a virgin?
poopiedoobles05: yup
EvilSamuraiess: what's the rush? not being a virgin doesn't make you feel any different, except icky sometimes.
EvilSamuraiess: if it's any consolation, i'd sleep with you if i were unattached.
poopiedoobles05: unattached?
EvilSamuraiess: i have a boyfriend, in case you didn't notice
poopiedoobles05: now i feel stupid
poopiedoobles05: i know
poopiedoobles05: i just didn't know what you meant by unattached
EvilSamuraiess: you're not stupid, and you know it.
EvilSamuraiess: did you have mcmullin?
poopiedoobles05: no
EvilSamuraiess: well, i'll tell you this anyway.
EvilSamuraiess: do you know what the rocky horror picture show is?
poopiedoobles05: ok?
poopiedoobles05: yeah
EvilSamuraiess: mcmullin was in the stage crew at the live showing for a really long time, and he played janet.
EvilSamuraiess: he told me this while we were hiking yesterday. i found that to be hilarious.
EvilSamuraiess: yeah, you can ignore me. i don't mind. i'm just a piece of shit anyway.
EvilSamuraiess: *bang*
poopiedoobles05: keep going?
EvilSamuraiess: i was through. but you could ahve said something to humor me.
EvilSamuraiess: like "that was great." or "you're an expert" or something encouraging like that.
poopiedoobles05: i didn't get it because i'm a dumbass
EvilSamuraiess: *sigh* 
EvilSamuraiess: i'm going to shoot you.
EvilSamuraiess: and then laugh. and perhaps urinate on your dead body.
EvilSamuraiess: i'm so weird.
poopiedoobles05: sounds pleasent
poopiedoobles05: but not very good for emotional uprising
poopiedoobles05: how is this boyfriend?
EvilSamuraiess: i got on bradley's screen name today (which is how i got your screen name) and imed tildo, telling him all of these homoerotic things
EvilSamuraiess: it was great.
EvilSamuraiess: he was like "um...bradley, i'm not gay."
poopiedoobles05: wow
EvilSamuraiess: bradley's password is so gay
EvilSamuraiess: if i were really evil, i'd get back on it and do some serious damage.
EvilSamuraiess: i'd make his profile same something really nasty, and im everyone soliciting dirty anal sex.
poopiedoobles05: so hows the boyfriend?
EvilSamuraiess: he's fine...
poopiedoobles05: you were angry with him friday, have a sudden change of heart?

EvilSamuraiess: no. i haven't seen him since thursday, haha
poopiedoobles05: wow

poopiedoobles05: next time your boyfriend pisses you off, i'm here
EvilSamuraiess: well, i know you're here for me.
poopiedoobles05: you could get back at him by doing something with someone as ugly as me, guys hate it when there woman turns on them and does stuff when an ugly  guy
EvilSamuraiess: first off, you're not ugly.
poopiedoobles05: lol, suuuuuuuuure
EvilSamuraiess: i think you're attractive. why you'd want to sleep with my fat ass is the mystery at hand.

BrianJCullinan: i don't understand you
BrianJCullinan: i wish you didn't have a boyfriend
EvilSamuraiess: brian, you want to know the honest truth? i had such a crush on you last year during the musical, but you were so hung up on lauren gassick i just gave up, and realized it was futile.
BrianJCullinan: lol shes stuck up
EvilSamuraiess: i know.
BrianJCullinan: you were with adam then
EvilSamuraiess: his name was david.
BrianJCullinan: yeah him
BrianJCullinan: lol
BrianJCullinan: why did you like me, i was imature
EvilSamuraiess: but regardless, i still really liked you. but then i just kinda shrugged it off. i felt like it was pointless.
BrianJCullinan: lol i just said was, i'm (still am) imature
BrianJCullinan: y?
BrianJCullinan: would you like me?
EvilSamuraiess: you're funny and really sweet and supportive.
BrianJCullinan: of all people?
EvilSamuraiess: you're a great friend.
BrianJCullinan: when you could go out with the really cool kids like tildo that exclude u when drinking
BrianJCullinan: those darn kool kids that don't spell cool right and can't use adjectives longer then 4 words
EvilSamuraiess: tildo does piss me off with his excessive drug usage, but thus far he hasn't really done anything to hurt me...
EvilSamuraiess: and we've only been going out for a few weeks.
EvilSamuraiess: so i still am just getting a feel for the relationship...you know?
BrianJCullinan: them and their drinking and other miscillenious hilucnegens
BrianJCullinan: well i hope it feels good, hes probably got a bigger cock then i do anywas, which is of course what really matters in society today

BrianJCullinan: it was just a fucking example

EvilSamuraiess: i'm sort of offended.
BrianJCullinan: it kinda fit in with the hilucinagens, and what not
BrianJCullinan: hilucinegens alter peoples thinking, hence the name, but the kool kids do it, and you're dating one
EvilSamuraiess: he doesn't do mushrooms, first off.
EvilSamuraiess: just smokes pot.
BrianJCullinan: hope you're happy, good luck with the relationship, i think i'll go back to talking to my computer

BrianJCullinan: pot is a hilucinagen
BrianJCullinan: i had a bad dream
EvilSamuraiess: no, not it's not. but regardless of your lack of knowledge of drugs...
EvilSamuraiess: about me?
BrianJCullinan: it provoked me to be a hermit like last year
EvilSamuraiess: what are you talking about brian?
BrianJCullinan: anything that alters someones state of mind is a hilucinagen, look it up
BrianJCullinan: what do you mean, what am i talking about ?
BrianJCullinan: i'm a hermit
BrianJCullinan: like a crab
BrianJCullinan: thats a figure of speach
EvilSamuraiess: certain drugs are under that name, just as pcp, mushrooms, acid, lsd. pot is not a hallucinogen
BrianJCullinan: last year i was a hermit
EvilSamuraiess: i know what a hermit is.
EvilSamuraiess: but where the hell did that come from? it was random.
EvilSamuraiess: we weren't talking about being a loner....
BrianJCullinan: my dream provoked me to be a hermit

EvilSamuraiess: well, i don't care. i want to know what it was about! i want to help you...
BrianJCullinan: and being held at gunpoint to move
BrianJCullinan: no i'd rather be a hermit
BrianJCullinan: kool kids carry weapons
BrianJCullinan: does your boyfriend?
BrianJCullinan: how old is he?
EvilSamuraiess: no, he doesn't.
EvilSamuraiess: he's 16, he's a sophomore like me
BrianJCullinan: thats good
BrianJCullinan: i was going to be a pedaphile next year
BrianJCullinan: if i kept dating Brianna
BrianJCullinan: *walls close in, lights flicker off*
EvilSamuraiess: well, if you dated me you'd be in the same boat.
BrianJCullinan: yeah but you would have been worth it
BrianJCullinan: might have lasted longer, we get along pretty well
EvilSamuraiess: why would i be worth it, brian? what if i never put out?
BrianJCullinan: well then there wouldn't have been anything and your last statement would be irrelevent
BrianJCullinan: duh
BrianJCullinan: except for my uncontrollable need to pull people down with me
EvilSamuraiess: i can keep you up. it's a talent of mine.
BrianJCullinan: ok what happened to you talking about not putting out
BrianJCullinan: that contradicts your previous statement
BrianJCullinan: aren't you in debate club
BrianJCullinan: ?
EvilSamuraiess: well, you seem to be pretty intent on my body, not mind. so what kind of relationship would we have if i never slept with you?
BrianJCullinan: wtf mate?

BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: y are you expressing negative feelings towards me?
EvilSamuraiess: because you're pissing me off.
BrianJCullinan: how?
BrianJCullinan: what have i done?
EvilSamuraiess: first of all, you're scaring the shit out of me and i feel really vulnerable. second of all, you're doubting my master debating skills. 
BrianJCullinan: because whatever i have done i'm sorry, i didn't mean to
EvilSamuraiess: you don't think you're being mean right now? i have no idea why you're being like this. you have never acted like this before, brian.
BrianJCullinan: lol i know you're an excellent debater
BrianJCullinan: i was only joking
BrianJCullinan: sorry it made you angry i really didn't mean it
BrianJCullinan: and work sucks
EvilSamuraiess: brian, what is going on right now?
BrianJCullinan: thats why i'm upset, and i had to go to church and i hate church, and as i said before i have an uncontrollable need to drag people down with me
BrianJCullinan: thats whats going on
BrianJCullinan: i twitch too, it's funny to watch myself
EvilSamuraiess: brian, i hate church to. actually, i'm listening to a nin song called "heresy" as we speak. the chorus is "your god is dead, and no one cares, if there is a hell, i'll see you there."
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: then you don't blame me for being upset?
BrianJCullinan: we kool?
BrianJCullinan: i have a reasonable arguement too
EvilSamuraiess: brian, you're really scaring me.
EvilSamuraiess: i don't know what's going on. i'm really confused.
EvilSamuraiess: if you need to tell me something, just tell me.
BrianJCullinan: hm?
BrianJCullinan: why am i scary?
BrianJCullinan: maybe it's the music you're listening to
EvilSamuraiess: what you're saying...they way you're acting. so defensive and tormented.
EvilSamuraiess: it's not nine inch nails, it's you.
BrianJCullinan: why?
BrianJCullinan: i'm not defensive
EvilSamuraiess: haha, very funny.
EvilSamuraiess: brian, it's sweet that you're worried about me. but if i've learned anything through these almoat 16 years, it's that i can handle myself.
BrianJCullinan: thats good
BrianJCullinan: now whos being defensive?
BrianJCullinan: want me to send you my argument about religion?
BrianJCullinan: might cheer you up
BrianJCullinan: made me laugh at myself, it's funny
EvilSamuraiess: well, ok
BrianJCullinan:  
 Me:  What makes our religion "right" mommy? 
 Mommy:  It's about what you believe in son... 
 Me:  Well i don't believe in killing thousands of people and starting massive wars over many centuries all because of a "greater being". 
 Me:  I don't believe in priests lying to suit their own pleasure and benifit 
 Me:  I don't believe in secrets being kept over hundreds of years and finally being revealed within the last 2 decades. 
 Mommy:  What secrets saten? 
 Me (Saten):  The secrets about the church killing scientists whos discoveries keep almost everyone alive and healthy.  Scientists killed because they believed something different. 
 
EvilSamuraiess: well, you know i'm a daughter of science, so that strikes me as unbelievably true.
BrianJCullinan: yeah, it's nice isn't it
EvilSamuraiess: i like it
BrianJCullinan: whats funny is my dad grabbed my brothers neck in church today squeezed tightly and mumble a few threatening words into is redening ear
EvilSamuraiess: well, that's a true christian for you.
EvilSamuraiess: i've never believed in a god, and i never will. too hypocritical.
BrianJCullinan: all because he chuckled at a gesture he had made ( his gesture was exaggerating the priests wishes for everyone to bow a little lower then they used to )
BrianJCullinan: well i believe in something creating first life
BrianJCullinan: maybe aliens
EvilSamuraiess: i'm sorry, brian. if it's any consolation yesterday my mother told me in a detailed plan how she was going to abandon me within the next couple of weeks. she's kmy best friend, and she didnt think twice about it.
EvilSamuraiess: i believe in evolution.
BrianJCullinan: maybe our earth has been here longer then we could ever tell
BrianJCullinan: i to
BrianJCullinan: but why is your mom going to abandon you?
BrianJCullinan: i'll never abandon you
BrianJCullinan: you can come stay with me
EvilSamuraiess: because she doesn't want her job or her husband anymore. i was an afterthought...i'm her best friend, and she didn't think twice about me. so i yelled at her, and i hope she changed her mind.
BrianJCullinan: i'll feed you
BrianJCullinan: awww
BrianJCullinan: thats sad
BrianJCullinan: but it's better then being abused
EvilSamuraiess: yeah, it is.
BrianJCullinan: i have a journal
BrianJCullinan: on the comp.
BrianJCullinan: where i wrote after my dad had gone off
EvilSamuraiess: i'm really sorry...
BrianJCullinan: i'll never forget this one time, that i'm not going to tell you about because it will make me sound weak and vulnerable but thats not really the issue i just don't feel like talking about it
BrianJCullinan: but it was bad
EvilSamuraiess: ...
BrianJCullinan: and then there was that other time, because it used to happen alot all because of retaliation to something my brother did to me first, and he used to say we don't need to be hitting eachother when he does it to us
BrianJCullinan: hes a hipocrit to
EvilSamuraiess: i wish i could say something to sooth your pain....
BrianJCullinan: i don't hurt
BrianJCullinan: it hurts me when i hurt other people
BrianJCullinan: and i was scaring you, and fear is almost like pain and hurt because it leads to worse things
EvilSamuraiess: i guess i can understand where you're coming from, but you were scaring me.
BrianJCullinan: fear to anger, anger leads to resentment, and that leads to more pain and anger
BrianJCullinan: you said i was
BrianJCullinan: and that hurt
BrianJCullinan: cuz i don't want to scare you
EvilSamuraiess: i know you don't...but you're just acting so different.
BrianJCullinan: i want to be closer to you
BrianJCullinan: and then you said i was only interested in your body, which hurts a lot too, because i was trying to be sincere
EvilSamuraiess: i appreciate that, thank you. that means a lot that you trust me.
EvilSamuraiess: it just seemed like that's all i was. i'm used to that. the last two boyfriends i've had (outside of tildo) were only with me for my body...
BrianJCullinan: how am i different?  I just had a bad day, shit happens
BrianJCullinan: well, i'm not like that
BrianJCullinan: i hope
EvilSamuraiess: when people have bad days they act different...
EvilSamuraiess: well, brian, i don't know if you are honestly. but i'm sure you're more than just that.
BrianJCullinan: and i feel arrogant for giving you that impression, and i'm even stupider for not knowing how i did it
EvilSamuraiess: don't worry about it...it's just something i'm paranoid about. it's my thing, not yours.
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry
EvilSamuraiess: it's not your fault...
BrianJCullinan: you've probably been through a lot
EvilSamuraiess: well, not really. i make my own hell better than anyone else can. i have such a low self esteem about the way i look, i sort of get easy when i'm with people who think i'm beautiful. i think i'm so ugly. and fat. ew.
BrianJCullinan: if something happens between you and tildo that you don't like, you can talk to me, i'll be here for you, and he is a lower classman, i'm not intimidated in the least, so if you needed me to take care of something, i will do my best, but i'm sure you two will be great for eachother
EvilSamuraiess: i hope so. he's very respectful of my body and me as a person.
EvilSamuraiess: but thank you for being there.
BrianJCullinan: i think you beautiful, but i wouldn't take advantage
EvilSamuraiess: thank you..
BrianJCullinan: toons!
EvilSamuraiess: toons?
BrianJCullinan: toons
EvilSamuraiess: yes, toons.
BrianJCullinan: yay toons
EvilSamuraiess: wahoo toons.
BrianJCullinan: what?
BrianJCullinan: still mad at me?
EvilSamuraiess: no.
BrianJCullinan: thats good
BrianJCullinan: still think i'm different?
EvilSamuraiess: well, you've always been different. but i'm still kinda coming off of being a little frightened...
BrianJCullinan: why were you frightened?
EvilSamuraiess: ...you were getting obsessive. it was kind of scary.
BrianJCullinan: obsessive?
BrianJCullinan: with what?
EvilSamuraiess: me
BrianJCullinan: how?
BrianJCullinan: thats scary?
BrianJCullinan: because i'm here for you?
EvilSamuraiess: to me it is. brian, i've almost been raped twice. attention gets scary...
BrianJCullinan: maybe i'm just really precise and descriptive
EvilSamuraiess: and no, it's not the fact that you're here for me. that part makes me happy.
BrianJCullinan: not obsessive
EvilSamuraiess: i feel better knowing i have a friend like you.
BrianJCullinan: that kind of offends me
EvilSamuraiess: well, you offended me earlier.
BrianJCullinan: that you would bring up almost being raped
BrianJCullinan: i don't want to be even, i don't want it to happen
EvilSamuraiess: well, it sort of sits in the foreground of you mind
BrianJCullinan: i can only imagine
BrianJCullinan: but i thought you knew me better then that before we started talking tonight
EvilSamuraiess: i thought i did too.
EvilSamuraiess: but you were so different...
BrianJCullinan: but you don't?
EvilSamuraiess: that's what scared me, brian. i know you so well, and you're not acting like yourself.
EvilSamuraiess: and i feel really bad, and i want to help you somehow, and you won't let me.
BrianJCullinan: lol it's because i had a bad day, don't be afraid of me
EvilSamuraiess: your bad days must be like the holocaust.
BrianJCullinan: lol
EvilSamuraiess: well, i'm tired.
BrianJCullinan: me too
EvilSamuraiess: i'll see you tomorrow, then.
EvilSamuraiess: bye
BrianJCullinan: i'll miss you
EvilSamuraiess: well, it's only a few hours.
EvilSamuraiess: see ya.
BrianJCullinan: bye
BrianJCullinan: good night
BrianJCullinan: sleep tight
BrianJCullinan: while i have another shitty dream

BrianJCullinan: well, i'm here if you would like to talk
EvilSamuraiess: no, don't really feel like being social.
BrianJCullinan: ok, then i'll just be here talking to my computer waiting for you to join society again
EvilSamuraiess: i hope it keeps good company.
BrianJCullinan: not really, just proves that i'm an f-ing nerd, and i have no life
EvilSamuraiess: oh, well, i get that a lot too. my life revolves around speech and debate.
BrianJCullinan: good stuff
BrianJCullinan: i'm cold

EvilSamuraiess: i'll miss my mommy so much.
BrianJCullinan: awww
EvilSamuraiess: but i can't go to medical school without college, so whatever
BrianJCullinan: i will to, but i'll be able to start new relationships, and erase my past from memory like i did when i moved here
EvilSamuraiess: i have so much love and happiness in my memories. i wouldn't want them gone.
EvilSamuraiess: yeah, there's pain, but it's worth it. you learn from it.
BrianJCullinan: not for me
BrianJCullinan: and after collage i'm moving to a secluded place in canada
EvilSamuraiess: only because you won't let the good come out.
BrianJCullinan: canadians are cleaner the americans
EvilSamuraiess: canadians scare me. i'm going to move to iceland with my friend andrew.
BrianJCullinan: you know, you're different online too
EvilSamuraiess: how so?
BrianJCullinan: at school you're always really happy to talk to me, and now it seems like you don't really care
EvilSamuraiess: um, after last night...i'm kinda uncomfortable talking with you.
BrianJCullinan: how come?
BrianJCullinan: afraid of me because i had a shitty long day?... still?
EvilSamuraiess: you made me feel uncomfortable.
EvilSamuraiess: that's all that matters.
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: i don'
BrianJCullinan: t understand how i did it
BrianJCullinan: so how can i make up for it?
EvilSamuraiess: just let things get back to normal.
BrianJCullinan: so you don't want to talk to me?
EvilSamuraiess: i don't mind talking with you, just don't expect me to be as open and happy about it.
BrianJCullinan: ok, when you feel like telling me how i scared you away please do because i'm only a guy and i'm a little confused

EvilSamuraiess: some of the things you said reminded me of some bad memories, just the tone and the message....it's a girl thing. i can't explain it. it just hit home.
*** Auto-response sent to EvilSamuraiess: I am currently away from the computer.
BrianJCullinan: well then maybe we shouldn't talk online because you can't hear the tone of voice
EvilSamuraiess: maybe.
BrianJCullinan: because if you could hear my tone, i'm sure you would have been more open
EvilSamuraiess: i don't know.
BrianJCullinan: we always got along at school, why not now?  We talked so much before, why not now?
EvilSamuraiess: you just seem different.
BrianJCullinan: i'm not, i'm more fun now
BrianJCullinan: i like to spend money
