[03/03/2005 10:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: no torrents ever has viri
[03/03/2005 10:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: because torrents are divided up into tiny little pieces

[03/03/2005 10:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: torrents are different from actual files
[03/03/2005 10:37 PM] Andy: yeah
[03/03/2005 10:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: you will open the torrent file in these programs and it will start downloading
[03/03/2005 10:37 PM] Andy: dont they just download all the tiny files into one executable?
[03/03/2005 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[03/03/2005 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: but the torrents just have the settings for the files you are downloading
[03/03/2005 10:38 PM] Andy: ahh
[03/03/2005 10:38 PM] BrianJCullinan: tells it where the master server is and how big it is and how many files there are and all that stuff
[03/03/2005 10:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: so the torrent files are only a couple K
[03/03/2005 10:40 PM] Andy: ah

[03/03/2005 10:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: programming tools
[03/03/2005 10:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: you can pretty much open and edit any file ever created
[03/03/2005 10:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: either through the editors or through hex
[03/03/2005 10:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: its amazing

[03/03/2005 10:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i don't have that version
[03/03/2005 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: the person that was supplying that torrent missed used the archiver and put each file in a different .zip file
[03/03/2005 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: that fucking moron
[03/03/2005 10:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it was slower
