[10/26/2005 10:29 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i need to vent/get a guys opinion on something if you got a sec
[10/26/2005 10:39 PM] Me: hey
[10/26/2005 10:39 PM] Me: whats up?
[10/26/2005 10:39 PM] Me: sorry i took so long i was watching TV
[10/26/2005 10:39 PM] Colleen Cullinan: ive been dating this guy for 6 months...and lately he seems to be really into his work...so all we talk about is his job and what kind of sales he made that particular day (he sells timeshare btw)....and i hardly ever get to see him NEmore because his work schedule and my class schedule dont match up....so i'm feeling kinda neglected....but i try not to think too much of it because its neither his nor my fault...but tonight when i hung up the phone with him i said "bye. i love you" (which is the normal goodbye for us) and tonight he replied "mmm bye"...and i dont want to read too much into it...or be a pain in the ass about it, but if i dont say NEthing about it, i'm going to go nuts....i'm just afraid that if i say something about it he's going to feel like i'm some clingy little bitch who wants more attention.....
[10/26/2005 10:40 PM] Colleen Cullinan: its ok
[10/26/2005 10:41 PM] Me: its ok?
[10/26/2005 10:41 PM] Me: no actually its not
[10/26/2005 10:41 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i meant its ok as in...its ok you took so long 
[10/26/2005 10:41 PM] Me: if he was really into you which i don't know why he wouldn't be because you are incredible (you're a cullinan) he should be making time for you
[10/26/2005 10:42 PM] Colleen Cullinan: because you are incredible (you're a cullinan) (teehee)
[10/26/2005 10:42 PM] Me: the goodbye tonight it definitely a sign that he wants out of it, and i know it hurts, it always hurts, but don't torture yourself any longer because it will only get harder
[10/26/2005 10:42 PM] Me: you have to get rid of him, you deserve more
[10/26/2005 10:43 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i know....its hard to tho because im living at home now...and moms a nazi when it comes to curfew (yes i have one) on week nights
[10/26/2005 10:43 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i figured this much...but at the same time i dont want it to be one of those "i'm really stressed out and forgot" kind of situations...or he was distracted and didnt hear me say "i love you"
[10/26/2005 10:43 PM] Colleen Cullinan: cuz thats happened to me before...and i def. didnt mean NEthing by it
[10/26/2005 10:44 PM] Me: i know, that sucks too, but he should be making time for you, if he really wanted to be around you he would take a day or two off and do nothing but spend time with you
[10/26/2005 10:44 PM] Me: well i would give it a few more days maybe it was just an accident, but if the situation doesn't inprove definitely cut it off
[10/26/2005 10:45 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i just hate being an annoyance about things like this...it makes me feel like my nagging mother
[10/26/2005 10:46 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i think thats the reason why i have a lot of guys wanting to date me (not to brag *grins*)  but i tend to be the gf that doesnt turn the guy pussy whipped....and they appreciate that
[10/26/2005 10:46 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i mean...i'm not one to tell my bf how to live his life...(like many of my other friends do)
[10/26/2005 10:46 PM] Me: well you're definitely gonna be your nagging mother, but until then you should be having fun, and stressing out about a relationship with some guy doesn't seem very fun
[10/26/2005 10:46 PM] Colleen Cullinan: a big fuck you to the beginning of that comment *laughs*
[10/26/2005 10:46 PM] Colleen Cullinan: but yeah...i get what you're saying
[10/26/2005 10:47 PM] Me: lol
[10/26/2005 10:47 PM] Me: don't worry about it, it'll figure its self out
[10/26/2005 10:47 PM] Colleen Cullinan: i'd rather not be my nagging mother and have the temp. of my dad
[10/26/2005 10:47 PM] Me: you'll find another guy if it comes to that
[10/26/2005 10:47 PM] Colleen Cullinan: cuz cullinans are chill...and i want to be chill
[10/26/2005 10:48 PM] Colleen Cullinan: *sigh* well...you made me feel a whole lot better....
