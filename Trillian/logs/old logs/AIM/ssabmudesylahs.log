[24/10/2004 08:57 PM] Shalyse: why have u been wierd lately??
[24/10/2004 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: because i don't think we should go out anymore
[24/10/2004 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: i didn't want to say this online because i think that's kind of lame
[24/10/2004 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: but you asked, so here it is
[24/10/2004 09:01 PM] Shalyse: why do u think that?
[24/10/2004 09:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: we kind of rushed into things, and i just don't think we are right for eachother
[24/10/2004 09:02 PM] Shalyse: how so?
[24/10/2004 09:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: but i don't want you to be upset, i will always think how incredible of person you are, you know i have a high oppinion of you
[24/10/2004 09:02 PM] Shalyse: opposites attract
[24/10/2004 09:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just think we are very different, even though we have band in common
[24/10/2004 09:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: and its hard to spend time together when you work a lot and have a lot of stuff going on in your life, i just think it would be better if we were friends
[24/10/2004 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't want you to be upset
[24/10/2004 09:04 PM] Shalyse: i just think you think that way cuz i haven't been able to talk on the phone too much but i was willing to at times but you wanted to go but if you feel that way ok
[24/10/2004 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's why i didn't say this yestarday because i was so worried about hurting your feelings
[24/10/2004 09:04 PM] Shalyse: i mean i thought things could be fine if we just talked more and you settled for seeing me sometimes for only an hour or two
[24/10/2004 09:05 PM] Shalyse: but u can't do that it has to be longer
[24/10/2004 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know, but we have completely separate lives and there will always be that awkwardness
[24/10/2004 09:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: like i said, you have a lot going on in your life, you don't need me
[24/10/2004 09:06 PM] Shalyse: not really...i mean the last time we really hung out was at homecoming and i had fun
[24/10/2004 09:06 PM] Shalyse: but i want you
[24/10/2004 09:06 PM] Shalyse: but whatever
[24/10/2004 09:06 PM] BrianJCullinan: are you upset?
[24/10/2004 09:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: please don't be hurt, you're an incredible person, you deserve someone that better meets your needs, someone that can be around more often
[24/10/2004 09:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just can't do this anymore
[24/10/2004 09:08 PM] Shalyse: well what i am i suppose to be...i understand that you think relationships are suppose to be all perfect and everything and there isn't differences but thats not that case...and its not soo much be around more ofter either cuz if i was going out with someone else it would be the same
[24/10/2004 09:08 PM] Shalyse: can'
[24/10/2004 09:08 PM] Shalyse: can't*??
[24/10/2004 09:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry
[24/10/2004 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i didn't want to have to tell you like this, but i figured the sooner i said this the sooner you could get on with your life
[24/10/2004 09:10 PM] Shalyse: i guess you can go look for your "perfect" relationship and always be dissappointed cuz u won't find it...and yea i didn't say i love you back to you cuz it scared me when you said it, i didn't know what to think 
[24/10/2004 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know
[24/10/2004 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: i meant i loved you as a person
[24/10/2004 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's not what this is about
[24/10/2004 09:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just don't like having a girlfriend
[24/10/2004 09:11 PM] Shalyse: sure...
[24/10/2004 09:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: there is to much obligation
[24/10/2004 09:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: come on, you know i wouldn't lie to you
[24/10/2004 09:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: don't be upset, i don't want to hurt your feelings

[24/10/2004 09:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: i still like you, i just don't like having a girlfriend that's all
[24/10/2004 09:12 PM] Shalyse: yea u say that but i can bet a million dollars you won't hang out with me again
[24/10/2004 09:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's not true
