[03/14/2006 08:42 PM] Robert Douglas: do you have any php/mysql projects that you can show me?
[03/14/2006 08:43 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, the website i do my business through is (Link: http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com)www.mrbobswebdesign.com
[03/14/2006 08:55 PM] Me: Yes i have websites i can show you, but they are out of date.
[03/14/2006 08:55 PM] Me: Is that your website?
[03/14/2006 08:55 PM] Robert Douglas: anything is better than nothing
[03/14/2006 08:55 PM] Robert Douglas: yes it is
[03/14/2006 08:56 PM] Me: It is a very nice website
[03/14/2006 08:56 PM] Robert Douglas: thanks, I spent quite a bit of time just on the template and xhtml/css portion
[03/14/2006 08:56 PM] Me: yes i would say, it looks complex
[03/14/2006 08:58 PM] Me: how large is your team?
[03/14/2006 08:58 PM] Robert Douglas: everything? or web design?
[03/14/2006 08:58 PM] Me: both
[03/14/2006 08:59 PM] Robert Douglas: web design is 3, hosting is around 6-8
[03/14/2006 08:59 PM] Me: i already have a description on my recent websites, what e-mail should i send them to?
[03/14/2006 08:59 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: mailto:mrbob@mrbobswebdesign.com)mrbob@mrbobswebdesign.com
[03/14/2006 09:01 PM] Me: understand that my front end could use a lot of improvement on most of those sites, however the PHP script is pretty dynamic and efficient
[03/14/2006 09:02 PM] Robert Douglas: alright, i'll check them out
[03/14/2006 09:04 PM] Me: so what other kind of work do you do?
[03/14/2006 09:06 PM] Robert Douglas: template design, xhtml/css coding , business cards, logos, banners, stationary
[03/14/2006 09:06 PM] Me: where are the servers hosted?
[03/14/2006 09:07 PM] Robert Douglas: servers are colo in One Wilshire out in LA
[03/14/2006 09:08 PM] Robert Douglas: just put a new one up tonight :) 4 74gb raptors in raid 10, dual opteron 246, 4gb ram, 400gb drive for backups
[03/14/2006 09:08 PM] Me: noice
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Me: did you start all of this?
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, awhile ago
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Me: this is amazing
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Robert Douglas: that server is going to KICK ASS
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Me: what type of server?
[03/14/2006 09:09 PM] Robert Douglas: we just added a new bandwidth provider
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Robert Douglas: custom built server
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Me: is it a linux?
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Me: or windows?
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Me: or apache?
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Robert Douglas: centos
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Robert Douglas: now we have mzima AND savvis for bandwidth
[03/14/2006 09:10 PM] Me: interestings
[03/14/2006 09:11 PM] Me: how is the front page extensions installed on that?
[03/14/2006 09:11 PM] Robert Douglas: a nice piece of hardware will now determine which provider will have the least amount of hops between the server and your connection, and then use that, does it all on the fly
[03/14/2006 09:11 PM] Me: nice
[03/14/2006 09:11 PM] Robert Douglas: it is the same build from RTR
[03/14/2006 09:12 PM] Me: why are you in CS 126?
[03/14/2006 09:12 PM] Robert Douglas: I am a CS major
[03/14/2006 09:12 PM] Me: it seems like you have plently of experience in the field
[03/14/2006 09:12 PM] Me: you're not a freshman are you?
[03/14/2006 09:13 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, I am Junior, I went to a high school that let me take college credits, so I graduated high school with 60 credits, basically halfway done with my degree
[03/14/2006 09:13 PM] Me: wow
[03/14/2006 09:13 PM] Me: that is amazing
[03/14/2006 09:13 PM] Me: how are you doing in CS class?
[03/14/2006 09:14 PM] Robert Douglas: 80%
[03/14/2006 09:14 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty sad, I just haven't put time into it
[03/14/2006 09:14 PM] Robert Douglas: what about you?
[03/14/2006 09:14 PM] Me: but the programming is easy for you?  what languages do you know?
[03/14/2006 09:15 PM] Robert Douglas: I've done a year of C++, semested of VB.net, and learned PHP on my own
[03/14/2006 09:15 PM] Robert Douglas: programming is really simple, I just find the way Java does things a lot harder than C++/VB.net
[03/14/2006 09:16 PM] Robert Douglas: the logic I have down 100%, it is just knowing the syntax for java
[03/14/2006 09:16 PM] Me: interesting
[03/14/2006 09:16 PM] Me: so did you look at my websites?
[03/14/2006 09:16 PM] Robert Douglas: I enjoyed VB.net a lot, i actually wrote a couple programs for doing your calculation checks for chem 151 lab
[03/14/2006 09:16 PM] Me: nice
[03/14/2006 09:17 PM] Robert Douglas: opened them, haven't had a look yet
[03/14/2006 09:17 PM] Robert Douglas: did you write that JS for the expand/collapse menu?
[03/14/2006 09:18 PM] Me: that was the only thing, all the hovers is done with CSS
[03/14/2006 09:19 PM] Me: i know Java, Javascript, VB <5, Vb.net, some C++, PHP, some PERL, SQL, all my coding i do in HTML although i use Dreamweaver because i like the file management, I have experience with forums, and mediawiki which would be a great service to add to your scripts
[03/14/2006 09:20 PM] Robert Douglas: I haven't heard of mediawiki before
[03/14/2006 09:21 PM] Me: I have always kept my websites simple, i enjoy the dynamic and unfixed window size, i believe that unfortunately people are still using older resolution monitors, so i have always kept the pages completely sizable
[03/14/2006 09:21 PM] Me: mediawiki is the wikipedia service
[03/14/2006 09:22 PM] Me: wikis are becoming increasingly popular i think, now every game development site is switching from standard forums to wikis
[03/14/2006 09:23 PM] Robert Douglas: wiki.org?
[03/14/2006 09:23 PM] Me: mediawiki.org
[03/14/2006 09:24 PM] Me: so if i were to become apart of your team what kind of work would this job entail?
[03/14/2006 09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: the main area of focus would be custom php/mysql
[03/14/2006 09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: such as integrating a CMS into a current website, building a custom application
[03/14/2006 09:27 PM] Robert Douglas: last year, a friend and I submitted our business plan to the fortune 500 small business plan competition and won some $$ for it, that business plan is for a new company that is going to focus on large companies in non-niche markets
[03/14/2006 09:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so we are going to have our own custom application for dealerships, law firms, etc.
[03/14/2006 09:28 PM] Me: interesting
[03/14/2006 09:28 PM] Me: would i be the only person working on the CMS project, or will there be another team for that as well?
[03/14/2006 09:29 PM] Robert Douglas: you would be working by yourself, or with one other person named Prashant
[03/14/2006 09:29 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.botnick.rp-s.com)http://www.botnick.rp-s.com
[03/14/2006 09:30 PM] Me: is that one of the companies that needs CMS?
[03/14/2006 09:30 PM] Robert Douglas: I'm just about done with all static pages, template design and logo (that still has the old ugly logo on it) are finished, just getting ready to install the auto dealership program so they can display their new/pre-owned vehicles
[03/14/2006 09:31 PM] Robert Douglas: and yes, that is one site that needs a CMS, everything under (Link: http://www.botnick.rp-s.com/About-Botnick/)http://www.botnick.rp-s.com/About-Botnick/ will need to be dynamic, so they can log into an admin side and update content
[03/14/2006 09:34 PM] Robert Douglas: however, we already have someone working on that
[03/14/2006 09:34 PM] Me: this sounds like a very small job, updating information would be simple.  could you elaborate a little more on future projects, that would possibly be on a larger scale?  are you looking for a sort of scheme that each project will fit in order to provide the customer with generic specifications?  or will each project be specific to each customer?
[03/14/2006 09:34 PM] Robert Douglas: I don't need you for anything this week, but we plan on doing a couple projects per week starting next month
[03/14/2006 09:35 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll have a custom designed dealership script that will be specific to that industry
[03/14/2006 09:36 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be flexible enough so we wouldnt have to constantly change it for each client
[03/14/2006 09:36 PM] Me: interesting, so i assume it will not only be for contact information but for managing larger scale databases like for displaying each car and its specs?
[03/14/2006 09:37 PM] Me: like you would need a database for preowned vehicles and new vehicles correct?
[03/14/2006 09:37 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://daveimelmotors.com/ab-listings.php)http://daveimelmotors.com/ab-listings.php
[03/14/2006 09:38 PM] Robert Douglas: that's an example of what we would need
[03/14/2006 09:38 PM] Robert Douglas: a designer will create the template, xhtml programmer will take care of coding it, then the project manager will put it together to show example functionality, then a programmer will come in and code it
[03/14/2006 09:39 PM] Me: ah, very nice, so once this database scheme is developed it shouldn't be hard to port to future business customers?
[03/14/2006 09:39 PM] Me: very nice i like that business plan
[03/14/2006 09:40 PM] Me: now do you plan to just manage car dealerships?  will you expand into other industries?
[03/14/2006 09:40 PM] Robert Douglas: it would need to be built so that it can connect to a server and auto update as we make changes to to code, the display will be 100% CSS based, so the code in the back can be encrypted, and we can auto update it knowing the client will not be able to make changes that cause an issue with the auto update
[03/14/2006 09:41 PM] Robert Douglas: we expect the development costs to be less than the cost of our first site that uses it, then, our sales managers will go to multiple dealerships, sell the product, and charge a monthly fee
[03/14/2006 09:41 PM] Robert Douglas: car dealerships are our start, we have a couple law firms lined up as well, and will progress as we find more leads
[03/14/2006 09:43 PM] Me: this looks very promising, what kind of on the job training will you provide? i take it you're not going to run like microsoft with internal politics but instead share ideas and concepts as needed
[03/14/2006 09:44 PM] Robert Douglas: we use the worlddo CRM for projects, ideas, tasks, and Cerberus Helpdesk for communication
[03/14/2006 09:44 PM] Robert Douglas: we're writing policies right now so people like you will know exactly what to do
[03/14/2006 09:45 PM] Robert Douglas: everything you do will be from a word doc that lists the protocal
[03/14/2006 09:45 PM] Robert Douglas: protocol
[03/14/2006 09:46 PM] Me: ok
[03/14/2006 09:47 PM] Me: i would really like to join your team, would it be possible for you to provide me with a sample of what i will need to provide a connection between the interface and the database?
[03/14/2006 09:48 PM] Robert Douglas: for designing an application such as the one for a dealership
[03/14/2006 09:48 PM] Robert Douglas: ?
[03/14/2006 09:48 PM] Me: yes
[03/14/2006 09:49 PM] Me: and could i also see the type of work the current developer for the contact information is doing?
[03/14/2006 09:49 PM] Robert Douglas: it isn't going to run from a dedicated database server, it is all going to be isntalled on the hosting account, the database platform is mysql, and you would need to use php to connect to it- does that answer your question?
[03/14/2006 09:50 PM] Robert Douglas: I'm writing up the project details right now for the Botnick project, but once it is done I can gladly send it over
[03/14/2006 09:51 PM] Me: yes sort of, i guess i am just asking if i could see the work the current developer is doing, kind of form and learn the preferred style of programming you are looking for
[03/14/2006 09:51 PM] Me: wonderful, you have my e-mail address?
[03/14/2006 09:51 PM] Robert Douglas: yes I do, I'll be sending you a request for your information, such as your full name, phone, e-mail, aim/msn/etc, skills list, portfolio, and a few other things I can't think up
[03/14/2006 09:52 PM] Me: ok great, i will begin working on a more formal resume'
[03/14/2006 09:52 PM] Robert Douglas: then we'll get you setup as a contact in worlddo so i'll be able to contact you when we're ready
[03/14/2006 09:53 PM] Me: ok perfect
[03/14/2006 09:53 PM] Me: what kind of payment is involved?
[03/14/2006 09:54 PM] Robert Douglas: you'll be billed on a per project basis from our finance dept
[03/14/2006 09:55 PM] Me: billed or paid?
[03/14/2006 09:55 PM] Robert Douglas: paid, I'm sorry
[03/14/2006 09:55 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm writing up the specs for the new server so the admins can finish the config, as well as about 10 other things :P
[03/14/2006 09:56 PM] Me: had me worried i guess that would be acceptable if each employee was responsible for setting up their own contacts
[03/14/2006 09:56 PM] Robert Douglas: haha, yeah
[03/14/2006 09:56 PM] Robert Douglas: Merrill Lynch handles our payroll
[03/14/2006 09:56 PM] Me: sounds good
[03/14/2006 09:57 PM] Me: and what is the going pay rate these days?
[03/14/2006 09:58 PM] Robert Douglas: it all depends on what the project is, the main custom apps will pay pretty good
[03/14/2006 09:58 PM] Me: i would say what is most appealing about this job opportunity is the ability to work at your own pace within the deadline constraints obviously, would that be correct?
[03/14/2006 09:59 PM] Robert Douglas: that's right, however, you will be reporting to the project manager with a weekly update on what has been done, what is done, just to make sure everything is on the right track
[03/14/2006 09:59 PM] Robert Douglas: so if you fall behind, we will still be able to find someone to pick up the pace and still be able to deliver on time
[03/14/2006 10:00 PM] Me: understandable
[03/14/2006 10:00 PM] Me: i don't have any further questions so far, and i will be sending all of my information back to you, is there anything you'd like to ask me?
[03/14/2006 10:01 PM] Robert Douglas: how many hours per week can you work?
[03/14/2006 10:02 PM] Me: well i have a habit of doing my homework in the office of my current job working for resnet, so outside of that i could work anywhere from 15 to 30 hours
[03/14/2006 10:02 PM] Me: i have created entire websites in less time then that in the past so i don't think the extra workload will be any problem, i am more efficient when i am busy
[03/14/2006 10:03 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[03/14/2006 10:03 PM] Robert Douglas: that's all I have for now, in the next week or so you will  be receiving a form that you need to fill out that will contain all of your contact information
[03/14/2006 10:04 PM] Me: ok sounds great, thank you for the job opportunity, and i look forward to working with you
[03/14/2006 10:05 PM] Robert Douglas: glad to hear, take care Brian
[03/14/2006 10:05 PM] Me: yes you too Robert, see you in class tomorrow.

[03/16/2006 11:16 AM] Me: yeah i don't know man
[03/16/2006 11:16 AM] Robert Douglas: it is a pretty complex one this time

[03/24/2006 04:22 PM] Me: Hi
[03/24/2006 04:23 PM] Robert Douglas: hey
[03/24/2006 04:23 PM] Me: check out this site i am developing
[03/24/2006 04:23 PM] Me: (Link: http://bjcwmp.mine.nu)http://bjcwmp.mine.nu
[03/24/2006 04:23 PM] Me: the drag and drop doesn't work but the add button does
[03/24/2006 04:24 PM] Robert Douglas: that's pretty cool, are those all your MP3s?
[03/24/2006 04:24 PM] Me: yes
[03/24/2006 04:24 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like it is directly connected to your box too
[03/24/2006 04:25 PM] Me: how do you mean?
[03/24/2006 04:25 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://bjcwmp.mine.nu/main.php?folder=C%3A%5CDocuments+and+Settings%5CBrian+Cullinan%5CMy+Documents%5CMy+Music)http://bjcwmp.mine.nu/main.php?folder=C%3A%5CDocuments+and+Settings%5CBrian+Cullinan%5CMy+Documents%5CMy+Music
[03/24/2006 04:25 PM] Robert Douglas: the path runs from your box
[03/24/2006 04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: i haven't setup apache yet on my computer
[03/24/2006 04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs\bjcwmp
[03/24/2006 04:26 PM] Me: yeah i need to take out the first part of that and hide that path then add it back into the php when i need to access the folder
[03/24/2006 04:26 PM] Me: just for security reasons
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, cuz it gives your nau IP 134.114.111.119
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Me: how did you get my root folder?
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Me: what link was that in?
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: wasnt in a link
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Me: oh, how did you do that?
[03/24/2006 04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: apache usually has the max execution set to 30 secs, when there is an error because of that, it will display your root ;)
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Me: i mean i know of ways too, but i want to know my security vunerabilities
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so i just messed with the URL to find the full url
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Me: oh
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Robert Douglas: the full path*
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Me: smart man
[03/24/2006 04:28 PM] Me: i need to add handlers for my errors
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: you have a pretty good music collection tho
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Me: yeah its not finished yet, i need to get ride of my documents path, and i need to add drag and drop functionality, but you get the idea
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Me: when you click download it downloads a playlist
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: nothing compared to my 81,000.... but it is a start
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Me: not the actual music, then windows media play streams it
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Me: you have 81,000?
[03/24/2006 04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: that's smart
[03/24/2006 04:30 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, I have quite a bit
[03/24/2006 04:30 PM] Robert Douglas: you need to implement a search bar somewhere
[03/24/2006 04:31 PM] Me: yes
[03/24/2006 04:31 PM] Me: i was going to do that
[03/24/2006 04:31 PM] Me: should be alright
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://134.114.111.119/nauexploit/)http://134.114.111.119/nauexploit/
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: lol
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: yes
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: makes me a little curious haha
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: its my wiki
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: it doesn't show up properly from that link
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: not sure if i still have that domain registered
[03/24/2006 04:32 PM] Me: all of them are .mine.nu
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i noticed they offer dns forwarding
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Me: (Link: http://nauexploit.mine.nu/index.php?title=Main_Page)http://nauexploit.mine.nu/index.php?title=Main_Page
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Me: that one still is there
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Robert Douglas: haha
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Robert Douglas: no articles though
[03/24/2006 04:33 PM] Me: yeah there is one
[03/24/2006 04:34 PM] Me: type networking into the search
[03/24/2006 04:34 PM] Robert Douglas: man, CAA is a biatch
[03/24/2006 04:34 PM] Me: yeah a stupid bitch
[03/24/2006 04:34 PM] Me: that how i can get around it
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Robert Douglas: a good article you could use is how to hide your actual mac addy
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Robert Douglas: just run your laptop through your desktop
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Robert Douglas: or the other way
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Robert Douglas: and only one has to be registered
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Me: good idea
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Me: some NICs come with a changer for it
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Me: change your mac to your roommates
[03/24/2006 04:35 PM] Me: and spoof the server with every single byte
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what I am going to do with my desktop so my mac won't be reported, and if this BS ever happens again with me having to send in my comp, i can just send in the laptop
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Robert Douglas: that's a pretty good idea
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Me: yeah, what happened?
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Me: how come you had to take it in?
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Robert Douglas: they came back and said the prob was with Etheral!!!
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Robert Douglas: ethereal
[03/24/2006 04:36 PM] Me: whats that?
[03/24/2006 04:37 PM] Robert Douglas: i send over weekly logs to my admin
[03/24/2006 04:37 PM] Robert Douglas: it is a program that displays all traffic on yoiur NIC
[03/24/2006 04:37 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.ethereal.com/)http://www.ethereal.com/
[03/24/2006 04:37 PM] Me: yeah how come you do that?
[03/24/2006 04:37 PM] Robert Douglas: make sure nothing is coming in that I should have, so I can setup my FW to block it
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Robert Douglas: i haven't EVER had a single virus or spyware on this computer
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Me: yeah i just use sygate
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Robert Douglas: sygate is good
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Me: do they analyze it for you too?
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Robert Douglas: ZA Pro blocks CAA pretty nice
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, I just send over my log file and they come back saying if th ere are any issues
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Me: sygate blocks their port scans and tells me about it
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Robert Douglas: I just got my new server setup, and I plan to tunnel through VPN over SSL
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Robert Douglas: so all my stuff is 100% encrypted
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Me: so that's always nice, but i am behind a router most the time so i don't have to put up with anything
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Me: yeah that would be cool
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Me: hey do you have an interface for your music?
[03/24/2006 04:39 PM] Robert Douglas: it was supposed to be setup a few days ago, but i was just too busy
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Robert Douglas: nah
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont share it, because not all of it is legal
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: i would suggest we can set up that apache server and i'll give you this site
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Robert Douglas: i have 39gb left on a 400gb drive
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: then YOU can access it anywhere
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: i am going to password protect mine when i finish it
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, thats a good idea
[03/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: yeah i have a 400GB, just 1, and i still have 100GB
[03/24/2006 04:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i dont really need my music on the go at all, what I would like to do is setup a windows util that will zip an entire DVD, then FTP it over to my server, so I can watch that when I am away from the comp
[03/24/2006 04:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i have four 74gb 10krpm raptors. a 400gb, three 250s, and two 300s
[03/24/2006 04:42 PM] Robert Douglas: when I do a reformat on the comp I will swap out the 4x74 raptors for 2x150 raptors
[03/24/2006 04:42 PM] Me: yeah in the office they didn't like that you unplugged your stuff
[03/24/2006 04:42 PM] Me: so they automatically assumed you were doing something illegal
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, I told them what was on it, i said I have 150 dvds
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Robert Douglas: but they insisted that they scan it anyways
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Me: but don't be mad at melissa, she doesn't have anything against you
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Robert Douglas: ah no, Melissa was cool
[03/24/2006 04:43 PM] Robert Douglas: Laural was the one...
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: yeah, she thinks your angry because she had to be a bitch on the phone
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Robert Douglas: she just had a bad attitude
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: it wasn't laurel either, they are just doing their job
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: like i said they assumed you were doing something illegal
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Robert Douglas: i called the head of the ACHD and told him that Melissa was doing a really good job
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: laurel is actually a really awesome person
[03/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:45 PM] Robert Douglas: if they would have provided me with more information about what "bad things" were going on, i could have figured out what was causing the problem
[03/24/2006 04:45 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i understand they have to be sure that everytthing in clean, I 100% agree with that- it keeps people like me safe
[03/24/2006 04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: but they should have been able to allow me to scan it in my dorm, and then i just show them the finished report of the scan
[03/24/2006 04:47 PM] Me: well just don't hold any grudges i know if i was in your position i would be highly annoyed, but its not even our department that decides who is doing bad stuff and who isn't all we do if put up with the bullshit
[03/24/2006 04:47 PM] Robert Douglas: nobody really realized how much of a pain it was for me to be down for 3 days, and how much $$ I lost from each day
[03/24/2006 04:47 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i understand
[03/24/2006 04:47 PM] Me: ITS decides who stays and who goes
[03/24/2006 04:48 PM] Robert Douglas: everyone was pretty cool about it, I am glad it is all over with now
[03/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i also have my desktop with two mac addys, so they were wondering about that too
[03/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i just run a MB that happens to support two
[03/24/2006 04:49 PM] Me: yeah same here
[03/24/2006 04:50 PM] Robert Douglas: Ethereal is actually pretty sweet if you need to know what's going on
[03/24/2006 04:50 PM] Robert Douglas: if someone tries to port scan you, I will know
[03/24/2006 04:50 PM] Me: that's cool
[03/24/2006 04:50 PM] Robert Douglas: it will show the u/p for when you FTP without SSL
[03/24/2006 04:51 PM] Robert Douglas: all AIM convos since aim is unencrypted
[03/24/2006 04:51 PM] Me: yeah
[03/24/2006 04:51 PM] Robert Douglas: MSN encrypts their convo, so cant really do much about those
[03/24/2006 04:53 PM] Robert Douglas: any idea why nau blocks TCP/UDP
[03/24/2006 04:53 PM] Robert Douglas: so you cant run a tracert
[03/24/2006 04:55 PM] Me: NOT SURE
[03/24/2006 04:55 PM] Me: oops
[03/24/2006 04:55 PM] Me: not sure
[03/24/2006 04:55 PM] Robert Douglas: its always a pain in the ass when i need to see if a domain resolved

[03/30/2006 11:55 PM] Robert Douglas: Are you around?
[03/30/2006 11:55 PM] Me: yeah
[03/30/2006 11:56 PM] Me: whats up?
[03/30/2006 11:56 PM] Robert Douglas: I have a small php/mysql job, want me to send over the specs?
[03/30/2006 11:56 PM] Robert Douglas: It needs to be completed by the end of this weekend.
[03/30/2006 11:56 PM] Me: uhh sure
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] Me: i will be out for some of this weekend but i should have enough time
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] *** Robert Douglas is trying to send you "php-mysql-specs.doc".
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] Me: you will have to e-mail it
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] Me: Trillian sucks like that
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] Me: b.cullinan@cox.net
[03/30/2006 11:57 PM] Robert Douglas: I would just do it myself if I didn't have a meeting this weekend :/
[03/30/2006 11:58 PM] Me: yeah
[03/30/2006 11:58 PM] Me: will you send it over e-mail?
[03/30/2006 11:58 PM] Robert Douglas: sure, sec
[03/31/2006 12:01 AM] Robert Douglas: Alright, send it over
[03/31/2006 12:02 AM] Robert Douglas: I'll have the frontend/admin designed, so keep that in mind.
[03/31/2006 12:03 AM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 12:03 AM] Me: i hope i can figure out what exactly you are expecting, you didn't send me any samples of previous projects
[03/31/2006 12:04 AM] Robert Douglas: It should be pretty clear in the .doc
[03/31/2006 12:06 AM] Robert Douglas: I'll have the admin coded in xhtml/css, and give example output on the customer side. The only stuff I need is the functionality created between the customer/admin side.
[03/31/2006 12:06 AM] Me: do you want notation?
[03/31/2006 12:06 AM] Robert Douglas: such as comments within the php?
[03/31/2006 12:07 AM] Me: yes
[03/31/2006 12:07 AM] Robert Douglas: they aren't needed, but helpful if we ever have you improve on it at a later date
[03/31/2006 12:07 AM] Robert Douglas: the script shouldn't be a resource hog, we don't expect to have more than a few thousand page views per day
[03/31/2006 12:10 AM] Me: do i need to include create tables?
[03/31/2006 12:10 AM] Robert Douglas: the entire myswl db will need to be created
[03/31/2006 12:10 AM] Robert Douglas: sql*
[03/31/2006 12:10 AM] Me: so these sections are separate from what you already have?
[03/31/2006 12:11 AM] Robert Douglas: what do you mean?
[03/31/2006 12:11 AM] Me: or would you like me to connect to a current database, but makes new tables
[03/31/2006 12:11 AM] Robert Douglas: no mysql db exists
[03/31/2006 12:12 AM] Robert Douglas: you need to create the entire db layout
[03/31/2006 12:12 AM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 12:17 AM] Me: oh one more thing
[03/31/2006 12:17 AM] Robert Douglas: ok
[03/31/2006 12:17 AM] Me: do i need to do user management for the admin section?
[03/31/2006 12:18 AM] Robert Douglas: nope, it will just be one login 
[03/31/2006 12:18 AM] Robert Douglas: one user to access the admin
[03/31/2006 12:18 AM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 12:20 AM] Me: i will start this first thing in the morning
[03/31/2006 12:21 AM] Robert Douglas: i need a quote
[03/31/2006 12:21 AM] Robert Douglas: then I have to pass it along to the head project manager to get approval
[03/31/2006 12:21 AM] Me: a quote?
[03/31/2006 12:21 AM] Robert Douglas: yeah, how much is this going to cost?
[03/31/2006 12:22 AM] Me: i don't know, i guess 10 hours
[03/31/2006 12:22 AM] Me: how much are you usually paid hourly?
[03/31/2006 12:22 AM] Me: $35?
[03/31/2006 12:22 AM] Robert Douglas: anywhere from $20-$150
[03/31/2006 12:23 AM] Me: i usually charge $35
[03/31/2006 12:23 AM] Me: i think it will probably take me 10 hours
[03/31/2006 12:24 AM] Me: its really six pages if you include the admin
[03/31/2006 12:24 AM] Robert Douglas: Should be 3 client side pages, 3 admin pages, and 1 admin login page.
[03/31/2006 12:25 AM] Me: yeah but also an install script for the database
[03/31/2006 12:25 AM] Me: so does that price sound fair?
[03/31/2006 12:25 AM] Robert Douglas: It sounds reasonable, I got another quote for $325.
[03/31/2006 12:26 AM] Robert Douglas: But that doesn't mean $25 is going to make the decision
[03/31/2006 12:26 AM] Me: ok let me know if you need anything else, i think i am going to sleep now
[03/31/2006 12:26 AM] Robert Douglas: alright, I'll get this info sent to the head project manager tonight and hear back tomorrow. I am waiting for one other person to give his quote and then we will know for usre.
[03/31/2006 12:27 AM] Robert Douglas: sure *
[03/31/2006 12:27 AM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 12:27 AM] Robert Douglas: good night
[03/31/2006 12:27 AM] Me: goodnight
Session Close (Robert Douglas): Fri Mar 31 00:30:51 2006


Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Robert Douglas): Fri Mar 31 19:26:22 2006
[03/31/2006 07:26 PM] Me: Hey
[03/31/2006 07:26 PM] Robert Douglas: hey
[03/31/2006 07:26 PM] Me: i have some of the site done
[03/31/2006 07:26 PM] Me: meeting the specs
[03/31/2006 07:26 PM] Robert Douglas: Why? I told you last night that I need to talk to the head project manager...
[03/31/2006 07:27 PM] Me: but if i only have this weekend
[03/31/2006 07:27 PM] Me: that's not much time
[03/31/2006 07:27 PM] Robert Douglas: Yeah I know, but I don't want to you to go ahead and work with the possible chance of not getting paid for it.
[03/31/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: That would ruin any future relationship
[03/31/2006 07:28 PM] Me: well i finished one page, so if i am getting paid it will be easy to convert it over to meet the specs on the other pages
[03/31/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: The final choice comes down to the head project manager, with regards to who is going ot be hired
[03/31/2006 07:28 PM] Me: and its good experience for me anyways
[03/31/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: ok cool
[03/31/2006 07:29 PM] Robert Douglas: I'll send a msg to the HPM and let him know you were already able to start it, it might bump you up a bit.
[03/31/2006 07:29 PM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 07:29 PM] Me: 10 digit phone number right?
[03/31/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[03/31/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: (xxx) xxx-xxxx
[03/31/2006 07:30 PM] Me: k
[03/31/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: all that will need is a simple echo $phone
[03/31/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: they will format it themselves
[03/31/2006 07:31 PM] Me: ok
[03/31/2006 07:31 PM] Robert Douglas: It would be way too much work to parse what they enter into a specific format, if they are too dumb to make it look nice, they shouldn't have a job
[03/31/2006 07:33 PM] Me: nah not too hard
[03/31/2006 07:34 PM] Me: so did you offer this project to other people too?
[03/31/2006 07:35 PM] Me: may i show you what i have so far?
[03/31/2006 07:35 PM] Me: just to make sure its what you are expecting
[03/31/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: I sent the project out to two people, one who I planned on going with, and then you since I thought at the last minute this would be a pretty good starting project
[03/31/2006 07:36 PM] Me: yeah
[03/31/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: I have to take off for a meeting tonight, but I should be back in <2 hours. Then I have another one tomorrow morning around 10am
[03/31/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: I'll send you a msg when I get back and see if you are still around.
[03/31/2006 07:36 PM] Me: ok i probably will be
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: If you need a dev environment let me know and I can set you up with a test account on our new server.
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: uhh not sure what that means, i have dreamweaver
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: and PHP
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: if you need to test it on the server live
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: and SQL
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: yeah i have all that
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: i do need some more specs though
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: ok no prob
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Me: but we can talk later if you have to go now
[03/31/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: I will msg you when I get back
[03/31/2006 07:38 PM] Me: ok talk to you then

[04/04/2006 09:11 PM] Me: what is an IPO?

[04/07/2006 03:26 PM] Robert Douglas: you should think about hiding some stuff so people won't be able to steal it
[04/07/2006 03:27 PM] Robert Douglas: use php to handle the file output, and change the referrer to only allow the referrer to be your domain

[04/07/2006 03:50 PM] Me: i was just messing around with it
[04/07/2006 03:50 PM] Robert Douglas: the entire intro of how it loads is awesome
[04/07/2006 03:50 PM] Me: you mean put the actual login for inside lightbox
[04/07/2006 03:50 PM] Me: that's a good idea
[04/07/2006 03:51 PM] Me: can you md5 with javascript?
[04/07/2006 03:51 PM] Me: well i guess it wouldn't matter, maybe i can find a way to make the lightbox load an inline frame
[04/07/2006 03:51 PM] Me: then when you click login in that frame it will refer to a PHP page
[04/07/2006 03:52 PM] Robert Douglas: >> (Link: http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/index.html)http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/index.html
[04/07/2006 03:53 PM] Robert Douglas: however, i dont know if that is the 32 bit DES reversable hash
[04/07/2006 03:53 PM] Me: yeah i probably won't need that
[04/07/2006 03:53 PM] Me: i just want lightbox to load an inline frame

[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Me: there is an md5 crack?
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: even ie 5.5 does
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Me: yeah
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: somewhat, there is the 32 bit DES reversable hash
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: which is still MD5
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Me: wow
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: but also
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: there are these so called rainbow tables
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Me: yeah?
[04/07/2006 03:54 PM] Robert Douglas: around 600gbs of MD5 hashes

[04/07/2006 03:55 PM] Me: why is md5 irreversable ?
[04/07/2006 03:55 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://milw0rm.com/cracker/insert.php)http://milw0rm.com/cracker/insert.php
[04/07/2006 03:56 PM] Robert Douglas: it is a one way encryption, basically, when you check the value for the md5 hash, you never decrypt it to check it against the value you enter, you simply do the one way encrypt again,and compare the encrypted values
[04/07/2006 03:58 PM] Me: yes
[04/07/2006 04:03 PM] Me: so i am using cache on the server side
[04/07/2006 04:03 PM] Me: for the files that take a long time to load
[04/07/2006 04:04 PM] Me: like the navigation tree, it caches and html file instead of generating it every time
[04/07/2006 04:04 PM] Robert Douglas: ah, that's a good idea

[04/07/2006 04:04 PM] Robert Douglas: look in your phpinfo > (Link: http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/php-compression/)http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/php-compression/
[04/07/2006 04:04 PM] Me: and the main page that loads the id3 tags it makes a cache of those so it just sends the html instead of loading the tags every time
[04/07/2006 04:04 PM] Me: oh yeah i have done that
[04/07/2006 04:05 PM] Me: i downloaded a file manager that used zlib
[04/07/2006 04:05 PM] Robert Douglas: that's so quick on pure html
[04/07/2006 04:05 PM] Robert Douglas: nice
[04/07/2006 04:06 PM] Me: how does it work?
[04/07/2006 04:07 PM] Robert Douglas: no clue
[04/07/2006 04:07 PM] Robert Douglas: i just know it loads things up to about 80% faster
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Me: wow
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Me: i'll try it
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Robert Douglas: it sends the file compressed to the browser
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Robert Douglas: and then the browser decompresses it on the fly
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont know how that's done
[04/07/2006 04:08 PM] Me: so i added that tag to the cache page
[04/07/2006 04:09 PM] Me: so when it loads the cache page it cuts down on the time
[04/07/2006 04:09 PM] Me: just because my generation takes a long time, not necessarily the html loading
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Me: except with my navigation, that takes a long time any ways because its a big file, thanks for the tip
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to be on the topmost part of your code
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Me: yeah i did
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: I would place it right above the <html> tag
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Me: so the cache file refers to a php file with that in the top
[04/07/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never worked much with php & caching
[04/07/2006 04:11 PM] Me: so its like the php is creating a php page with that php command
[04/07/2006 04:11 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure how it handles everything
[04/07/2006 04:11 PM] Me: it really cuts down on generation times
[04/07/2006 04:11 PM] Me: i just do it because it has to search through ever single folder for files
[04/07/2006 04:11 PM] Me: it takes a while
[04/07/2006 04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: that makes sense
[04/07/2006 04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: so it just keeps it in a pool basically (the cache) so it doesn't have to find it each time
[04/07/2006 04:14 PM] Me: yes
[04/07/2006 04:15 PM] Me: it checks to see if it exists, if it does it just changes the header location, if it doesn't it saves the generated page in a cache folder, and then changes the header
[04/07/2006 04:33 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds pretty reliable
[04/07/2006 04:34 PM] Me: yeah it works out well i think
[04/07/2006 04:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i forgot, did you want me to set u up with a test server?
[04/07/2006 04:42 PM] Me: yeah i guess so, i have everything i need locally though
[04/07/2006 04:42 PM] Me: i have sql 4.1 and 5.0 and the latest php
[04/07/2006 04:42 PM] Robert Douglas: well if u wont use it i wont make it
[04/07/2006 04:43 PM] Me: i probably won't use it much
[04/07/2006 04:43 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[04/07/2006 04:46 PM] Robert Douglas: do you have an eye for design?
[04/07/2006 04:47 PM] Me: how do you mean?

[04/07/2006 04:51 PM] Me: what template?

[04/07/2006 04:56 PM] Robert Douglas: there will be a navigation box on the left side (where there is that huge blank space)
[04/07/2006 04:56 PM] Me: i think it looks like
[04/07/2006 04:56 PM] Me: i love those curvy corners
[04/07/2006 04:56 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to try and put a glossy effect on the  header
[04/07/2006 04:57 PM] Me: yeah that should look nice
[04/07/2006 04:57 PM] Me: personally though i would make that just as curvy
[04/07/2006 04:57 PM] Robert Douglas: the header?
[04/07/2006 04:58 PM] Me: yes
[04/07/2006 04:58 PM] Robert Douglas: ok
[04/07/2006 04:59 PM] Me: ok

[04/09/2006 10:40 PM] Me: its coming along pretty well
[04/09/2006 10:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, but the wireless on campus still goes through one of your Mac addresses, so they still can red flag you for stupid things that are meaningless
[04/09/2006 10:40 PM] Me: i just have a lot of distractions
[04/09/2006 10:40 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, np
[04/09/2006 10:40 PM] Robert Douglas: the nice thing about the wireless is that if you set it up through a router, you only need to add one mac adress

[04/09/2006 10:42 PM] Me: lol yeah lightbox would have been really hard to convert over to use a frame instead of picture
[04/09/2006 10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: lol, bummer
[04/09/2006 10:42 PM] Me: i don't know how to do it and didn't feel like figuring it out
[04/09/2006 10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: remember when I told you i was red flagged for that paypal spoof e-mail that i forwarded to paypal to report that someone sent me the spoof email?
[04/09/2006 10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: the person i talked to, before he knew the entire story, said he doesn't have too much respect for paypal, because he had someone hijacked his account before, most likely from the same e-mail that i was reporting
[04/09/2006 10:43 PM] Me: anywho since i set up the multi user i don't know how to share my local files

[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: no, the guy that I had to talk to about my incident
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: the incident was me sending a spoof e-mail to paypal (i was reporting the one someone sent me)
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: he said his paypal account was hijacked
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Me: oh,
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: most likely from the same type of email i was reporting topaypal
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Me: yeah
[04/09/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: for the shared files, just set it to display normally if the login = true
[04/09/2006 10:46 PM] Me: yeah
[04/09/2006 10:46 PM] Robert Douglas: the only thing you should change on that music page, is if it should display or not

[04/12/2006 01:12 AM] Robert Douglas: Mine looks like this, but I think it is the reason why it isn't fully working:
   public int IntVector( int first_index, int last_exclusive )
   {
          int[] temp;
          for( int i=first_index; i>last_exclusive; i++ )
          {
                  temp[i] = nums[i];
          }
          return temp; 
   }
[04/12/2006 01:32 AM] Me: make the size of your int array last_exclusive - first_index 
[04/12/2006 01:33 AM] Me: and the temp is going to be a different index
[04/12/2006 01:33 AM] Robert Douglas: mhmmm
[04/12/2006 01:33 AM] Me: make a tempIndex = 0; then within the loop put tempIndex++;
[04/12/2006 01:33 AM] Me: because the temp starts at 0 not start_index
[04/12/2006 01:35 AM] Robert Douglas:         int[last_exclusive - first_index] temp;
          for( int tempIndex = 0; tempIndex > last_exclusive; tempIndex++;
          {
                  temp[i] = nums[i];
          }
          return temp;

[04/12/2006 07:11 PM] Robert Douglas: have about 2 minutes? it's pretty sweet
[04/12/2006 07:11 PM] Me: ok
[04/12/2006 07:15 PM] Robert Douglas: go to C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc
[04/12/2006 07:16 PM] Me: ok?
[04/12/2006 07:16 PM] Robert Douglas: do you see the file named hosts?
[04/12/2006 07:17 PM] Me: yes
[04/12/2006 07:17 PM] Robert Douglas: rename it to hosts_bk
[04/12/2006 07:18 PM] *** Robert Douglas is trying to send you "hosts".
[04/12/2006 07:19 PM] Robert Douglas: then put this hosts file in that folder C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc
[04/12/2006 07:19 PM] *** You have received C:\Program Files\Trillian\users\default\downloads\AIM\BrianJCullinan\hosts.
[04/12/2006 07:21 PM] Me: ok
[04/12/2006 07:22 PM] Robert Douglas: click (Link: http://www.google.com)www.google.com
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Me: that's sweet
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Me: too bad spysweeper caught it
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Robert Douglas: now, think what kind of shit you can do
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Robert Douglas: oh really?
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Robert Douglas: you could load up a changed hosts file onto a friend comp, (have him run an .exe or something of that sort(
[04/12/2006 07:23 PM] Robert Douglas: and change the MSN news page to say "China blown up by USA Nuke"
[04/12/2006 07:24 PM] Me: lol
[04/12/2006 07:24 PM] Me: yes
[04/12/2006 07:24 PM] Robert Douglas: what did spysweeper have to say?
[04/12/2006 07:25 PM] Me: it told me they changed and said internet lookup reported a different IP
[04/12/2006 07:25 PM] Me: and changed it back
[04/12/2006 07:25 PM] Robert Douglas: ah shitty
[04/12/2006 07:26 PM] Robert Douglas: if you view the hosts file in notepad you can remove the last two lines and google will be back to normal, unnless spysweeper already did that
[04/12/2006 07:26 PM] Me: i am working on my session id
[04/12/2006 07:26 PM] Me: yeah it did
[04/12/2006 07:27 PM] Robert Douglas: i never got much into session IDs
[04/12/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: did that php uploadlink i sent over last night help?
[04/12/2006 07:28 PM] Me: i like session ids
[04/12/2006 07:28 PM] Me: i know PHP upload
[04/12/2006 07:29 PM] Robert Douglas: alright
[04/12/2006 07:29 PM] Me: i will put that in the botnik project
[04/12/2006 07:29 PM] Me: and for mine i am going to add a status bar while uploading
[04/12/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: i ran across a php uploadscript with a built in status bar yesterday too
[04/12/2006 07:30 PM] Robert Douglas: the status bar part is alot ofwork
[04/12/2006 07:30 PM] Me: yeah so i have read
[04/12/2006 07:32 PM] Me: i like ssid because it gives you more options like opening multiple windows of the same session with only a link
[04/12/2006 07:32 PM] Me: just incase cookies are turned off or not compatable
[04/12/2006 07:32 PM] Me: and if the php $_session doesn't exist
[04/12/2006 07:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yup, just about any decent php application runs with session IDs
[04/12/2006 07:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never workedwith them much, other than removing them from the actualy url
[04/12/2006 07:35 PM] Me: yeah i just spent a little but of time adding ssid to my url
[04/12/2006 07:35 PM] Me: so its static across all urls
[04/12/2006 07:35 PM] Robert Douglas: that's what my helpdesk does, atleast it is something you can always turn off using .htaccess
[04/12/2006 07:35 PM] Me: you can turn off ssid?
[04/12/2006 07:35 PM] Me: or $_SESSION?
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: i can turn off the display of the SSID in the URL
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Me: really?
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Me: why would you want to/
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Me: ?
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: looks really ugly
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Me: yeah i guess
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: change (Link: https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/helpdesk/admin/display.php?ticket=5661&sid=f4bf0343888f669d770d667d1c0dd8ff)https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/helpdesk/admin/display.php?ticket=5661&sid=f4bf0343888f669d770d667d1c0dd8ff to (Link: https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/helpdesk/admin/display.php?ticket=5661)https://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/helpdesk/admin/display.php?ticket=5661
[04/12/2006 07:36 PM] Robert Douglas: it just makes URLs look better
[04/12/2006 07:37 PM] Robert Douglas: although it wouldn't be a problem for this project,but sometimes a search engine will actually spider the page with the SSID in the URL
[04/12/2006 07:37 PM] Me: spider?
[04/12/2006 07:37 PM] Me: yeah i guess i should just use $_SESSION from now on
[04/12/2006 07:38 PM] Robert Douglas: spider, aka search engine robot (the thing that visits a page on your site and then grabs the information to index it into their dataase)
[04/12/2006 07:39 PM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt disable SIDs, it just hides it, meaning itdoesn't get displayed, but still is used
[04/12/2006 07:39 PM] Me: how do you do that with htaccess?
[04/12/2006 07:39 PM] Robert Douglas: there must be a reason why people continue to use it, but likeisaid, i havent done much with them so I dont know the reasons why they would be better than other ones
[04/12/2006 07:41 PM] Robert Douglas: add this to your .htaccess > php_flag session.use_trans_sid off
[04/12/2006 07:43 PM] Me: wow
[04/12/2006 07:44 PM] Me: that looks powerful
[04/12/2006 07:44 PM] Me: what mod does it require?
[04/12/2006 07:44 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[04/12/2006 07:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i would think mod rewrite
[04/12/2006 07:45 PM] Robert Douglas: but not sure
[04/12/2006 07:46 PM] Robert Douglas: if you dont have mod rewrite, you should really grab it, awesome stuff
[04/12/2006 07:47 PM] Me: yeah i have it
[04/12/2006 07:47 PM] Me: i was playing around with the conditionals the other night
[04/12/2006 07:48 PM] Me: hey could you use that line 
 php_flag session.use_trans_sid off for anything
[04/12/2006 07:48 PM] Me: like php_flag folder.use_trans_sid off
[04/12/2006 07:48 PM] Me: for the foldervar?
[04/12/2006 07:48 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[04/12/2006 07:48 PM] Robert Douglas: pretty sure you cannot
[04/12/2006 07:49 PM] Me: why not?
[04/12/2006 07:49 PM] Me: why does session work?
[04/12/2006 07:49 PM] Robert Douglas: because when you google  php_flag folder.use_trans_sid it doesnt come up with anyone using it, thus it doesn't exist lol
[04/12/2006 07:51 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://us2.php.net/session)http://us2.php.net/session
[04/12/2006 07:52 PM] Robert Douglas: "No external libraries are needed to build this extension." I guess you don't need another mod...
[04/12/2006 07:54 PM] Me: cool i should just put all my http_vars into $_session
[04/12/2006 07:57 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[04/12/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: my .htaccess file is pretty cool
[04/12/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: ErrorDocument 403 /scripts/error-pages/403.php
  ErrorDocument 401 /scripts/error-pages/401.php
  ErrorDocument 500 /scripts/error-pages/500.php
  ErrorDocument 400 /scripts/error-pages/400.php
  ErrorDocument 404 /scripts/error-pages/404.php
[04/12/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: I set my custom error pages
[04/12/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: RewriteEngine on
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^mrbobswebdesign\.com [NC]

[04/12/2006 07:58 PM] Me: whats that one do?
[04/12/2006 07:59 PM] Robert Douglas: whenever someone types in my domain with a www in the front, it will redirect them to the version with the ww and set the request as "301 permanetly moved"
[04/12/2006 07:59 PM] Robert Douglas: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/helpdesk [NC]

[04/12/2006 08:00 PM] Me: wow i have used custom error i didn't realize you could put it in an htaccess
[04/12/2006 08:00 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, isn't that hot?
[04/12/2006 08:01 PM] Robert Douglas: and my custom error page is awesome

[04/12/2006 08:01 PM] Me: noice
[04/12/2006 08:02 PM] Robert Douglas: it will send someone an e-mail, and let them know about the 404 error
[04/12/2006 08:02 PM] Robert Douglas: this one uses a cookie now, so it sends one report per URL
[04/12/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: but before that, my friend decided it would be funny to write a script that goes to the same url on my server, and thus generating a ton of emails
[04/12/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: he didit like 500 times
[04/12/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: this was before i put the cookie code in it
[04/12/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: so i changed the email it gets sent to,to his email, then he did it again like 5,000 times,didn't see what happened until i told him to check his email
[04/12/2006 08:04 PM] Me: lol
[04/12/2006 08:04 PM] Robert Douglas: ever heard of tormentium?
[04/12/2006 08:07 PM] Me: my errordocument handling isn't work

[04/12/2006 08:07 PM] Robert Douglas: what's in your .htaccess?
[04/12/2006 08:07 PM] Robert Douglas: just that?
[04/12/2006 08:07 PM] Me: ErrorDocument 404 /not_found.php
[04/12/2006 08:08 PM] Robert Douglas: possibly because (Link: http://bjcullinan.mine.nu/not_found.php)http://bjcullinan.mine.nu/not_found.php
[04/12/2006 08:08 PM] Robert Douglas: does not existlol
[04/12/2006 08:08 PM] Me: yes it does
[04/12/2006 08:08 PM] Robert Douglas: put a # in front of the line in ur .htaccess
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Me: ok not try it
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Me: wow that's weird
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Me: its taking a long time
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, just refresh it
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it works now
[04/12/2006 08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: not the 404, but the website
[04/12/2006 08:10 PM] Me: yeah i know
[04/12/2006 08:10 PM] Me: so whats wrong with my htaccess?
[04/12/2006 08:10 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm, good question
[04/12/2006 08:10 PM] Me: do i need to add something to the virtual host?
[04/12/2006 08:11 PM] Robert Douglas: not sure
[04/12/2006 08:11 PM] Robert Douglas: do you know how to do a log file in .htaccess?
[04/12/2006 08:11 PM] Me: no
[04/12/2006 08:11 PM] Me: kind
[04/12/2006 08:11 PM] Me: maybe not sure
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Me: am i supposed to put that htaccess file inside the folder i want to apply it to?
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be in public_html
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: or the /home
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: root/username/home/.htaccess
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: with a period
[04/12/2006 08:12 PM] Robert Douglas: in the front
[04/12/2006 08:13 PM] Me: how do you start a file with a period on windows?
[04/12/2006 08:13 PM] Robert Douglas: you cant
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Me: so?
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Robert Douglas: sec, ill send you one
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Me: no its ok
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Me: i already changed it to ht.htaccess
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Me: and it works in other places
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Me: just not with ErrorDocument 404 /not_found.php
 
[04/12/2006 08:14 PM] Robert Douglas: ht.htaccess isnt correct
[04/12/2006 08:15 PM] Robert Douglas: must be .htaccess ....
[04/12/2006 08:15 PM] Me: why?
[04/12/2006 08:15 PM] Me: i just changed it in my conf file
[04/12/2006 08:15 PM] Me: it works alright in other places
[04/12/2006 08:15 PM] Robert Douglas: might be better to just leave it as .htaccess
[04/12/2006 08:16 PM] Me: (Link: http://bjcmedia.mine.nu/users/admin/music/private/)http://bjcmedia.mine.nu/users/admin/music/private/(Link: http://bjcmedia.mine.nu/users/admin/music/private/)
[04/12/2006 08:16 PM] Me: see it works with other stuff
[04/12/2006 08:16 PM] Me: the file name is fine
[04/12/2006 08:17 PM] Me: it works it i put the ErroDocument in the virtual host
[04/12/2006 08:17 PM] Me: but not in an htaccess file
[04/12/2006 08:17 PM] Robert Douglas: you are probably right, but it might be better to just leave it as is to make sure that isnt the problem
[04/12/2006 08:18 PM] *** Robert Douglas is trying to send you ".htaccess".

[04/12/2006 08:19 PM] Robert Douglas: ah i got the error

[04/12/2006 08:22 PM] Me: now it works
[04/12/2006 08:23 PM] Robert Douglas: sexy
[04/12/2006 08:23 PM] Me: quite
[04/12/2006 08:23 PM] Me: pretty stupid mistake
[04/12/2006 08:23 PM] Robert Douglas: implement this: (Link: http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/custom-error-page-generator/)http://www.mrbobswebdesign.com/resources/custom-error-page-generator/ then you will know when someone tries to scan your website
[04/12/2006 08:24 PM] Robert Douglas: such as if they try to access /admin butit doesnt exist
[04/12/2006 08:24 PM] Robert Douglas: you know they are snooping around
[04/12/2006 08:25 PM] Me: how does it work?
[04/12/2006 08:25 PM] Me: i already have a logger
[04/12/2006 08:25 PM] Robert Douglas: it sends out an email
[04/12/2006 08:26 PM] Robert Douglas: my log files arent too easy to read
[04/12/2006 08:26 PM] Me: and i have an e-mailer

  Your hard-working web server.
[04/12/2006 08:26 PM] Me: my error logger is slightly more complex
[04/12/2006 08:26 PM] Robert Douglas: what else do you log?
[04/12/2006 08:27 PM] Me: the time and IP
[04/12/2006 08:27 PM] Me: and request_uri
[04/12/2006 08:27 PM] Me: but it rewrites a PHP page so i can build another class to print it out
[04/12/2006 08:28 PM] Robert Douglas: ah you mean it is just setup more complex
[04/12/2006 08:29 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, cant blieve it is already 830, i still ahve so much work to finish up tonight

[04/12/2006 08:30 PM] Me: but you get the idea
[04/12/2006 08:30 PM] Robert Douglas: ah thats pretty cool
[04/12/2006 08:30 PM] Robert Douglas: does it work from a DB?
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Me: no just loads txt files for each page
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Robert Douglas: ah, youare running 5.1.2
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Robert Douglas: php 5.1.2
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Me: yes
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Me: y?
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Robert Douglas: most servers arent setup for php5 yet
[04/12/2006 08:31 PM] Robert Douglas: such as mine that still is on php4
[04/12/2006 08:32 PM] Me: really how come?
[04/12/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: because most scripts around haven't been converted over to php5
[04/12/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i think php5 just recently got considered stable
[04/12/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i take it you are coding everything for php5?
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Me: yes
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Me: well dreamweaver php
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Me: so its 4 i think
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Robert Douglas: damn, i thought i asked you if you were running latest ofv4
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Me: my server is 5
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Robert Douglas: but most php4 scripts wont run on 5, and most5 wont run on 4
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Me: really?
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Robert Douglas: apparently there are a TON of very minor changes
[04/12/2006 08:33 PM] Robert Douglas: yup

[04/13/2006 08:42 PM] Me: oh yeah
[04/13/2006 08:42 PM] Me: anywho is print out the directory with ../
[04/13/2006 08:42 PM] Robert Douglas: you already fixed it or what?
[04/13/2006 08:42 PM] Me: so i could access my root dir or any part of my computer
[04/13/2006 08:42 PM] Me: using ../
[04/13/2006 08:43 PM] Robert Douglas: LOL

[04/13/2006 08:43 PM] Robert Douglas: back
[04/13/2006 08:43 PM] Me: but i have a quick fix for it
[04/13/2006 08:43 PM] Robert Douglas: force the dir to equal the root location of your music
[04/13/2006 08:44 PM] Me: yeah or just replace all the ../ with nothing
[04/13/2006 08:44 PM] Robert Douglas: thenhandle the folder requests as astring, and haveit build the string from the root location of music, plus the additional levelsof folders
[04/13/2006 08:44 PM] Me: yeah well that's what it does
[04/13/2006 08:44 PM] Robert Douglas: that still leaves a potential hole open
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Me: what hole?
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Robert Douglas: your script allows access to any folder on your website
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Robert Douglas: on your computer*
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Robert Douglas: right?
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Me: yes but if i replace all ../ with nothing that will solve the error
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Me: that is correct
[04/13/2006 08:45 PM] Robert Douglas: or are you saying you set the default to be your music folder,and that your script just allows people touse ../ to access  sub folder?
[04/13/2006 08:46 PM] Robert Douglas: i think my space bar is fucked up, eh
[04/13/2006 08:46 PM] Me: so they will never be able to get to any folder higher then the root
[04/13/2006 08:46 PM] Robert Douglas: let me know when you implement that
[04/13/2006 08:47 PM] Me: i just did
[04/13/2006 08:47 PM] Me: it replaces both ../ and ..\

[04/18/2006 04:17 PM] Me: i dread installing it on apache, recompiling should be easy
[04/18/2006 04:18 PM] Robert Douglas: one problem i see with the script is that the admin link appears on the client side of the page
[04/18/2006 04:18 PM] Robert Douglas: the admin was supposed to be a sep page
[04/18/2006 04:18 PM] Me: ok that's an easy comment out
[04/18/2006 04:19 PM] Robert Douglas: /Admin/index.php should contain the login

[04/18/2006 04:19 PM] Robert Douglas: the other files will be stored below /Admin

[04/18/2006 04:19 PM] Me: yeah
[04/18/2006 04:20 PM] Robert Douglas: if it is a biatch to set it up like that (directory-wise), then just have the admin page be admin.php
[04/18/2006 04:20 PM] Me: well all the print out functions and admin form functions are on the same page
[04/18/2006 04:20 PM] Me: so you could just have two copies
[04/18/2006 04:20 PM] Me: i mean if you want i can split them up
[04/18/2006 04:20 PM] Robert Douglas: the problem is that the link for the admin displays for the clients, and that shouldn't happen

[04/18/2006 04:21 PM] Robert Douglas: we talked about having an admin page over AIM
[04/18/2006 04:21 PM] Robert Douglas: and i was pretty sure that was included in the project details
[04/18/2006 04:22 PM] Me: yeah each one does have an admin page
[04/18/2006 04:22 PM] Robert Douglas: then remove the link on the non-admin page

[04/18/2006 07:06 PM] Me: how come you sent the files back to me?
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Me: i fixed the Admin thing
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: because i keep having to make changes to the script that you told me to do over AIM
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Me: i made those changes also
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: the comments/DB name
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Me: yeah
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: the one you sent me still used the testdb, instead of the SQL_databasename
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Me: is that it?
[04/18/2006 07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: should be it

[04/19/2006 07:47 PM] Me: now sure how we did it
[04/19/2006 07:47 PM] Me: you need 2 computers to get around it on one
[04/19/2006 07:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i know that part,but cant get around CAA via a single computer going through a router that clonses the NIC of the computer that is going throough the router
[04/19/2006 07:48 PM] Robert Douglas: jeremy has his setup and it seems to be working for him 
[04/19/2006 07:48 PM] Robert Douglas: he is using the same router,just an older firmware version

[04/19/2006 07:53 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll put the shit on a USB drive

[04/19/2006 07:54 PM] Me: yeah?
[04/19/2006 07:54 PM] Me: whats wrong with it?

[04/19/2006 07:55 PM] Me: that's cheating
[04/19/2006 07:56 PM] Robert Douglas: it's part of debugging
[04/19/2006 07:56 PM] Robert Douglas: but hasnt helped at all
[04/19/2006 07:57 PM] Me: damnit
[04/19/2006 07:57 PM] Me: i don't like sql
[04/19/2006 07:57 PM] Robert Douglas: my thoughts for the easiest way, since we aren't talking about thousands of pieces of data
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Me: yeah? load it to an array, shift them around and put them back
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: have another variable alone with each entry
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: then SORT it, from lowest to greatest
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: and display it in that sorted fashion
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: alone = along *
[04/19/2006 07:58 PM] Robert Douglas: store that variable inside the database
[04/19/2006 07:59 PM] Robert Douglas: know what i mean?
[04/19/2006 07:59 PM] Me: yeah
[04/19/2006 07:59 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be a pretty simple solution
[04/19/2006 07:59 PM] Me: but the delete offsets those values
[04/19/2006 07:59 PM] Me: so now when you have items 1, 2, 3 and you delete 2 then how do you compare 1 to 3 and switch them?
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Me: the auto increment should adjust automatically for deleted values
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Robert Douglas: when you deleted item 2, the delete command looks for the others, and renumbers them
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Me: that's what annoys me
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Me: yeah that's what i was thinking
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Robert Douglas: so, find the highest value inside the table
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Me: yeah
[04/19/2006 08:00 PM] Robert Douglas: then an if statement that loops until the highest value
[04/19/2006 08:01 PM] Me: yeah
[04/19/2006 08:01 PM] Robert Douglas: and in that process,updates each one
[04/19/2006 08:02 PM] Robert Douglas: this program doesn't need to be highly efficient
[04/19/2006 08:02 PM] Me: i just wish that using a select where id='1' +1 instead of returning the id of 2 it returns the next item
[04/19/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: what about using a foreach that will loop through each one, and return the value of the position
[04/19/2006 08:03 PM] Robert Douglas: actually, thats only with arrays i think
[04/19/2006 08:04 PM] Me: yeah
[04/19/2006 08:04 PM] Me: but mysql_fetch_row returns and array there is a way to get an array out of the values
[04/19/2006 08:05 PM] Me: instead of sorting numbers i would feel safer switching the values
[04/19/2006 08:05 PM] Robert Douglas: you would apply both
[04/19/2006 08:05 PM] Robert Douglas: it's kind of hard to explain over AIM
[04/19/2006 08:06 PM] Me: i will take care of it
[04/19/2006 08:06 PM] Robert Douglas: but what I said a couple mins ago should work, and be fairly simple to implement
[04/19/2006 08:06 PM] Me: yeah
[04/19/2006 08:07 PM] Robert Douglas: dont stress over getting that project done tonight, i wont be able to do anything with it until tomorrow around 12:30
[04/19/2006 08:08 PM] Me: that's ok i have homework to do afterwards until tomorrow night
[04/19/2006 08:08 PM] Me: so i might as well do it now
[04/19/2006 08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: alright
[04/19/2006 08:09 PM] Robert Douglas: if you want to do that blackjack one, let me know about what time
[04/19/2006 08:10 PM] Me: yeah i can come over and take a look at it with you
[04/19/2006 08:10 PM] Me: did you need help with yours?
[04/19/2006 08:10 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, I have no clue what the next step is
[04/19/2006 08:10 PM] Me: ok
[04/19/2006 08:10 PM] Robert Douglas: but whatever it is, it is something pretty minor
[04/19/2006 08:11 PM] Robert Douglas: if you can help out, you can just take my code,assuming you change a lot of the shit around so it doesnt look like a direct copy
[04/19/2006 08:11 PM] Me: ok
[04/19/2006 08:37 PM] Robert Douglas: when are u going to come over
[04/19/2006 08:38 PM] Me: uhhh half an hour
[04/19/2006 08:38 PM] Robert Douglas: alright, just send me an AIM, i'm going on away status to get some work don
[04/19/2006 08:38 PM] Robert Douglas: e

[04/20/2006 08:19 PM] Robert Douglas: the $id is the display number, right?
[04/20/2006 08:19 PM] Me: i think so
[04/20/2006 08:19 PM] Robert Douglas: the order of display
[04/20/2006 08:19 PM] Me: yeah pretty sure because it arranges by the primary key
[04/20/2006 08:20 PM] Robert Douglas: the move up/down should only display if the $id > 1
[04/20/2006 08:20 PM] Robert Douglas:  1) { echo(''); } ?>

[04/20/2006 08:22 PM] Robert Douglas: $numrow ?
[04/20/2006 08:23 PM] Robert Douglas: or $rowcount

[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: i've made some mods to the code already
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Me: like what?
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: but they will only take about 5 mins to redo
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: wrapped it aroun a template
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Me: mine might just be easier to add to it
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[04/20/2006 08:32 PM] Robert Douglas: send a .txt over aim

[04/20/2006 08:34 PM] Robert Douglas: let me see
[04/20/2006 08:35 PM] Robert Douglas: ah yeah, i fixed that
[04/20/2006 08:35 PM] Me: but i wouldn't have had that fix
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: function html_form_item($id, $short_desc, $description, $type, $printup = true, $printdown = true)
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: and then just added the if statement?
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: is that about it?
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Me: yes
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Me: that's all
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: k
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Me: and adding those 2 keys to all of them will work
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: it is going to always display it tho
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Robert Douglas: since you are sending the var = true every time
[04/20/2006 08:36 PM] Me: but the other functions have a different number of values
[04/20/2006 08:37 PM] Me: yeah except when the if is hit
[04/20/2006 08:37 PM] Me: then it won't display
[04/20/2006 08:37 PM] Me: it was just easier to disprove the condition
[04/20/2006 08:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it always displays
[04/20/2006 08:38 PM] Robert Douglas: just tested it
[04/20/2006 08:38 PM] Me: you could switch it around to be false then if( $i > 1 && $i < count -1 ) but then you still need 2 different if statements
[04/20/2006 08:38 PM] Robert Douglas: it isnt ever going to disprove
[04/20/2006 08:38 PM] Me: on the ends?

[04/20/2006 08:39 PM] Me: its trying to set the cookie after it already prints out half the page
[04/20/2006 08:40 PM] Me: copy the set cookie into a function in your header file for the page and call it when the user logs in
[04/20/2006 08:40 PM] Me: that might be why it isn't work
[04/20/2006 08:40 PM] Me: ing
[04/20/2006 08:40 PM] Me: did you add the if statements?
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: yes
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, you pass a variable that is always set to true
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: then if it is true do something
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: but it is ALWAYS going to be true
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Me: oh
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Me: in the form
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: function html_form_item($id, $short_desc, $description, $type, $printup = true, $printdown = true)

[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: it is never changed from true to false
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Me: the if statements change it
[04/20/2006 08:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i think u misunderstood it
[04/20/2006 08:42 PM] Me: but this also goes where the form is
[04/20/2006 08:42 PM] Me: <? if( $printup == true ) { ?><input type="submit" name="up" value="Up /\"><? } if( $printdown == true ) { ?><input type="submit" name="down" value="Down \/"><? } ?>
[04/20/2006 08:42 PM] Robert Douglas: if there is ONLY a single entry, there should not be an up/down button
[04/20/2006 08:42 PM] Robert Douglas: since there is no way to move it up/down

[04/20/2006 08:44 PM] Robert Douglas: you've changed more than just those two lines
[04/20/2006 08:44 PM] Me: i just told you
[04/20/2006 08:44 PM] Me: <? if( $printup == true ) { ?><input type="submit" name="up" value="Up /\"><? } if( $printdown == true ) { ?><input type="submit" name="down" value="Down \/"><? } ?>
[04/20/2006 08:44 PM] Robert Douglas: right, i changed that
[04/20/2006 08:44 PM] Me: this replaces the up and down buttons in the functions
[04/20/2006 08:45 PM] Me: oh
[04/20/2006 08:45 PM] Me: wrong if statements

[04/20/2006 08:49 PM] Me: and a function for the set cookie has to be included in your header file
[04/20/2006 08:49 PM] Me: otherwise it will keep displaying an error and never set the cookie so you will have to log in every time
[04/20/2006 08:49 PM] Me: and that changes the mode so you can never change the actual items
[04/20/2006 08:51 PM] Robert Douglas: it doesnt require me to login each time though
[04/20/2006 08:51 PM] Robert Douglas: it should be able to be included after html with no probs

[04/20/2006 10:54 PM] Robert Douglas: why would echo $lng_short_desc; not display anything? if it is  defined connect_vars.php?

[04/20/2006 11:02 PM] Robert Douglas: what's the easiest way to use a language file? i need to put global $loginfrom,$lng_name,$lng_upload_pic,$lng_position,$lng_desc,$lng_short_desc; inside of each function that calls those vars, right?

[04/21/2006 01:54 PM] Me: i'll probably get an 8 because i didn't do the extra credit

[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: yeah you have to make a function in your header file
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] *** Auto-response from Robert Douglas: I am away from my computer right now.
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: that just sets the cookie
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: and move it from login php
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: actually
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: check to see if the admin is logged in in your header
[04/21/2006 02:37 PM] Me: give me a sec
[04/21/2006 02:39 PM] Me: hmmm see its trying to set the cookie after you have already created the navigation and title for your page
[04/21/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[04/21/2006 02:44 PM] Me: hey will you send me the files when you are finished implementing them
[04/21/2006 02:44 PM] Me: i know i didn't do to well with this first job, but i need and example so i can do it better next time
[04/21/2006 02:44 PM] Robert Douglas: well the main issue that is going to cause problems later is the way you have the login setup
[04/21/2006 02:45 PM] Robert Douglas: usually you have a single page to login,then you can access the sub pages after you login at the initial page
[04/21/2006 02:45 PM] Robert Douglas: that's probably why there is this header issue too
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Robert Douglas: and the header issue happens whenever i put html above the output
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Robert Douglas: so that will need to get fixed
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Me: ok
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Robert Douglas: even without the included header, it still gives me an error with the header information
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Robert Douglas: want me to send u the shit i have right now?
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Me: put this in your header hasvalidaccess()
[04/21/2006 02:46 PM] Me: i added 
                          if( !headers_sent() ) 
                               setcookie("botnic", md5($_post['username'] . $_post['password']), time()+36000); 
 
[04/21/2006 02:47 PM] Me: so it will set the cookie in your header if there is a login, but it can still check for it in my admin pages
[04/21/2006 02:47 PM] Me: should work ok
[04/21/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: the header works from a template file
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: for the entire site
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Me: but you have a header.php
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: so should i put it  before,or after the header include?
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Me: before
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Me: before everything
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: before the login include file?
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Me: just put hasvalidaccess();
[04/21/2006 02:48 PM] Me: no
[04/21/2006 02:49 PM] Me: on the admin pages only
[04/21/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: 
  
[04/21/2006 02:49 PM] Me: sorry if i am being confusing
[04/21/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: <? include("connect_vars.php");
  include("mysql.php");
  include("login.php");
  
  hasvalidaccess(); ?>
[04/21/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: it is after the login include, and before the header include
[04/21/2006 02:50 PM] Me: <? hasvalidaccess(); php $page_title="Botnick Chevrolet - An American Revolution"; include("/home/rps/public_html/botnick/_includes/header.php"); ?> 
 
[04/21/2006 02:50 PM] Me: on the admin pages
[04/21/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, that's the same thing
[04/21/2006 02:50 PM] Me: k
[04/21/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/coupons.php?action=login)http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/coupons.php?action=login
[04/21/2006 02:51 PM] Me: then on the login.php page change line 49 to                          if( !headers_sent() ) 
                               setcookie("botnic", md5($_post['username'] . $_post['password']), time()+36000); 
 
[04/21/2006 02:51 PM] Me: darnit i thought it might do that
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: want me to send u the files?
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: yes
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: i should just create a login page
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: that was a dumb idea
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: login page
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: i can do it today
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: and then check to see if there is a cookie for each admin page
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: and send it back to you by tonight
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: on each admin page*
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: well, that would be ideal
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: yeah i have it check the cookie and print it out
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: but it isnt necessary
[04/21/2006 02:52 PM] Me: so i just have to divide it up
[04/21/2006 02:53 PM] Me: nah its ok i just want to get this project finished to i can learn from it and look forward to doing the next one better
[04/21/2006 02:54 PM] Robert Douglas: let me skin it some more and then ill send it over
[04/21/2006 02:55 PM] Me: ok
[04/21/2006 02:55 PM] Robert Douglas: i was thinking about doing a little JS that will auto update from the input box, so when you are adding a new entry you can preview it in realtime
[04/21/2006 02:55 PM] Robert Douglas: but then i ran into the problem with the fact u cant preview an image
[04/21/2006 02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: so i decided to ditch that idea
[04/21/2006 02:56 PM] Me: just put a placeholder
[04/21/2006 02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: right, but it needs to auto update
[04/21/2006 02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: only way i got close was for something in IE
[04/21/2006 02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: it wouldnt auto update at all in FF
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i just set a short interval for it to check for a new char
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Me: document.write?
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Robert Douglas: but with IE you can do the onkeypress
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Robert Douglas: no, you get to use the get element byid
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Robert Douglas: you have to use *
[04/21/2006 02:57 PM] Me: yeah
[04/21/2006 03:06 PM] Robert Douglas: btw
[04/21/2006 03:06 PM] Robert Douglas: for your music stuff
[04/21/2006 03:06 PM] Robert Douglas: how come nau doesnt stop you from running your own web server?
[04/21/2006 03:07 PM] Me: because i'm friends with my managers and they use it to

[04/21/2006 03:08 PM] Robert Douglas: nah, no webserver
[04/21/2006 03:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i have a dual opt 246 with 5 10krpm raptors in a raid 10
[04/21/2006 03:08 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd rather use that server
[04/21/2006 03:09 PM] Me: yeah
[04/21/2006 03:09 PM] Me: put your music and movies out there
[04/21/2006 03:09 PM] Robert Douglas: plus, if u dont do it right, u leave holes
[04/21/2006 03:09 PM] Robert Douglas: and holes in my system can result in major fuckage
[04/21/2006 03:09 PM] Robert Douglas: it cant hold my music
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i have too much
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Me: how do you mean?
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i have almost400gb of music
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Me: is your music and movies local or on your remote server?
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i wouldnt want to put that crap on my server
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Robert Douglas: all local
[04/21/2006 03:10 PM] Me: why not put it on your remote?
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Robert Douglas: it takes up too much space
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: oh
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: why not install apache local?
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i pay premium for bandwidth
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: not from NAU
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Robert Douglas: well NAU will monitor bw
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: put apache on your local comp
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i thought about it
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: and do what i do
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: and share
[04/21/2006 03:11 PM] Me: not share
[04/21/2006 03:12 PM] Me: make available to other temporarily
[04/21/2006 03:12 PM] Me: *others
[04/21/2006 03:12 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah i might do that later on

[04/21/2006 03:12 PM] Me: pretty simple
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Robert Douglas: once that music shit is done
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll prolly put mine up
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Me: yeah soon dude then i'm working on pictures
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Robert Douglas: yea
[04/21/2006 03:13 PM] Robert Douglas: i might have u come on board for my (Link: http://www.learnbydemo.com)www.learnbydemo.com project
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Robert Douglas: it is one of my other companies that sells flash based tutorials for a targetted audience
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Me: whats this site for?
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Me: cool
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Robert Douglas: basically, i go in and create a tutorial set, sell it to a client, and then the client uses it for his clients
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Robert Douglas: however, I brand it to either my company name, or to my client's name
[04/21/2006 03:14 PM] Robert Douglas: to avoid copying
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Me: cool cool
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Robert Douglas: ideally, i want the process to be automatica
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Me: what needs to be done on this site, looks pretty well done
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Robert Douglas: you pay, upload the picture
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Robert Douglas: using php, you modify an .fla file to replace a picture
[04/21/2006 03:15 PM] Robert Douglas: compile it, save the swf output
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Me: oh you want the branding to be done automatically?
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: and then send off an email to the client for them to preview/download the tut
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: tutorials
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be hot
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Me: that would be sweet
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: so i just make the tutorials, sit back and let people buy them
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: without having ANY intervention at all
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Robert Douglas: without advertising, i bring in like $30-$60/month
[04/21/2006 03:16 PM] Me: can flash instead just load an external file after being compiled?
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: with advertising, i could easily bring in a couple thousand
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Me: sweet
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: yes, but the problem is that what is stopping someone from just buying one set, and then changing the image file and reselling it off as mine?
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: it actually has to manually edit the fla file, and then compile it to output an swf file
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Me: yeah i see
[04/21/2006 03:17 PM] Robert Douglas: i havent found a way to do it
[04/21/2006 03:18 PM] Me: unless!
[04/21/2006 03:18 PM] Robert Douglas: lol

[04/23/2006 02:22 PM] Me: it does nothing
[04/23/2006 02:22 PM] Me: (Link: http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/login.php)http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/login.php
[04/23/2006 02:22 PM] Me: shows up ok though
[04/23/2006 02:22 PM] Me: and remove action=login from the links on the side
[04/23/2006 02:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i only added some vars to the config include
[04/23/2006 02:23 PM] Me: hmmm
[04/23/2006 02:23 PM] Robert Douglas: you can download all the files to  make sure
[04/23/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: but the only ones i have changed are the 3 admin files
[04/23/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: might be a cookie issue on your comp with the authentication
[04/23/2006 02:24 PM] Me: yeah but then it should display the forms again
[04/23/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: or better yet, try it without the page authenticating the user
[04/23/2006 02:24 PM] Me: very strange
[04/23/2006 02:25 PM] Me: yeah its not setting the cookie
[04/23/2006 02:25 PM] Me: but i can't get it to echo anything either
[04/23/2006 02:25 PM] Me: how come?
[04/23/2006 02:25 PM] Robert Douglas: let me look
[04/23/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/staff_bios.php)http://botnick.rp-s.com/Admin/staff_bios.php
[04/23/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: it displays
[04/23/2006 02:26 PM] Me: yeah
[04/23/2006 02:26 PM] Me: that's good
[04/23/2006 02:26 PM] Me: here i'll send you the files
[04/23/2006 02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: i can d/l them
[04/23/2006 02:27 PM] Me: oh ok
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: lines 34 through 41 handle the admin page
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: that's not happening at all
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: lines 4 through 13 set the cookie
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: but that isn
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: t happening either
[04/23/2006 02:28 PM] Me: the only thing in common is hasValidAccess() must not be returning properly
[04/23/2006 02:29 PM] Me: but i can't get it to echo any vars
[04/23/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: that's weird
[04/23/2006 02:33 PM] Me: yeah
[04/23/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: it isnt setting the cookie
[04/23/2006 02:36 PM] Me: i know
[04/23/2006 02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: login.php
[04/23/2006 02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: is calling for ../connect_vars.php
[04/23/2006 02:37 PM] Me: oh
[04/23/2006 02:37 PM] Me: oopsess
[04/23/2006 02:38 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[04/23/2006 02:38 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt seem to fix it tho
[04/23/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll be back in about 15

[04/23/2006 10:54 PM] Me: damnit
[04/23/2006 10:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm just looking at some homes for rent
[04/23/2006 10:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i think i might rent out a home next semester
[04/23/2006 10:55 PM] Me: ok this is bullshit, md5($username . $password) is very different from md5($_post['username'] . $_post['password']) even if they equal the same damn thing
[04/23/2006 10:55 PM] Me: !
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Me: so createCookie() uses md5($username . $password)
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that MD5 hash is a one way hash
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why it wont always be the same value
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Me: yeah but the two text values are the same
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Me: but that is only called if the user has valid access so there shouldn't be any security loop holes
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Robert Douglas: oh yea,they are just read in
[04/23/2006 10:56 PM] Me: what?
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: rather just get rid of the login and i'll .htaccess thje /Admin folder?
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: no fuck that it works now
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: should work for you
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: click on admin login
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: then login
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: when i go to coupons
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: then everything displays
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Robert Douglas: i have to still click "admin login"
[04/23/2006 10:57 PM] Me: i only have job_opps done
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: ah ok
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Me: but it will only take me 5 minutes to do the others
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: was it just a cookie problem?
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Me: yeah
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Me: kinda
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Me: a few little errors
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Me: but mainly that stupid cookie fuck problem
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: alright
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: cool
[04/23/2006 10:58 PM] Robert Douglas: job ops works
[04/23/2006 10:59 PM] Me: that doesn't make any sense though if $username == $_post["username"] then md5($username) should equal md5($_post["username"])
[04/23/2006 10:59 PM] Me: what bullshit
[04/23/2006 10:59 PM] Me: right?
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Me: must be the datatype or something
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Robert Douglas: but the post will only be for the login page
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Me: super globals might have a \0 being encoded or something
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Me: yeah
[04/23/2006 11:00 PM] Me: everything will work
[04/23/2006 11:01 PM] Me: just need to make an index.php with header("Location: login.php");

[04/23/2006 11:02 PM] Me: i'll finish it when i get home then i can git paid

[04/23/2006 11:02 PM] Me: finally

[04/25/2006 03:48 PM] Robert Douglas: i'd have you develop the site so that it runs from a DB, and all orders and whatnot can be auto processed
[04/25/2006 03:49 PM] Robert Douglas: it would need to use that technology to add an image onto a flash slide
[04/25/2006 03:49 PM] Me: oh yeah
[04/25/2006 03:49 PM] Robert Douglas: if this is something u could do, we could work out something like a large % of the company profit

[04/25/2006 04:09 PM] Me: so i got mod_deflate working
[04/25/2006 04:09 PM] *** Auto-response from Robert Douglas: I am away from my computer right now.
[04/25/2006 04:09 PM] Me: its pretty sweet
[04/25/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: you dont want that one
[04/25/2006 04:10 PM] Me: why?
[04/25/2006 04:10 PM] Me: mod_gzip is for apache 1.3
[04/25/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: i've never used that, but the zlib is the compression one
[04/25/2006 04:10 PM] Me: mod_deflate works fine
[04/25/2006 04:11 PM] Me: zlib is for php
[04/25/2006 04:11 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm
[04/25/2006 04:11 PM] Robert Douglas: looks like you are right
[04/25/2006 04:11 PM] Robert Douglas: The mod_deflate module provides the DEFLATE output filter that allows output from your server to be compressed before being sent to the client over the network.
[04/25/2006 04:11 PM] Me: sounds delicious

[04/25/2006 04:13 PM] Me: yes
[04/25/2006 04:13 PM] Me: soooo rar.exe won't compress zip formats
[04/25/2006 04:13 PM] Me: i don't know the command and i looked through all the command help file
[04/25/2006 04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: rar.exe?
[04/25/2006 04:14 PM] Robert Douglas: zip is already compressed
[04/25/2006 04:14 PM] Me: yes the command line version of winRar
[04/25/2006 04:14 PM] Me: i know i can't get rar.exe to do zips
[04/25/2006 04:14 PM] Me: whats the windows command to use the windows compression?
[04/25/2006 04:15 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno
[04/25/2006 04:16 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm, that mod_deflate looks pretty good
[04/25/2006 04:16 PM] Robert Douglas: i havent found anything bad about it yet
[04/25/2006 04:16 PM] Me: yuppers
[04/25/2006 04:16 PM] Me: mod_gunzip and mod_gzip is for old apache
[04/25/2006 04:17 PM] Me: mod_deflate is 60% more efficient
[04/25/2006 04:18 PM] Robert Douglas: defalte is pretty intense
[04/25/2006 04:18 PM] Me: yeah
[04/25/2006 04:18 PM] Robert Douglas: what code are you using?
[04/25/2006 04:18 PM] Me: wow even that tiny index page it compresses 57.8%
[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Me: what code?
[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Robert Douglas: to run the mod_deflate
[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Me: how do you mean?
[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Me: its just an apache mod
[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Robert Douglas: but it looks highly customizable

[04/25/2006 04:19 PM] Me: this being most important
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Me: Richard pointed out earlier it was trying to zip my mp3 files while he was streaming them
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Me: they came out like 3 seconds long and no sound
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Me: pretty sweet
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Robert Douglas: where did you read about it being more efficient?
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Robert Douglas: thats cool
[04/25/2006 04:20 PM] Me: just on the apache site
[04/25/2006 04:21 PM] Me: maybe not

[04/25/2006 04:22 PM] Robert Douglas: alright
[04/25/2006 04:22 PM] Robert Douglas: wont it still run the deflate tho?
[04/25/2006 04:23 PM] Me: only on html pages
[04/25/2006 04:23 PM] Robert Douglas: about 2 hrs ago
[04/25/2006 04:23 PM] Me: huh?
[04/25/2006 04:23 PM] Robert Douglas: i was downlaoding near 3mb/s
[04/25/2006 04:23 PM] Me: yeah?
[04/25/2006 04:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i have NEVER gone that fast before
[04/25/2006 04:24 PM] Me: wow that is fast
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: are u running pure-ftpd?
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Me: no i want to know about your ftp server
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Me: mine sucks
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Me: and i want a new one
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Me: which one do you use?
[04/25/2006 04:26 PM] Robert Douglas: pure ftpd is the way to go
[04/25/2006 04:27 PM] Me: i need to get that
[04/25/2006 04:27 PM] Me: but dreamweaver wouldn't connect to it
[04/25/2006 04:27 PM] Robert Douglas: DW cant connect to shit
[04/25/2006 04:28 PM] Me: wait wait
[04/25/2006 04:28 PM] Me: maaaayyyybbe
[04/25/2006 04:28 PM] Me: no
[04/25/2006 04:28 PM] Me: failed
[04/25/2006 04:29 PM] Me: hey it did work
[04/25/2006 04:29 PM] Me: wow
[04/25/2006 04:29 PM] Robert Douglas: how the fuck did it work
[04/25/2006 04:30 PM] Me: (Link: ftp://botnick.rp-s.com/)ftp://botnick.rp-s.com/ for location and brian:brian for user:pass
[04/25/2006 04:30 PM] Me: pretty noice
[04/25/2006 04:30 PM] Robert Douglas: so the hostname you used is botnick.rp-s.com ?
[04/25/2006 04:30 PM] Me: yes
[04/25/2006 04:31 PM] Me: wasn't it supposed to be rp-s.com?
[04/25/2006 04:31 PM] Robert Douglas: it works from the IP
[04/25/2006 04:31 PM] Robert Douglas: so any decent FTP client should accept botnick.rp-s.com, rp-s.com, or 72.34.41.112
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Me: oh ok
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: my ftp serveris setup with FTP over TLS
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: so it is all encrypted
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: and DW can't do that
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Me: so dreamweaver sucks less
[04/25/2006 04:32 PM] Robert Douglas: super sucky

[04/25/2006 07:07 PM] Robert Douglas: this summer i am going to organize all my music

[04/25/2006 07:08 PM] Robert Douglas: ah, i like that
[04/25/2006 07:09 PM] Robert Douglas: use image magick to crreate a thumb,then use the lightbox javascript to have the preview of a larger version
[04/25/2006 07:09 PM] Robert Douglas: that would be hot
[04/25/2006 07:09 PM] Me: hmm single click in thumbs view
[04/25/2006 07:09 PM] Me: then double click opens new window
[04/25/2006 07:10 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, single = add to selection
[04/25/2006 07:10 PM] Robert Douglas: then double = preview larger version
[04/25/2006 07:10 PM] Me: hmmm that works too

[04/25/2006 07:13 PM] Me: there are more then that
[04/25/2006 07:13 PM] Me: yes of course
[04/25/2006 07:13 PM] Robert Douglas: you'll also want to set the /users/ folder to have no indexes
[04/25/2006 07:14 PM] Robert Douglas: oooo
[04/25/2006 07:14 PM] Robert Douglas: remember that one script i was telling you about, that would hide your javascript or css code if you try to manually viewit?
[04/25/2006 07:14 PM] Robert Douglas: you could do the same for your mp3s, so nobody would ever be able to actually download the mp3s
[04/25/2006 07:22 PM] Robert Douglas: omg, this shit is hot
[04/25/2006 07:22 PM] Robert Douglas: i love this power amp program

[04/25/2006 09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: into the .htaccess for /users/
[04/25/2006 09:26 PM] Robert Douglas: it will make it so a directory structure is not displayed

[04/26/2006 03:59 PM] Me: hmmm
[04/26/2006 03:59 PM] Robert Douglas: see, when you move a domain from one IP to another, to avoid dns caching, you lower the TTL
[04/26/2006 03:59 PM] Robert Douglas: wait around 8 hours
[04/26/2006 03:59 PM] Robert Douglas: then change the domain over to the new IP
[04/26/2006 04:00 PM] Robert Douglas: if you don't ever lower the TTL, it will still have the old IP cached

[04/26/2006 05:15 PM] Me: what?
[04/26/2006 05:15 PM] Robert Douglas: if you view an image,then go view another one, it doesn't have that expand transition like it did the first time
[04/26/2006 05:15 PM] Robert Douglas: meaning, it opens to the full size automatically
[04/26/2006 05:15 PM] Me: yeah because it doesn't need to expand

[05/24/2006 05:53 PM] Me: i couldn't log on to the other ftp site
[05/24/2006 05:53 PM] Me: yeah it never let me log in
[05/24/2006 05:54 PM] Me: so we can either work on my getting the right permissions
[05/24/2006 05:54 PM] Robert Douglas: well, it needs to be in the right place
[05/24/2006 05:54 PM] Me: or you can copy it over

[05/24/2006 05:55 PM] Me: fun
[05/24/2006 05:55 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why i gave you FTP information

[05/24/2006 05:59 PM] Me: that my username would be brian@botnickchevrolet.com

[05/24/2006 06:00 PM] Robert Douglas: because the IP of the site is a shared IP, it allows for each client to use common usernames, such as security, sales, etc...

[05/24/2006 06:10 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, your dns is being cached
[05/24/2006 06:11 PM] Robert Douglas: it needs to point to the correct IP
[05/24/2006 06:11 PM] Me: well i made those changes
[05/24/2006 06:11 PM] Me: what to test it?
[05/24/2006 12:12 PM] Robert Douglas: to see the site on my server, instead of where the domain's DNS is pointing to, yes, to test it you will need to have the correct IP
[05/24/2006 12:12 PM] Robert Douglas: ipconfig/flushdns sometimes helps

[05/24/2006 07:24 PM] Me: other then you though it works quite nicely
[05/24/2006 07:24 PM] Me: deletes the old image and everything
[05/24/2006 07:24 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, well it has to work for everyone
[05/24/2006 07:24 PM] Me: yeah i know
[05/24/2006 07:25 PM] Robert Douglas: hmm, it might work now
[05/24/2006 07:25 PM] Robert Douglas: let me try something
[05/24/2006 07:26 PM] Me: oops we are both trying to change it at the same time
[05/24/2006 07:26 PM] Me: wait i just got a 0 too
[05/24/2006 07:26 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[05/24/2006 07:27 PM] Me: there it is
[05/24/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: seems to work now
[05/24/2006 07:28 PM] Robert Douglas: at least that time it did
[05/24/2006 07:29 PM] Robert Douglas: when i delete an entry i get:

[05/24/2006 07:33 PM] Me: noice
[05/24/2006 07:34 PM] Me: finally
[05/24/2006 07:34 PM] Me: we can be done with this
[05/24/2006 07:34 PM] Me: hopefully
[05/24/2006 07:34 PM] Me: should i put it in the right directories?
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Me: and overwrite the current index
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Me: ?
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Robert Douglas: you mean on the client side?
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Me: yeah
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Robert Douglas: just have the client side files in the public_html dir
[05/24/2006 07:35 PM] Robert Douglas: as long as they work, i'll work from them
[05/24/2006 07:36 PM] Me: ok
[05/24/2006 07:38 PM] Robert Douglas: can u confirm that the client side files are good?
[05/24/2006 07:39 PM] Me: how do you mean?
[05/24/2006 07:39 PM] Me: yes they are the most recent version
[05/24/2006 07:39 PM] Me: the surround GUI was never applied to the public files only to the admin pages
[05/24/2006 07:51 PM] Me: so are we done?
[05/24/2006 07:51 PM] Me: back to work on our own projects?
[05/24/2006 07:51 PM] Me: what were you doing previous to this troubleshooting?

[06/08/2006 02:22 PM] Me: if you look at his website he has more that he did and they suck too
[06/08/2006 02:23 PM] Robert Douglas: you should put the site in a centered div
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Me: you think it looks better centered?
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Me: i kinda liked it on the side
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Me: i'll try that
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: looks good on the side in 800x600
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: but anything higherr it would look better centered
[06/08/2006 02:24 PM] Robert Douglas: i just bought that lian li v2100 case w/ support for 12 hard drives
[06/08/2006 02:25 PM] Robert Douglas: upgraded my PSU to the 700watt version

[06/08/2006 02:25 PM] Me: wow that sounds hot
[06/08/2006 02:25 PM] *** Robert Douglas is now directly connected.
[06/08/2006 02:25 PM] Robert Douglas: it is gunna be super badass
[06/08/2006 02:25 PM] Me: hey are your servers virtualized?
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Me: Vmware or anything?
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: whats that
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Me: have you looked into Vmware?
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: dont think so
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Me: ok imagine this scenario this is what i want to do but you can apply it to any server
[06/08/2006 02:26 PM] Robert Douglas: 
[06/08/2006 02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: checkout that milf
[06/08/2006 02:27 PM] Me: wow who is that?
[06/08/2006 02:27 PM] Me: vmware loads up their own version of linux on the Vmware ESX server
[06/08/2006 02:27 PM] Me: off of that you can create a virtual machine
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Me: with disk storage that can be dynamically allocated while the machine is running
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Robert Douglas: so the virtual server is just easier to manage with upgrades and such then?
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Me: all the settings are through a web browser so the server can be managed externally
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Robert Douglas: that is jannet
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Robert Douglas: she came over swimming last week
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Me: jannet is hot
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Robert Douglas: but forgot the bottoms of her two piece, so swam in her panties
[06/08/2006 02:28 PM] Me: yes the real server runs virtual machines
[06/08/2006 02:29 PM] Robert Douglas: what is the OS then?
[06/08/2006 02:29 PM] Me: so on those virtual machines you can install anything you want, if you want a linux file server just install it normally
[06/08/2006 02:29 PM] Me: it boots up just like a normal computer
[06/08/2006 02:29 PM] Me: the benefit being, the master server never goes down
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Me: and when a virtual machine has problems, all you have to do is replace the disk file with a backed up version
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Me: you could even put windows 2003 server on it
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Robert Douglas: ah that is sweet
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Me: or just put windows vista betas like 6 different versions
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Robert Douglas: so it is basically a management console for all your servers?
[06/08/2006 02:30 PM] Me: when you have to restart your computer it only restarts 1 machine
[06/08/2006 02:31 PM] Me: yeah pretty much
[06/08/2006 02:31 PM] Me: but you can allocate certain real resources to each machine
[06/08/2006 02:31 PM] Me: like if you wanted a hard drive with 8 gigs for a beta vista, and 200 gigs for a linux file server you could do that
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Me: even better, you can allocate memory for each machine
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: it is a cool idea
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: but i dont think it would benefit a hosting company
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: since you want more servers
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Me: and for larger applications you can allocate certain ethernet adapters for each machine so if you are running a server that allows for multiple user access it will only use certain connections
[06/08/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: one computer can't handle the entire load
[06/08/2006 02:33 PM] Me: the benefit is you run a virtual machine and when the server crashes, if it crashes then you just restart the machine normally, and other servers don't go down
[06/08/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: I am away from my computer right now.
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Me: but i guess it really only applies if you are running a windows server
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Me: because windows crashes
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: we dont have that prob
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: we still have remote access to the servers tho
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Me: yeah that's good
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so we can restart the server without being there
[06/08/2006 02:34 PM] Me: i guess i would use it because everything can be dynamically allocated while the machine is runnings
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Me: like i could resize the windows hard drive while it was turned on
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, i try to stay far away from windows
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Me: yeah
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Me: but heres my plan
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Me: i get a server and run VM ESX on it
[06/08/2006 02:35 PM] Me: i have a linux file server for my websites and such
[06/08/2006 02:36 PM] Me: i have a windows server for ASP and remotes desktop connections
[06/08/2006 02:36 PM] Me: i have a vista beta install just to skrew around with
[06/08/2006 02:36 PM] Me: i have another linux install using KDE
[06/08/2006 02:36 PM] Me: then i get a UPS
[06/08/2006 02:36 PM] Robert Douglas: that program scares me
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: what?
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: vmware?
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: its amazing look at their site, vmware.com
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: i g2g
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: ttyl
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, souns way too powerful
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: arlgith man, take it ez
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Me: its amazing
[06/08/2006 02:37 PM] Robert Douglas: we'll talk more about this later i'm sure
