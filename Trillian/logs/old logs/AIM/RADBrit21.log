radbrit21: no, i don't even think i'm going
*** Auto-response sent to radbrit21: I am currently away from the computer.
BrianJCullinan: well you can go ahead and be now because i'm stepping down
BrianJCullinan: so you can go, and not have to listen to the music i play
BrianJCullinan: you can take your own and play it
radbrit21: lol why?
BrianJCullinan: because i knew you had a problem with it, and scott is pretty against it aswell, i don't want to start any trouble
radbrit21: no i have no problem with it
radbrit21: go ahead
BrianJCullinan: he told me not to, so i guess i'll just leave it up to everyone else to make the party suck ass, i don't want to contribute to make it fun anymore
BrianJCullinan: jeffrey doesn't want me to either
BrianJCullinan: and i'm sure if everyone knew i was going to handle the music there would be more people that didn't want me to
radbrit21: lol!
radbrit21: awwww
BrianJCullinan: but i'm fine with it, i don't really care, something would have gotten broken anyways
BrianJCullinan: i just thought it would be a good idea because i invested lots of money into my computer and i have somethings on it that might have been fun
radbrit21: what kinda stuff you got?
BrianJCullinan: well i have video output, i can put my computer screen on a TV just like at school with the projectors
BrianJCullinan: i have lots of music, and an almost flawless Media Library of all genres, and Windows Media Party Mode to go with it
radbrit21: THEN DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BrianJCullinan: I have a 10 visualization that i baught online thats incredible, and a lot better then any of the free ones, definatly with the $10
BrianJCullinan: no thanks, i would have just ended up spending the whole night on the computer, and people would have fought over when music to play, i just don't want to put up with it.  My 18" flat screen monitor, remote controled TV, and remote (cordless) optical mouse and keyboard would have also been nice to use
