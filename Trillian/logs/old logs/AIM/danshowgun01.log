[20/12/2004 04:04 AM] Daniel:  
 By accepting inclusion to Allied Realm Kingdoms Together In Council, you agree to the following terms.
 
 1. As a member of A.R.K.T.I.C. you vow to uphold Honor as a core discipline to which your guild/clan's policies will adhere and by which the members representing your guild/clan and this alliance will conduct themselves.
 
 1a. Member guilds/clans who do not maintain their integrity may be removed from the alliance. Efforts will be made by member guilds and the ruling core guilds to iron out any issues before serious issues occur. Member guilds whose members act inappropriately will be notified and will have the opportunity to handle the issues internally. If, however, a member guild of A.R.K.T.I.C. supports the continued inappropriate behavior of its members, it will be considered to have adopted likewise inappropriate policy and will be considered for removal by the Core Guilds.

Completely free and reliable! Everyone should have a server of their own!
[20/12/2004 04:05 AM] Daniel: 2. All members of A.R.K.T.I.C. must uphold a non-PK stance. We understand that there are different games with different play styles and politics, and in turn, each circumstance will be reasonable evaluated. However, A.R.K.T.I.C. does not and will not support the style of gameplay which targets innocent players for griefing or harrassment or any gameplay which is intended to ruin the gaming experience of others. The only exception to the rule is that PKK guilds who retaliate against known PKs (who adopt the above noted dishonorable play style) in an attempt to change their ways or remove them from the games so others may enjoy their gaming experience. Non-PK, Anti-PK and PKK guilds are welcome. Games of Strategy or total PVP where the point of the game is to compete against other players are exempt from the above, however, honorable tactics need to be employed and will be discussed on a case-by-case basis
[20/12/2004 04:05 AM] Daniel: 3. All member guilds/clans of A.R.K.T.I.C. acknowledge that the Core Members of The Equalizers ({=}), Guardians of Justice (GoJ) and Imperial Rulers of Destiny ([IRD]) are the governing council. Alliance decisions will be made based upon input from all members and we will attempt to develop an environment of equality and fairness... but if there is a decision that must be made in non-unanimous terms, the Core Members have final verdict. As Founding members, The Equalizers have veto power on any Alliance ruling. (Let it be known that as of yet, the Veto power has never been called for).
 
 4. There is to be no in-fighting among A.R.K.T.I.C. guilds. This includes in-game as well as outside of game. We come together as mature, intelligent, honorable equals and as such disputes must be dealt with in a peaceful manner. If member guilds are asked to leave or choose to leave, it is intended that we do so as friends who have parted ways. 
 
 5. A.R.K.T.I.C. member guilds recognize that the A.R.K.T.I.C. Alliance is owned and operated by The Equalizers Guild. In-game clan size/level/status does not play a factor. The Equalizers, Guardians of Justice, or Imperial Rulers Of Destiny will be regarded as the "head" of the alliance in any game in which they are present as is appropriate. In the event that a A.R.K.T.I.C. member guild is establishing diplomatic relations within a game that {=}, GoJ or IRD does not participate in, that guild will be considered the "head" of the alliance in that game. However, all members of A.R.K.T.I.C. must be approved by {=}Quaythescus before being listed as such.

[11/20/2005 11:36 PM] Daniel Armstrong: Carnage Blender
[11/20/2005 11:36 PM] Daniel Armstrong: click on that
[11/20/2005 11:37 PM] Me: yeah so?
[11/20/2005 11:37 PM] Me: ''Carnage Blender'' is an independent text-based MMORPG that gives players control over small teams of "minions" (troops) which duel directly against other players around the world. Experience and money allows you to train and equip your minions to varying degrees, so you can choose your strengths and weaknesses.
 
 ''Carnage Blender'' was created by Johnathan Ellis from Utah, in 2002.
 
 recently, a second, very similar incarnation, dubbed ''Carnage Blender 2'' was created, mixing up the rules and allowing new players a chance to start without interference from those who have been playing for years.
