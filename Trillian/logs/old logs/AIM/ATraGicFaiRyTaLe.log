ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: u read my mind.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: wut shall we talk about?
BrianJCullinan: anything
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: hm...
BrianJCullinan: this girl from ohio says she likes me again, but i'm afraid to trust her
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: id ont know.
BrianJCullinan: before she led me on to the extent of wanting to sleep with me
BrianJCullinan: it was really bad
BrianJCullinan: i was very upset, i am afraid to trust her and i don't know what to say to her when she tells me how much she wants to be with me
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: wait wait wut. she said she wanted to sleep with u and then wut happened?
BrianJCullinan: she lead me on
BrianJCullinan: she didn't really want
BrianJCullinan: she 'played
BrianJCullinan: ' me
BrianJCullinan: and so we stopped talking
BrianJCullinan: and now we talked again and she says she wants to be with me
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: i wouldnt know if i could trust her or not. but even if she did its too hard to have a long distance relationship
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: od
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: *oo
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: well wut do u want?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: do u feel the same about her?
BrianJCullinan: yeah i know, thats the other thing i'm concerned about, she keeps telling me how much she wishes she had a boyfriend in ohio, and i can't do anything about that
BrianJCullinan: i don't know if i could feel the same way after what she did, i want to be with Kristina
BrianJCullinan: i haven't found anyone that i feel could ever be more right for me then Kristina
BrianJCullinan: shes SMART!
BrianJCullinan: she isn't an idiot like a lot of other girls i have met
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ic. well. why cant u be with kristina?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: thats good. 
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: she will be good for u cuz ur smart too. and ya...lol
BrianJCullinan: shes not skanky, shes not dirty, shes never even been kised, just like me
BrianJCullinan: i can't be with her because....  she told me not to ask er out again until collage
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: awww thats so cute. 
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: why not? 
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: why so long away?
BrianJCullinan: only problem is i'm going to ohio for collage
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: o that sucks. but by then u will prolly find someone.
BrianJCullinan: so the only time i have left to be with her is shortening day by day and passing by while i sit here and day dream about her
BrianJCullinan: but i want to be with her, she is the first girl that i really really liked when i moved here
BrianJCullinan: since 8th grade
BrianJCullinan: i still remember everything about her
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: oic
BrianJCullinan: the way she looked, the way she acted, everything we argued about, every thing we talked about
BrianJCullinan: i remember every detail
BrianJCullinan: i remember spending time with her in washington
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: well theres not much u can do...u can try again. maybe shes changed her mind. but u will just have to find someone else. theres more people out there just like her and u can find one of them to be with.
BrianJCullinan: we did 'go out' if thats what you would call it
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: memories are the best.  i love them.  theyre something no one can touch or ruin and its something u will have forever.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: o u did? well then why did u break up if u liked her so much?
BrianJCullinan: the day after we started going out we went to an island with the rest of the people and we hung out the whole time
BrianJCullinan: i remember sitting on a dirt road with her, i suggested that we go buy ice cream, lol.  kelsey and matt and jeffery were there and we were all very board
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: thats awesome.
BrianJCullinan: i picked a flower and put it in her hair and told her i wanted a hug
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: aw thats so sweet
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: it reminds me of that brooks and dunn song red dirt road. 
BrianJCullinan: she responded shyly and told me she didn't know i liked her, she looked so beautiful, i wanted to be close to her but there was always something between us
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya. i know wut u mean. so then wut happened?
BrianJCullinan: i still feel that way, if i could go back, i would tell her what i felt, and tell her i want to be with her for a long time, i would never have even suggested that we break up
BrianJCullinan: we argued, later she admitted she was inexpierienced, but so was i, i didn't want it to happen like that, it was after the school year had ended
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: i wish u could go back
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: o
BrianJCullinan: i guess in a way it was for the better, she was taller then me at the time and i was shy to be with a girl taller then me, and then she found a new boyfriend
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: its hard to have two people who are inexperienced cuz no one konw wut to do. not that theres rules...but i dunno. i would think it would be weird.
BrianJCullinan: but i have thought about her every day since then
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: o really. im sorry.
BrianJCullinan: now i just want to see her again, be friends with her again, maybe even go out again, but i can be patient
BrianJCullinan: anyways, do you have any really sad love stories to tell?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yes patience is good.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: sad love stories? like wut?
BrianJCullinan: anything
BrianJCullinan: ?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: well i like jeremy. and he doesnt like me. thats about it.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: my battery on the computer is low so if i go its cuz it shut off
BrianJCullinan: ok
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: um. i have pathetic stories. but it was lust...i dont even think it was that. just an infatuation
BrianJCullinan: lol that was a very smart word
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: like the preston situation. and josh. i dont know.
BrianJCullinan: yeah....

BrianJCullinan: thats weird
BrianJCullinan: i would stay away

BrianJCullinan: *bangs head on table*
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: just be like "is it ok that i have ur sn. i asked jac but she said u prolly wouldnt mind."
BrianJCullinan: maybe i will just stare at her screen name when she comes online
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: thats wut i used to do.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: lol
BrianJCullinan: i will appologize for my abrupt intrusion of her privacy and go on to explain that i felt it was neccissary if i ever planned to be able to talk to her in person
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yes.
BrianJCullinan: then i will ask is it is ok, and tell her i used my available assets to obtain her screen name
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yes.
BrianJCullinan: this is excellent
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya
BrianJCullinan: now i can talk to her, and she can talk to me
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: but my sis is sooo suspicious. shes like ur not givin it to n e one right. im like...no course not...and she comes and sits right next to me which she never does and looks at my screen.
BrianJCullinan: how would you feel if somebody used their assets to get your screen name?
BrianJCullinan: wouldn't you feel a little insecure around that person?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: no. people do it to me all the time. and i def do it to other people. even to ryan raji who i liked so much and he was cool about it.
BrianJCullinan: yeah but she is, innocent, and shy, if you will
BrianJCullinan: what if shes afraid of me?
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: i dont think she is.
BrianJCullinan: well i can stand just sitting here thinking about her, i was forced to take aggressive action
BrianJCullinan: i must talk to her
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yes
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: isnt it weird when u like someone as a ffriend. and then a friend starts likeing them more than a friend. and u get jealous?
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: thats why i have to get closer to her now
BrianJCullinan: before anyone else does
BrianJCullinan: and if something goes wrong, like shes not ready
BrianJCullinan: its easier to take a step away then it is forward
BrianJCullinan: so where there is opportunity you should always take advantage of it
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yes. i agree.
BrianJCullinan: i wish she would come online
BrianJCullinan: i would be all perky if she did
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: but wut if u just like someone as a friend cuz theyre so nice and funny. and never thought of a relationship. then all of a sudden a close friend of urs says they like ur friend. and u realize u might like him too. and u get all jealous. its so crazy.
BrianJCullinan: shes so beautiful *sigh* but so young
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya.
BrianJCullinan: yeah it is
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya it is.
BrianJCullinan: and its annoying, its like why couldn't i see them this way before
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: its weird. 
BrianJCullinan: and a lot of the time you never no how much they mean to you until you can't have them anymore
BrianJCullinan: your afraid they will get closer to YOUR friend then you are
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: so true.
BrianJCullinan: i'd never miss out, if i find a sweet attractive girl, i'm going to learn i can about her
BrianJCullinan: earn her trust and be with her as much as i can
BrianJCullinan: (ex. movies, dinners, fun stuff)
BrianJCullinan: my friend stephanie, i'd probably go out with her
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: why dont u go out with her?
BrianJCullinan: we've gone to movies together, we've done other things together, we tease eachother a lot, shes pretty
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: aw.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: cute.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: but shes just a friend?
BrianJCullinan: but i'm not sure she wants to go out, we both adore eachother as friends, and she likes being around me just fine, but i just want to be as good of friend as i can with her
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: oic
BrianJCullinan: so even if someone else moved in and they got together i think i'd be fine with that. she means a lot to me; so much that i want her to be happy, so i'd never try and pull something bad on her, i'm just really glad i'm friends with her
BrianJCullinan: and that really is true friendship
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya it is. thats so awesome.
BrianJCullinan: like with you,i like you because i could be a best of friends with you as possible, and not fall in love with you so much that i would want an intimate relationship
BrianJCullinan: in other words, i'd go out with you too, if you wanted to
BrianJCullinan: i'd do it for you
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: lol
BrianJCullinan: and i'm like that with bridget too
BrianJCullinan: shes sweet and always there for me
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: ya

ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: from a girls point of view.
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: cuz thats how i felt.

BrianJCullinan: i see
BrianJCullinan: i should try to comfort her
BrianJCullinan: and be there as a friend
BrianJCullinan: maybe i should wait until next week to ask her out
BrianJCullinan: i can be patient
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: yaya. just let her know its ok to feel like that and let her express how she feels before u say n e thing else cuz she may be overwhelmed too...u know?

ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: k
ATraGicFaiRyTaLe: dont wait too long. two weeks tops i think.
