BrianJCullinan: yeah jeese people at a mall, go figure
BrianJCullinan: almost like they don't belong there
Efoehn: they dont  
Efoehn: they need to get out of my way

Efoehn: oh and i saw a midget  
Efoehn: that was funny  
BrianJCullinan: lol
Efoehn: when r u gonna put the band camp pictures on the website?  
BrianJCullinan: now
Efoehn: this very minute  
Efoehn: ?  
Efoehn: why do all the pictures suck on the website?  
Efoehn: they look like watercolor paintings  
BrianJCullinan: hmmm?
BrianJCullinan: that can't be
BrianJCullinan: your computer sucks
Efoehn: no the pictures do  
Efoehn: they are to big  
BrianJCullinan: now i can look at that beautiful girl all the time
Efoehn: thats scary  
BrianJCullinan: adjust your screen size
Efoehn: no my screen is fine make the pictures smaller  
BrianJCullinan: huh?
BrianJCullinan: your insane
Efoehn: the thumb nail pictures are fine its just when u make them bigger  
BrianJCullinan: don't they open in a new window?
Efoehn: yes  
BrianJCullinan: good please hold
Efoehn: the pictures are like 1000x800
Efoehn: my screen is 800x600  
Efoehn: they are to BIG  
Efoehn: if i have to scroll for 30 minutes to see the bottom of the picture they are to big  
BrianJCullinan: 1. Open and internet explorer window, Or right click on the desktop icon and select 'Properties' and the bottom of the menu. 
 2. In the internet explorer window select the 'Tools' menu at the top of the window, then select 'Internet Options...' at the bottom of that menu. 
 3. In the dialog display select the 'Advanced' TAB at the top. 
 4. Scroll down the list of options until you find the 'Multimedia' section. 
 5. Check the box that says 'Enable Automatic Image Resizing. 
  
 Depending on the version of internet explorer these directions may slightly vary.  The option for image resizing however should be consistent. 
 
Efoehn: ok no  
Efoehn: you just make the pictures smaller  
Efoehn: it was already enabled
BrianJCullinan: what?
BrianJCullinan: that cannot be correct
Efoehn: what size are the pictures when you put them on the site?
BrianJCullinan: Answer:  I apologize for the inconvenience, but because it would be a nightmare to try and resize every single picture, AND lessen their quality; please follow these simple instructions on how to set automatic image resizing.
BrianJCullinan: when we put them on the site thay are the same size you are complaining about
BrianJCullinan: your browser doesn't work
BrianJCullinan: go download and install a new one
Efoehn: then make them smaller before u put them on  
BrianJCullinan: no
BrianJCullinan: takes to long
BrianJCullinan: i have to resize every one of them
BrianJCullinan: i think not
Efoehn: i think yes  
Efoehn: get to work  
Efoehn: you start working while i go play warcraft
Efoehn: bye

Ericthepathetic: the first girl that sang in one of the first school assenblies
Ericthepathetic: *assemblies
Ericthepathetic: so shes in my math class right
Ericthepathetic: and i've been helping her a little bit, like on the last quiz, almost cheating except it was a really old quiz, and shit happens, but i helped her anyways
Ericthepathetic: so last friday
Ericthepathetic: not thursday
Ericthepathetic: friday i was all dressed up
Ericthepathetic: shall i continue?
Efoehn: yes
Ericthepathetic: and theres this other kid in our class Brandon, and he had a Fanta, she said fanta's are really good, and he said come over here and i'll give you a sip
Ericthepathetic: so everyone was like no, and she said i don't want to drink out of yurs, so i said come over here and i'll give you a dollar and you can buy your own
Ericthepathetic: and people were like oOo, and she was like ReAlLy?
Efoehn: go on
Ericthepathetic: and i was like sure, so i whipped out my $50, and she noticed the picture of my cousin on the front page of my wallet, but she didn't know that so she said whos that your girlfriend? (like i was trying to play two girls)
Ericthepathetic: and i said no thats my cousin, and people laughed, so everyone heard what i was saying
Ericthepathetic: and then i said, give me your picture and i'll put you in my wallet
Ericthepathetic: and everyone was like oOo someone trying to make da moves, they have been talking a lot lately
Ericthepathetic: and her boyfriend dumped her recently, so i thunk it cheered her up a little 
Efoehn: who is she
Ericthepathetic: but i don't think she new how to respond to all this attention, because she didn't say anything after that, just kinda smiled her pretty face
Ericthepathetic: her name is michelle
Ericthepathetic: kinda poofy hair, really good singer
Efoehn: last name
Ericthepathetic: very pretty
Ericthepathetic: i don't know it
Efoehn: what year is she
Ericthepathetic: i think a junior
Ericthepathetic: maybe a sophmore, but i'm pretty sure a junior
Ericthepathetic: so today i thought a lot about how nice and respectable it would be to go out with a girl like that, and treat her right
Efoehn: giving a girl money and being her bitch is not hitting on her
Ericthepathetic: i didn't giver her any money
Efoehn: good
Ericthepathetic: and i'm not her bitch, where did that come from?  i was helping a pretty girl out, i think she knows pretty well that i'm attracted to her, in a serious manner
Ericthepathetic: but monday i'm going to tell her, i'm sorry if i embarrassed her friday, and ask if she brought me a picture
Ericthepathetic: talking to brianna?

Ericthepathetic: as of now daniel has backed out
Ericthepathetic: two options, we write him an essay on why it should all stay in our room, and the benifits, if he can respond with a rebutle he'll put up with it, OR we exclude him, both pay 35 dollars and split profits two ways
Ericthepathetic: what you think?
Ericthepathetic: and we need to modify our card
Efoehn: why did he back out
Ericthepathetic: because he wants to take what ever he wants out and not have to pay for it because he thinks he owns it all
Ericthepathetic: and i told him what you said, we don't own it the consumers do
Ericthepathetic: but he wants a persuasive essay over the topic
Ericthepathetic: that fat bitch
Efoehn: so he dosent want to make money he just wants to binge on free candy
Efoehn: is that what he said
Ericthepathetic: i suppose so, but he also wants to take advantage of the amount of candy then draw in as much profit to his fat self as he can
Ericthepathetic: well not exactly but thats what i gather from his reaction to putting it all in out room
Efoehn: hes just to stupid to understand business
Ericthepathetic: i agree
Ericthepathetic: so what you say?
Ericthepathetic: we the only two
Efoehn: and how do we know his roommates wont steal it or he will give it away
Efoehn: if he doesnt eat it all
Ericthepathetic: exactly
Ericthepathetic: it's to risky
Ericthepathetic: just you and me then
Ericthepathetic: all the profit to us
Efoehn: i guess so
Efoehn: we need a new name now

BrianJCullinan: or was the total 67.55 in all?

Efoehn: BrianJCullinan (10:49:10 PM): damn i need to find some people to hang with or i'll go crazy    <---that is not a question
BrianJCullinan: BrianJCullinan: we doing anything before you leave?  <--------- that would be the first thing i said to you
Efoehn: oh yeah aol was being stupid
Efoehn: i said i was getting my hair did wendesday
BrianJCullinan: yeah so was i when i decided to take the band bus over the chorus bus
BrianJCullinan: and i said getting your hair did, doesn't take all day
BrianJCullinan: and there is still tomorrow
Efoehn: i didnt get that
Efoehn: aol was being stupid i said
BrianJCullinan: just forget it, i'll go places alone
Efoehn: i never said no
BrianJCullinan: you never said yes
BrianJCullinan: you never say yes
Efoehn: what do you want to do
BrianJCullinan: you give me the feeling you don't want to hang out, outside of school
BrianJCullinan: the only reason we talk at school schwas because there was no one better to talk to
BrianJCullinan: now i guess you found someone better to talk to haven't you?
Efoehn: ive never liked hanging out at anytime outside of school with anyone
BrianJCullinan: everything has been changing so much, one things after another, my girlfriend breaks up with me, i get a new job, i hang out with new people, i'm more out going then i schwas before, i watch the same tv shows you do, you show me the light of comedy, but i never thought we would stop being friends, i never wanted it to happen
BrianJCullinan: why can't you just put forth a little time and effort to maybe enjoy people, because not all of them suck
BrianJCullinan: most do, granted, but not all
Efoehn: when did we stop being friends
BrianJCullinan: we haven't yet
BrianJCullinan: and i don't want to
BrianJCullinan: i just want you to understand how i feel
BrianJCullinan: it's getting closer and closer
Efoehn: your the one that is changing not i
BrianJCullinan: i know
BrianJCullinan: thats why i'm asking you to put forth a little time, and effort to try and enjoy being around other people, some of which you may not know
BrianJCullinan: there is a lot of opportunity
BrianJCullinan: we have money, and transportation, we can do anything, understand?
BrianJCullinan: but you don't want to do anything
Efoehn: and maybe the new friends you choose will affect relationships with your old true friends
BrianJCullinan: maybe
BrianJCullinan: what friends are they affecting now?
BrianJCullinan: nothing is different between you and i; yet
BrianJCullinan: we still talk
BrianJCullinan: nothing is different between jeffrey and i, i still talk to him, i still carpool with him, when we get back to school i will still go out to eat with him on thursday
BrianJCullinan: that hasn't changed
BrianJCullinan: who else is there?
BrianJCullinan: no one
BrianJCullinan: thats what i'm trying to change, and i'm trying to help you too
BrianJCullinan: understand?
BrianJCullinan: should i stop trying?
Efoehn: stop trying what
BrianJCullinan: weren't you reading?
Efoehn: yes
BrianJCullinan: stop trying to make more friends and be more outgoing, should i stop trying to bring you with me
BrianJCullinan: nothing will change between you and i
Efoehn: maybe i dont like the new friends your trying to get
BrianJCullinan: you wouldn't know
BrianJCullinan: maybe thats the problem
BrianJCullinan: how could you know
BrianJCullinan: you don't get out enough to see the people i'm friends with
BrianJCullinan: you're changing too
Efoehn: how am i changing in your eyes
BrianJCullinan: you're always listening to carl's music, and talking to him, you said "thats messed up" reffering to hooking up with my ex-girlfriend, and now look at yourself, you have he sitting on your lap, you used to talk more, now hardly anything you say isn't an insult towards me or something stupid i said or did, now you're less accepting to doing new things like going out with friends
BrianJCullinan: are we doing anything this spring break?
Efoehn: first of carl makes me listen to his shit, i would never go out with brianna, i dont like people, and im a smart ass
BrianJCullinan: why don't you like people
BrianJCullinan: i never called you a smartass
BrianJCullinan: it sounds like you need to meet new people
Efoehn: in genral people are obnoxious, but the are good people
BrianJCullinan: yeah you definantly need to meet new people
BrianJCullinan: i'm not saying i know any better people, but i'm working on that, are you going to?  or would you rather just stick with being a smartass all alone?
Efoehn: why do you want me to meet new people be outgoing 
Efoehn: and what influenced you to be that way
BrianJCullinan: let me explain
Efoehn: let me listen
BrianJCullinan: not only are you a smartass but you are an incredibly humorous person, you should love to be around people because they love to be around you, and i don't think you understand that.  everyone that has met you has never said anything bad about you so why are you so against them? i don't understand.
Efoehn: im not against anyone i know
BrianJCullinan: and how are you ever going to know more people if you're not outgoing enough to meet them?
Efoehn: why do i need to know more people
BrianJCullinan: what influenced me to be more outgoing is the thought that all life get better, there are so many great people out there, i wish i could meet more people like me, yeah thats right more nerds like me, there are beautiful women out there waiting for people like us to walk into their lives, there is fun places to go and fun people to be around, but with friends like you there is not way to meet them
BrianJCullinan: why would you not want to know more people?!?!
BrianJCullinan: what is holding you back?
BrianJCullinan: why don't you want to make friends?
Efoehn: myself
BrianJCullinan: why would you not want to get out and just do something fun
BrianJCullinan: i know you go to concerts
BrianJCullinan: you have fun there
Efoehn: it takes a lot for someone to be considerd my friend
BrianJCullinan: then if you start now, you have that much longer to make them your friend
BrianJCullinan: you still haven't answered my question
Efoehn: whatdo you want to do?
BrianJCullinan: why don't you want to get out and meet new people?
BrianJCullinan: what do i want to do, i want to do anything and everything until i find something better to do, and i want you to do it with me
BrianJCullinan: you know when were sitting at lunch
BrianJCullinan: and a pretty girl walks by
BrianJCullinan: and i take a look
BrianJCullinan: then tap your should and show you
BrianJCullinan: and then you agree most the time right?
Efoehn: yeah
BrianJCullinan: sometimes i suggest talking to her
BrianJCullinan: and you make fun of me and say ask her if she wants to go to a movie and your mommy can come too
BrianJCullinan: right
BrianJCullinan: something like that
BrianJCullinan: haven't you ever wondered what would happen if i really did ask her out
BrianJCullinan: haven't you ever wonder what would happen if i asked her out for you
Efoehn: rejection
BrianJCullinan: you know, pointed you out, so one of those pretty girls noticed you
BrianJCullinan: haven't you ever wondered what COULD happen if you or i wasn't rejected?
BrianJCullinan: think of where it could go
BrianJCullinan: thats what motivates me
Efoehn: pretty girls dont notice ugly quiet band nerds brian were in high school thats not they way it works
BrianJCullinan: thats not true
BrianJCullinan: it happened to me
BrianJCullinan: yeah thats right
BrianJCullinan: to me
BrianJCullinan: saturday night it happened, and it was the best night of the trip
Efoehn: yeah by who
BrianJCullinan: haven't you ever wondered?
Efoehn: yes i have 
BrianJCullinan: you want to know what happened?
BrianJCullinan: it wasn't luck
BrianJCullinan: it may or may not have happened for a reason
BrianJCullinan: alright i tell you what it schwas
BrianJCullinan: on the trip, you could tell i was a little bit more outgoing, i wanted to walk around a lot right?
BrianJCullinan: and pass out the cards
BrianJCullinan: you noticed that right?
Efoehn: i noticed you barely hung out or talked to me
BrianJCullinan: thats not true
BrianJCullinan: friday we hung out the whole day
BrianJCullinan: anyways
BrianJCullinan: saturday back at the hotel after the zoo, i give one of those pretty girls a card, and the usual "stop by sometime, don't throw it away until i leave"
BrianJCullinan: her and her friend
BrianJCullinan: and i was kind of pissed because you let brianna sit on your lap, which i'm still mad about
BrianJCullinan: so i talked to jessica a lot, the one i was with before you went to the mall
Efoehn: but your so over that stupid freshman
BrianJCullinan: i am
BrianJCullinan: i'm getting to that
Efoehn: ok go on
BrianJCullinan: so her and i talked for like two hours, and shes the greatest person
BrianJCullinan: i would have never talked to her if it schwasn't for you being an asshole about letting brianna sit on your lap, so thank you
Efoehn: hey its what friends do
BrianJCullinan: so the guys walk up after you left, and i found out they were going to a comedy club, and i realize everyone left me and i was alone
BrianJCullinan: so then that pretty girl walks up
BrianJCullinan: and we start to talking
BrianJCullinan: right there is when it hit me
BrianJCullinan: i had to be more sociable, i wanted to meet more girls like her, and i wanted to hang out with more people like devins group
BrianJCullinan: they're not all messed up in the head like devin
BrianJCullinan: so i really wanted to go to this comedy thing, and because of that girl, and devin, and some of his friends, they convinced mrs. D to let me go, and i did
BrianJCullinan: the girl and i talked all night, the whole time i was getting the thumbs up from devin
BrianJCullinan: i want that to happen again
Efoehn: do you reaaly think its going to be like that when we go back to the harsh reality of high school
BrianJCullinan: that night was great, going to the comedy club was so much fun, talking to tons of new people was so much fun
BrianJCullinan: what makes high school different?
BrianJCullinan: there are so many people we don't know
Efoehn: from a band trip in cali?
BrianJCullinan: i've never even seen that girl before the trip, are you saying there aren't more people guys or girls are open and fun as she was?
BrianJCullinan: that was the point of the story
BrianJCullinan: it doesn't matter where it is, there are great people to meet everywhere, and there is a lot of fun things to do
Efoehn: im saying when she goes back to school where she has other better friends and what if she aks like you never existed
Efoehn: so you had fun for one night
BrianJCullinan: then i meet someone else
BrianJCullinan: that night was so much fun, it is worth trying again
BrianJCullinan: can't you agree?
Efoehn: no i cant i wasnt there
BrianJCullinan: what if i met a new person ever day, and i really found that person interesting, guy or girl, how many people do i NOT know?  isn't there enough people to meet the rest of the school year?  so the rest of the school year i am someone else i just met do something after school and have tons of fun, thats every day of the school year i have more fun then i could imagine
BrianJCullinan: now if every new person i meet, i do something with over the summer
BrianJCullinan: you don't think it's worth it?
Efoehn: when are you gonna have time to do important things with all this fun being had
BrianJCullinan: what is more important then enjoying life
BrianJCullinan: there will be plenty of time to keep my grades up and work
BrianJCullinan: what do you mean?
Efoehn: is this brian?
BrianJCullinan: you think i should stay at home, not doing anything but sit infront of a computer
BrianJCullinan: yes it is
BrianJCullinan: is this eric?
Efoehn: do i sound like a diffrent person to you?
BrianJCullinan: no
BrianJCullinan: do i?
Efoehn: yes
BrianJCullinan: how about 7 of those days i meet new people, i don't do anything with, except on days like these, on spring break, or weekends, i give them a call and spend my time having fun then, does that make sense?
Efoehn: so your expecting someone you just met at lunch to go somewhere with you after school
BrianJCullinan: well i would need about a week of "padding"
Efoehn: not everyone is going to like you
BrianJCullinan: don't you think someone will?
Efoehn: yes
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: so what if it was just 1 or 2 people a week?
BrianJCullinan: do think think it would be worth it?
Efoehn: im sure it would be
BrianJCullinan: then whats stopping you?
Efoehn: me
BrianJCullinan: y?
BrianJCullinan: thats not an answer anyways
Efoehn: because thats not the person i am
BrianJCullinan: y?
Efoehn: and i just cant change that because my friend had an elightening experience on a band trip
BrianJCullinan: i understand
BrianJCullinan: but don't you want the same experience?
Efoehn: ive been shy my entire life, i dont know why, and i can never muster up any courage to meet someone new, espically a lady
BrianJCullinan: omg! i'm the same way go figure
BrianJCullinan: don't you remember why we're friends
BrianJCullinan: because we have a lot in common
BrianJCullinan: i'm the same way
Efoehn: but you re-enlightened and have this new outgoing attutide
BrianJCullinan: i'm to much of a pansy to shave
Efoehn: shaving is a hygene issue not an issue of social matters
BrianJCullinan: its still something i'm not used to doing
BrianJCullinan: when do i start?
BrianJCullinan: how?
BrianJCullinan: who will teach me?
BrianJCullinan: my step dad?
Efoehn: at least you have a dad to teach you 
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry
BrianJCullinan: i didn't mean that
BrianJCullinan: sometimes i wish i didn't have to live with steve
BrianJCullinan: sometimes it wasn't good
BrianJCullinan: you know how i came about this re-enlightening
BrianJCullinan: Devin
BrianJCullinan: he was the one that the girl knew
BrianJCullinan: and she ended up talking to me all night
BrianJCullinan: is he more interesting then me? i doubt it
BrianJCullinan: since he did it for me, i'm determined to re-enlighten you
BrianJCullinan: it has to be passed along
BrianJCullinan: but you have to let me
BrianJCullinan: i didn't always want to be around him
BrianJCullinan: he does a lot of annoying and embarrasing things
BrianJCullinan: but now i understand that being outgoing like he is really paid off
BrianJCullinan: understand?
Efoehn: yes i understand
BrianJCullinan: then you'll let me help you be outgoing, and enjoy life more then you could imagine?
BrianJCullinan: even if it includes moving to a different machine at lunch?
BrianJCullinan: we've done it before, now there is a new incentive
Efoehn: no, when it comes down to it, im not going to move at lunch, im not going to want to walk around saying will you be my friend, im not going to want to change, and i dont know why 
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: if you won't move, i'll bring society to you
BrianJCullinan: would you rather have it that way?
Efoehn: how would you go about doing so
BrianJCullinan: i'm not asking you to take such a radical step, i'm just talking about, letting yourself be in situations that you might meet someone
BrianJCullinan: when jessica and i were talking that day after the zoo, we were sitting, not moving, devin showed up along with a few pretty girls, and i had nothing but opportunity to talk to her
BrianJCullinan: it wasn't that hard
BrianJCullinan: i went with the flow
BrianJCullinan: devin and i don't go around asking people to be our friends when we walk around, i go with the flow, he goes to talk to his girlfriend, and there are a lot of other pretty ladies that hang out with his girlfriend that i could be friends with
Efoehn: i dont want to walk around with devin
BrianJCullinan: there are plently of opportunities to casually atract attention such as dressing up for school and giving people your answer "we wanted to see how many people asked us that", that is funny, people like funny, AND it's a conversation starter
BrianJCullinan: how about something else, maybe a new spot
BrianJCullinan: how hard would it be to SIT in a new spot?
BrianJCullinan: away from carl and his shit
BrianJCullinan: away from jeffrey and mike and their final fantasy
Efoehn: because no one else is willing
BrianJCullinan: who else matters?
BrianJCullinan: josh will go to a new spot
Efoehn:  maybe in your new devine plan to find new friends your forgetting about your old ones
BrianJCullinan: old what?
Efoehn: friends
BrianJCullinan: old friends? i don't have any other friends, just you and jeffrey and andrew
BrianJCullinan: and sometimes devin
BrianJCullinan: what other friends?
BrianJCullinan: mike wants to move to a new spot, and so does jeffrey
BrianJCullinan: they want to draw you away from carl, personally i don't care, i just want to be friends with you and nothing has gotten in the way of that yet
BrianJCullinan: and a new spot is just one example
Efoehn: carl will follow
BrianJCullinan: thats fine
BrianJCullinan: there might be some people to meet in out new spot
BrianJCullinan: thats the point
BrianJCullinan: lets go see a movie or something tomorrow
Efoehn: what movie
BrianJCullinan: there might be someone we know there, along with people we don't know
Efoehn: perfect place to meet people dark room where your not allowed to  talk
BrianJCullinan: lol i mean desert ridge
BrianJCullinan: yeah there are a lot of stupid people there, but no more then there are at school, it's not that hard to ignore it
Efoehn: we can put on our von dutch trucker hat and go to desert ridge and be cool
BrianJCullinan: lol we could
BrianJCullinan: we could go to a different machine at school
BrianJCullinan: and walk on the opposite side we usually do
BrianJCullinan: inbetween classes
BrianJCullinan: and then spend more time loitering in places out of the way unlike stupid people
BrianJCullinan: do things out of the ordinary
BrianJCullinan: make life interesting
BrianJCullinan: you can't spend your life like this anymore
Efoehn: why not
BrianJCullinan: or you can
BrianJCullinan: i'll let you decide
BrianJCullinan: i'm just trying to help
BrianJCullinan: but you won't let me
BrianJCullinan: i'll call you tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to bed
Efoehn: ok
BrianJCullinan: just think about what COULD happen if you talked to Katie
Efoehn: i have thought about it
BrianJCullinan: if you made a joke infront of her, and she over heard
BrianJCullinan: and she became interested in you
BrianJCullinan: and before you knew it you were friends with her
BrianJCullinan: how will you ever know what could happen if you don't try
BrianJCullinan: and i don't mean really try hard, i just mean casually put yourself into a position where something like that could happen
BrianJCullinan: talk to you later
BrianJCullinan: have a good night
Efoehn: you too

BrianJCullinan: and they sit in the same vicinity as us just around one of those tree circular places that the mexicanos built
BrianJCullinan: i'm sorry but i'm going to have to ask you to think, just a little

 I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.  And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only I will remain
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to memorize that

BrianJCullinan: we can find people that need to exchange a lot of 1.00s to use in the machine
BrianJCullinan: and charge them the extra quata
Efoehn: yeah we can stand by the machine saying need change for a five, ten, twenty, well its gonna cost a quarter
BrianJCullinan: should we?
Efoehn: not charge a quarter
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: i have it divided up
Efoehn: did you minus the 8. 50 from mine
BrianJCullinan: i took 2.75 extra, so we didn't have to split up quarters, and when we bought the stuff i paid 3 more dollars then you did remember?
BrianJCullinan: yes minus the 8.50
BrianJCullinan: i have 36 dollars here for you
Efoehn: ok
BrianJCullinan: it will be 44.50 with the 8.50 you have
Efoehn: cool
BrianJCullinan: sound right?
BrianJCullinan: wait
Efoehn: how much do you have
BrianJCullinan: i have 50
Efoehn: what what what
Efoehn: why do you get 50 and i get 44.50
BrianJCullinan: you paid 34.28 (20 at costco, and 14.28 at slaveway, i paid 47.55
BrianJCullinan: right?
BrianJCullinan: you got the change at slaveway not me
Efoehn: i dont know
Efoehn: im trusting you though
BrianJCullinan: thats what the numbers say
Efoehn: ok
BrianJCullinan: my mom paid 8 dollars, so 4 dollars each is 30.28, and 43.55
BrianJCullinan: thats costs
BrianJCullinan: we made 94.5
BrianJCullinan: 47.25 each
Efoehn: ok ok i trust you i just want my money bitch im rick james
BrianJCullinan: yeah i think it's about right
BrianJCullinan: but since you owed me a few dollars it will appear you didn't make as much profit
BrianJCullinan: i wouldn't try to rip you off, and i don't think i am mis-calculating anymore

BrianJCullinan: i hate people
BrianJCullinan: remember back when we had that long talk about being more outgoing
Efoehn: yeah
BrianJCullinan: well, you were once again wiser then i.  i don't want to really be outgoing, if it were up to me, i would completely exclude myself from all society, and move to a secluded area such as the moon.
Efoehn: as would i
Efoehn: people suck
BrianJCullinan: they sure do
Efoehn: but since you got the moon id have to go to mars
BrianJCullinan: except for a very defined and select few people
Efoehn: yeah
BrianJCullinan: very defined
BrianJCullinan: like individual people
BrianJCullinan: we should write a book
BrianJCullinan: about the stupid things people do all the time
BrianJCullinan: it would be really funny, if people can laugh at themselves
Efoehn: the book would be huge
BrianJCullinan: just go with me on this, tomorrow at lunch, we should kind of just make a small outline, and then decide to do it or not, but we should at least make an outline
BrianJCullinan: i think the name should be "tangible thought" and i'll tell you why
Efoehn: ok
BrianJCullinan: tangible, is something that is touchable, the idiot mrs. kanter made us work on the concept for like a week, but really everything is tangible, even thought because it is mearly the jumping of charged particles and electicity throughout the nerve cells in the brain, and last i heard, cells, and particles were physical peices of matter
BrianJCullinan: make sense?
BrianJCullinan: the best part about it, is if i include that introduction, our book will already be filtering out the idiots right from the start
Efoehn: lol
BrianJCullinan: in our book we can discuss multiple topics such as how people try to "fake" themselves into being accepted in society
BrianJCullinan: or how completely oblivious people are, subsections being "walking through water", and "jumping infront of cars"
BrianJCullinan: another subject maybe how these traits of stupidity are being passed down to the next generation
BrianJCullinan: we could have broader topics explaining the stupid things people do at grocery stores, and the stupid things people do at school, or when they are around other people like at parties
BrianJCullinan: this would be good material for next years band skit, and we might make money
BrianJCullinan: nothing is worth doing unless it is profitable, and it sure wouldn't be that hard to write about stupid things people do, just like you said
Efoehn: you really want to write an entire book
BrianJCullinan: hey whoa, hold on coyboy
BrianJCullinan: i just suggested brainstorming a little bit, maybe drawing up and outline
BrianJCullinan: the way i see it is, if we do that, then a few days per month i open up this word document, and add in a few paragraphs
BrianJCullinan: eventually there will be enough there it could be considered a book, and i expect it will stay somewhat organized as long as we have a general outline
BrianJCullinan: i wouldn't actually put forth much EFFORT or anything
BrianJCullinan: just something to write in so i can stop thinking about stupid people
BrianJCullinan: i think it would be LESS EFFORT to write it down and be done with it, then it would be to keep dwelling and complaining about it
Efoehn: yeah

[04/26/2004 17:22:30] Efoehn: how
[04/26/2004 17:22:33] poopiedoobles05: she wasn't sincere

[04/26/2004 17:23:12] poopiedoobles05: she didn't really want to keep going out with me
[04/26/2004 17:23:35] poopiedoobles05: and the day before she dumped me i asked her if she was still interested in me and she said yes, well i guess she wasn't
[04/26/2004 17:23:59] poopiedoobles05: i need to shower
[04/26/2004 17:24:07] Efoehn: how was it more convenient to keep going out with you 
[04/26/2004 17:24:36] poopiedoobles05: because she didn't want to hurt my feelings i guess
[04/26/2004 17:24:57] poopiedoobles05: she wanted to take advantage more
[04/26/2004 17:25:21] Efoehn: take advantage of what

[04/26/2004 17:35:53] poopiedoobles05: i took her out, i thought i made her happy
[04/26/2004 17:36:05] poopiedoobles05: don't you understand why this is so hurtful?
[04/26/2004 17:36:17] Efoehn: yes

[04/26/2004 17:37:04] poopiedoobles05: do you really think that if i was not going out with her, and givin the same situations on the CA trip that she would have sat on my lap?
[04/26/2004 17:37:12] poopiedoobles05: no, she wouldn't have
[04/26/2004 17:37:43] poopiedoobles05: and she knew seeing you two together was hurting me, and she kept going
[04/26/2004 17:37:48] poopiedoobles05: how far will you let it go?

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Efoehn): Wed Apr 28 15:24:23 2004

[04/28/2004 15:27:31] BrianJCullinan: ho
[04/28/2004 15:28:04] BrianJCullinan: eric
[04/28/2004 15:28:10] BrianJCullinan: i'm sick of being ignored
[04/28/2004 15:32:53] Efoehn: sorry 
[04/28/2004 15:32:58] Efoehn: and im not talking to her 
[04/28/2004 15:33:26] BrianJCullinan: what are you doing?
[04/28/2004 15:34:00] BrianJCullinan: the more we exclude ourselves from the rest of society, the more disappointing it will be when we are required to become apart of it again
[04/28/2004 15:34:02] Efoehn: listening to music and i acidently hid your window 
[04/28/2004 15:35:08] Efoehn: how will it be disappointing 
[04/28/2004 15:35:34] BrianJCullinan: because we will be used to not having any stupid around
[04/28/2004 15:35:55] BrianJCullinan: then becoming apart of society again will remind us why we excluded ourselves in the first place
[04/28/2004 15:36:20] BrianJCullinan: but if we were always apart of society then we will have gotten used to constantly being surrounded by ignorance
[04/28/2004 15:36:37] Efoehn: yeah good point
[04/28/2004 15:37:35] BrianJCullinan: now we are drifting away from society, and the further we drift the more we will hate it when our job, future mate, or school work, drags us back in
[04/28/2004 15:38:43] Efoehn: then jump back on in i like it out here
[04/28/2004 15:39:05] BrianJCullinan: as do i
[04/28/2004 15:39:27] BrianJCullinan: i never said we should make an effort in being apart of society
[04/28/2004 15:39:44] BrianJCullinan: i just realized it would be painful when we are forced to be apart, again
[04/28/2004 15:40:24] BrianJCullinan: Jami is too perfect for works
[04/28/2004 15:40:29] BrianJCullinan: *words

[04/28/2004 15:47:07] BrianJCullinan: because you copied it wrong

[05/02/2004 11:38:18 PM] Efoehn: what are you doing
[05/02/2004 11:38:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: instead of making each expansion a separate ".exe" file, they have to make it all one exe and put commands to start each version on the end of a shortcut
[05/02/2004 11:39:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: since the install didn't work, i had to make my own shortcut, and i didn't fucking know the commands!

[05/04/2004 07:39:15 PM] Efoehn: why

[05/14/2004 11:45:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: well what the hell do you expect me to do
[05/14/2004 11:45:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't fucking understand why she did it, how the fuck am i supposed to understand a decision she won't explain
[05/14/2004 11:45:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's the only fucking reason i want to be friends with her, in hopes that maybe she will tell me why
[05/14/2004 11:46:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: but she won't and it drives me insane
[05/14/2004 11:47:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's why i despise her so much
[05/14/2004 11:47:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: she meant the world to me
[05/14/2004 11:48:28 PM] Efoehn: what exactly do you want her to explain 
[05/14/2004 11:49:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: why?
[05/14/2004 11:49:22 PM] Efoehn: why what
[05/14/2004 11:49:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: why did she lie to me?  why is it that when i asked her if she was still interested in me she said yes and then dumped me
[05/14/2004 11:49:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: why is it that we had great plans for that valentines day weekend that she would dump me 3 days before
[05/14/2004 11:50:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: why would she embarrass me infront of my relatives, when i told them i was going to take her out to dinner?
[05/14/2004 11:50:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: why could she just listen and let me explain how much she meant to me
[05/14/2004 11:52:25 PM] Efoehn: why don't you ask her 
[05/14/2004 11:52:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: if i could go back to that day, i would tell her that she meant a lot to me, and that i was sorry for expecting so much affection from her, i would remind her of all the times we were a lot and how much fun we would have, then i would ask her to wait until after valentines weekend, and i would prove to her how much she meant to me.  But instead she led me on, and then ruined in the next day
[05/14/2004 11:52:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah why don't i, what is her sn?
[05/14/2004 11:55:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: if she trys to evade answering my questions i will just confront her at school, if that doesn't work i will find a counselor to help me, i think this will be the only way for me to finally get over her, is find out what i should have months ago
[05/14/2004 11:55:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: when i understand what i did wrong, i will be at peace
[05/14/2004 11:57:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have no interest in helping me?
[05/14/2004 11:57:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: therefore only making it worse for yourself since you can't stand what i said about her?
[05/14/2004 11:57:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: that is fine, that decision i can understand
[05/14/2004 11:58:00 PM] Efoehn: wait
[05/14/2004 11:58:18 PM] Efoehn: im talking to her tight now to see if i can give you her sn
[05/14/2004 11:58:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: i have waited so long already, i have waited since the minute after she dumped me
[05/14/2004 11:58:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: all i want is to know why
[05/14/2004 11:59:20 PM] Efoehn: she said she is sick(and she is, not excuses) and tired and this would take a while and she would tell you tomorrow
[05/14/2004 11:59:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: tomorrow?
[05/14/2004 11:59:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: but how does she know what i want to know?
[05/14/2004 11:59:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is fine
[05/15/2004 12:00:08 AM] BrianJCullinan: i will wait
[05/15/2004 12:00:18 AM] Efoehn: you need to talk to her though

[05/15/2004 12:01:56 AM] BrianJCullinan: why didn't you want to see a movie with us?
[05/15/2004 12:02:03 AM] BrianJCullinan: we didn't go anywhere
[05/15/2004 12:02:08 AM] Efoehn: im not seeing that movie
[05/15/2004 12:02:29 AM] Efoehn: is envy out yet 
[05/15/2004 12:02:35 AM] BrianJCullinan: but if you were going to be up this late why not be watching an entertaining movie?

[05/15/2004 12:02:45 AM] BrianJCullinan: we weren't going to see that movie
[05/15/2004 12:02:58 AM] Efoehn: why not
[05/15/2004 12:03:09 AM] Efoehn: i would have gone then
[05/15/2004 12:03:16 AM] BrianJCullinan: in fact, had i looked at what was available, i would have changed my mind and gone to see that instead
[05/15/2004 12:03:43 AM] BrianJCullinan: i just can't stand being at home all the time, that is one of the few ways you and i are different
[05/15/2004 12:03:59 AM] BrianJCullinan: and i'm not going to try and change you
[05/15/2004 12:04:04 AM] Efoehn: whats so wrong with being at home
[05/15/2004 12:04:11 AM] BrianJCullinan: because obviously you don't have a problem with it
[05/15/2004 12:04:37 AM] BrianJCullinan: nothing is wrong with it, but i get tired of putting up with my brothers
[05/15/2004 12:04:52 AM] BrianJCullinan: i get tired of not laughing like i do when i'm around you
[05/15/2004 12:05:36 AM] BrianJCullinan: i get tired of not doing anything but sit around, watch porn, and wish i still had a girlfriend
[05/15/2004 12:05:57 AM] BrianJCullinan: it drives me mad
[05/15/2004 12:06:02 AM] BrianJCullinan: makes me apeshit
[05/15/2004 12:06:04 AM] BrianJCullinan: you know?

[05/15/2004 12:18:26 PM] Efoehn: why
[05/15/2004 12:19:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: her and i are a lot alike, when i was younger like her, i like a girl only because i knew she liked me
[05/15/2004 12:20:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: that maybe why she went out with me in the first place
[05/15/2004 12:20:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: she may not have been attracted to me at all, only because she knew i liked her a lot
[05/15/2004 12:29:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: so

[05/15/2004 01:13:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: 5 discs, 22 songs each
[05/15/2004 01:18:16 PM] Efoehn: just put them on an mp3 disc
[05/15/2004 01:18:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[05/15/2004 01:18:25 PM] BrianJCullinan: will it work?
[05/15/2004 01:20:10 PM] Efoehn: yeah i just need to know how to change the tags 
[05/15/2004 01:20:19 PM] BrianJCullinan: yeah
[05/15/2004 01:21:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: right click on the files, go to properties, then go to summary, the click advanced and edit the fields
[05/15/2004 01:22:41 PM] Efoehn: ok
[05/15/2004 01:23:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: do you still like kaytee?
[05/15/2004 01:23:32 PM] Efoehn: no
[05/15/2004 01:23:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: how come?
[05/15/2004 01:23:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: because you know brianna likes you
[05/15/2004 01:23:57 PM] BrianJCullinan: right?
[05/15/2004 01:25:07 PM] Efoehn: no, because i can get over things i know i have no chance with 
[05/15/2004 01:25:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: which is why i want you to take back your promise you made to me after brianna and i broke up about not dating your best friends ex-girlfriend
[05/15/2004 01:25:26 PM] BrianJCullinan: what do you mean?
[05/15/2004 01:26:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: what did you mean?
[05/15/2004 01:27:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: by no chance with?
[05/15/2004 01:27:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[05/15/2004 01:27:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: nvm
[05/15/2004 01:27:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: i get it
[05/15/2004 01:27:38 PM] Efoehn: i know i never have a chance with her so i had to let go
[05/15/2004 01:28:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: it kind of sounded like you were making a point about me getting over brianna too
[05/15/2004 01:28:23 PM] BrianJCullinan: and FYI, now that she cleared up why she did it, i think i can finally let it go
[05/15/2004 01:28:58 PM] Efoehn: back to taking back the promise thing, why?
[05/15/2004 01:29:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and if you have feelings for her, more then just friends, i want you to go for it, because not holding you against going out with her, would make her happy, and that's all i ever wanted to do was to make her happy, and letting her be with you, would make her happy
[05/15/2004 01:30:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: understand?
[05/15/2004 01:30:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: besides, i know you would take care of her better then i could
[05/15/2004 01:31:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: you knew she liked you right?
[05/15/2004 01:31:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: really liked you
[05/15/2004 01:31:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: seriously
[05/15/2004 01:31:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: schmediously
[05/15/2004 01:31:29 PM] Efoehn: yeah i know
[05/15/2004 01:31:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: then, go for it
[05/15/2004 01:31:49 PM] Efoehn: but i never acted upon it because i don't want to hurt you
[05/15/2004 01:32:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: and now you know it won't hurt me
[05/15/2004 01:32:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: i will always be attracted to her, just like i am with any other good looking girl, but i'm not going to hold it against you
[05/15/2004 01:32:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: go for it
[05/15/2004 01:32:52 PM] Efoehn: you say it does all of the time
[05/15/2004 01:33:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: because i never understood why
[05/15/2004 01:33:29 PM] BrianJCullinan: it's the question...  the question that drives us... you know the question?
[05/15/2004 01:33:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: we cleared that all up today
[05/15/2004 01:33:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: now i can let it go
[05/15/2004 01:33:48 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know where i went wrong
[05/15/2004 01:34:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: and next time, i won't make the same mistake
[05/15/2004 01:34:12 PM] Efoehn: what mistake is that
[05/15/2004 01:34:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: before, how can anyone learn from their mistakes if they don't know what mistake they made, but know i know what i did wrong, and i will learn from it
[05/15/2004 01:34:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: i just didn't take care of her
[05/15/2004 01:34:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: i was immature
[05/15/2004 01:35:33 PM] BrianJCullinan: i asked her for to much affection, i didn't communicate with her enough, and eventually she stopped convincing herself that she liked me, and broke it off
[05/15/2004 01:35:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: but dude, don't ask her out online or i'll kick you in the head
[05/15/2004 01:35:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: and saver the moment when you do
[05/15/2004 01:35:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: go for it
[05/15/2004 01:35:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: do it
[05/15/2004 01:36:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: just do it
[05/15/2004 01:36:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: good people deserve to be ith other good people, which is why you two should be together
[05/15/2004 01:36:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: you're both great people
[05/15/2004 01:37:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: and it is pretty obvious you like her to, who wouldn't, she has a great body, she is fun to be around, she has a sense of humor just like you
[05/15/2004 01:37:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: go for it
[05/15/2004 01:37:28 PM] BrianJCullinan: you won't hurt me
[05/15/2004 01:37:32 PM] Efoehn: did you ask her out online
[05/15/2004 01:37:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[05/15/2004 01:37:39 PM] BrianJCullinan: did you?

Efoehn: i thought you wrent going to flos
BrianJCullinan: when was the last time you had azn food
BrianJCullinan: well i wasn't going to go because i thought the movie would interfere
BrianJCullinan: but if it doesn't then i might go
Efoehn: what time is the movie
BrianJCullinan: but i don't know
BrianJCullinan: 9:30 at harkins
Efoehn: why that late
BrianJCullinan: because there aren't any in between
Efoehn: what about the 7:30 one
BrianJCullinan: amc sucks
BrianJCullinan: and we don't want to leave sara's party to early
Efoehn: so were staying 6 hours
BrianJCullinan: i don't know how her party is gonna be, if it sucks i'll leave early and go to flos, if it doesn't then i'll stay and hang with you
BrianJCullinan: no we could just leave and come here and play quake until the movie
Efoehn: i don't want to stay for 6 hours
BrianJCullinan: you have to play these older versions they're awesome
BrianJCullinan: i know
Efoehn: is jeffrey going to the movie
BrianJCullinan: we could stay for like 4 hours
BrianJCullinan: yes he is
BrianJCullinan: he wants to go to the 9:30 one
Efoehn: dos he want to stay for 6 hours
BrianJCullinan: but if you don't come over to my house then you're gonna have to get a ride to the movies
BrianJCullinan: no he doesn't want to either
BrianJCullinan: he will probably leave early and go play FFXI
BrianJCullinan: but i don't think we would be able to make the 7:30
BrianJCullinan: and it is at AMC

BrianJCullinan: do you understand the plan?
Efoehn: not really
*** Auto-response sent to Efoehn: I am currently away from the computer.
BrianJCullinan: if sara is feeding us dinner, i'm gonna stay
BrianJCullinan: if not i'm gonna go to flos, in which case you need to find a way home and a way to the movie
BrianJCullinan: if i stay, then i can take you home but i don
BrianJCullinan: 't want to drive all the way back up there
BrianJCullinan: OR we can go chill at my house and play video games and listen to loud music until the movie
BrianJCullinan: after we eat at saras
BrianJCullinan: then i can take you home from the movies
BrianJCullinan: understand?
Efoehn: yeah 
BrianJCullinan: or you can come to flos and eat with me
BrianJCullinan: try something i really enjoy?
BrianJCullinan: trust me that it will be good, because i like it a lot and we have a lot in common
BrianJCullinan: that is if sara is not feeding us dinner
BrianJCullinan: so i need to know two things from you now
BrianJCullinan: now
BrianJCullinan: would you want to go to flos with me if sara isn't feeding us?
BrianJCullinan: AND do you want to come over to my house when we feel it is time to leave her party before the movie?
Efoehn: i don't like azn food and just because you like it doesn't mean i do, but i would go to your house after the party
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: but azn food is good, i never liked it before i had flos either
BrianJCullinan: but now i do
BrianJCullinan: but i'm not gonna try and force you into trying it
Efoehn: theres gonna be lots of food and junk there and my mom is making this wicked awesome cake, so i wont even want to go eat chink chow
BrianJCullinan: because it isn't my place and it is to hard to convince you to do things
BrianJCullinan: especially new things
BrianJCullinan: when are you planning on eating this wicked awesome cake?
Efoehn: at the party
BrianJCullinan: oh
BrianJCullinan: what kind?
Efoehn: its a texas sheet cake
Efoehn: chocolate 
BrianJCullinan: then if you are bringing cake i should go get some dr. pepper?
Efoehn: isnt that what you said you were bringing
BrianJCullinan: yeah
Efoehn: well then yeah you should get some 
BrianJCullinan: but you're not bringing dr. pepper too right? just the cake
Efoehn: just the cake
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: then i should go now and get that dr. pepper
Efoehn: ok
BrianJCullinan: jeffrey is driving me
BrianJCullinan: and we're gonna pick up dr pepper
BrianJCullinan: and he needs to get soda too
BrianJCullinan: and this will be awesome
BrianJCullinan: he said we will probably leave together anyways around 7:00
BrianJCullinan: maybe earlier if she isn't feeding us
Efoehn: what am i gonna do if she isnt feeding us
Efoehn: jeffrey said the movie is at amc
Efoehn: nvm he lied
BrianJCullinan: if she is not feeding us then i will have the same problem
BrianJCullinan: i told them i wouldn't be at flos
BrianJCullinan: unless you want to go with us
BrianJCullinan: but we could just go pick up our own pizza
BrianJCullinan: knowing all those guys that will be there we will probably just get some money together and order some pizzas
BrianJCullinan: jeff should be coming soon
BrianJCullinan: so i g2g watch for him

[16/06/2004 08:41 PM] Efoehn: hi
[16/06/2004 08:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: so
[16/06/2004 08:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: anything going on between you and brianna?
[16/06/2004 08:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: i wonder what she'll be like next year?
[16/06/2004 08:43 PM] Efoehn: was that a question or a statment 
[16/06/2004 08:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe she will wear makeup and be more feminine and act the way other girls her age should
[16/06/2004 08:43 PM] Efoehn: she doesnt need makeup
[16/06/2004 08:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[16/06/2004 08:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should take a closer look then
[16/06/2004 08:44 PM] Efoehn: ok so you think shes ugly now
[16/06/2004 08:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: no, i just think that on special events makeup should be worn to bring out the better appearance of a girl
[16/06/2004 08:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: even if she doesn't wear makeup that is only one of the three things that i stated
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] Efoehn: so everyday next year is going to be a special event
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe she should act more feminine and act her age
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: did i say every day was a special event?
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: no
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: you
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] Efoehn: ok explain those now
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: re not reading
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol forget i brought it up
[16/06/2004 08:46 PM] Efoehn: no
[16/06/2004 08:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: all i'm saying is maybe she won't act like a little girl next year
[16/06/2004 08:47 PM] Efoehn: how does she act like one now
[16/06/2004 08:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: Eric, seriously, am i not explaining this easily enough for you to understand, i never said she was acting like one now, because i haven't seen her since the thursday graduation, so i would not know.  i am saying maybe she won't act like a little girl NEXT year
[16/06/2004 08:49 PM] Efoehn: well she doesnt act like one now 
[16/06/2004 08:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: when was the last time you saw her?
[16/06/2004 08:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: because she sure used to act like a little girl
[16/06/2004 08:51 PM] Efoehn: a couple days ago 
[16/06/2004 08:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: really now
[16/06/2004 08:51 PM] Efoehn: yeah really
[16/06/2004 08:51 PM] BrianJCullinan: well i just hope you are not blinded by your likings for her
[16/06/2004 08:52 PM] Efoehn: blinded from what
[16/06/2004 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: blinded from what is truly important
[16/06/2004 08:52 PM] Efoehn: you
[16/06/2004 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: your friends
[16/06/2004 08:52 PM] BrianJCullinan: the people you can relate to, the people you have known for a long time
[16/06/2004 08:53 PM] BrianJCullinan: what is NOT important is the little girl that will jump to the next good guy she meets
[16/06/2004 08:55 PM] Efoehn: brian thats not how it is
[16/06/2004 08:55 PM] BrianJCullinan: not yet, she hasn't met another good guy after she met you
[16/06/2004 08:56 PM] Efoehn: if you only knew brian
[16/06/2004 08:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: please, explain it to me
[16/06/2004 08:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: maybe i don't know
[16/06/2004 08:56 PM] BrianJCullinan: please do tell
[16/06/2004 08:57 PM] Efoehn: ok
[16/06/2004 09:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: well?

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:Efoehn): Wed Jun 16 21:04:41 2004
[16/06/2004 09:04 PM] Efoehn: its not that im a "good guy" girls dont like you just because your a good guy, its more then that
[16/06/2004 09:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: it took you all that time to say that?
[16/06/2004 09:05 PM] Efoehn: want more ill tell you what she said 
[16/06/2004 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[16/06/2004 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: please
[16/06/2004 09:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: do
[16/06/2004 09:06 PM] Efoehn: xxhappycynicxx (9:02:46 PM): it's not just finding the "next good guy" it's finding someone who you feel a connection with
 xxhappycynicxx (9:03:02 PM): does that make sense?
 xxhappycynicxx (9:04:23 PM): I stopped liking him when him always touching me and stuff got really annoying and when he stopped talking to me pretty much which was probably what made the touching me annoying; that he wouldn't say anything to me then grab my butt
 xxhappycynicxx (9:04:55 PM): and then I told him not to and he did
[16/06/2004 09:06 PM] Efoehn: its you, not her
[16/06/2004 09:07 PM] BrianJCullinan: i know i made some mistakes, and if i had another chance i wouldn't have, but i am not the only one that made mistakes in that relationship
[16/06/2004 09:08 PM] Efoehn: yeah everyone makes mistakes
[16/06/2004 09:08 PM] BrianJCullinan: then that is completely irrelevant to what i am saying
[16/06/2004 09:09 PM] Efoehn: what are you saying then
[16/06/2004 09:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: i hope she doesn't do the same thing to you
[16/06/2004 09:09 PM] BrianJCullinan: she admitted to like you before she was even finished with me
[16/06/2004 09:10 PM] BrianJCullinan: and she hasn't learned how terribly wrong that is, because then it is not just a mistake, it is immaturity not learning from your mistakes
[16/06/2004 09:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i originally stated, i wonder if she will be more mature next year
[16/06/2004 09:12 PM] BrianJCullinan: and this is probably the last thing i want to be talking about, the reason i asked how it is going between you and her is not really because i give a fuck how she but instead i want to be a part of your life, just like a friend should be
[16/06/2004 09:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i express my concern for you feelings by asking how you two are, i just don't want her to do the same thing to you
[16/06/2004 09:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: but of course i respect the fact that you have the right to discover her on your own
[16/06/2004 09:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: when this whole conflict started she told me she didn't know she didn't like me anymore
[16/06/2004 09:13 PM] BrianJCullinan: how does that make sense?
[16/06/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: what if she doesn't know what she wants?
[16/06/2004 09:14 PM] BrianJCullinan: does that question sound completely unfamiliar?
[16/06/2004 09:15 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean a lot of people don't know what they want

[16/06/2004 09:15 PM] Efoehn: these are diffrent circumstances, this isnt your relationship in instant reply
[16/06/2004 09:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: what makes you assume that that's what i am thinking
[16/06/2004 09:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: such a concept had not even crossed my mind
[16/06/2004 09:16 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think maybe you are a very confused person right now
[16/06/2004 09:16 PM] Efoehn: you keep saying shes gonna do they same thing to me as she did to you
[16/06/2004 09:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'm gonna let you sort this out by yourself
[16/06/2004 09:17 PM] Efoehn: i cant when your in the middle
[16/06/2004 09:17 PM] BrianJCullinan: i said that she made a mistake with me, and she doesn't understand that she did or why she did, which leaves the possiblity open for making the same mistake again
[16/06/2004 09:18 PM] BrianJCullinan: now how in that statement did i say that she was gonna do the same thing?
[16/06/2004 09:19 PM] Efoehn: you didnt, but how you were saying it before made it sound that way
[16/06/2004 09:19 PM] Efoehn: what was her mistake?
[16/06/2004 09:20 PM] BrianJCullinan: she started liking you before we broke up, and you said that it was more then just "meeting a good guy" when she had hardly even talked to you until we broke up, don't you understand?
[16/06/2004 09:21 PM] BrianJCullinan: how can you like your boyfriends best friend, and not think there is anything wrong with that, and she had hardly ever talked to you at that point
[16/06/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: i mean she is completely contradicting herself in saying "it is more then just meeting a good guy" because that's exactly what is happening, because she doesn't know what she wants
[16/06/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: because she is immature
[16/06/2004 09:22 PM] Efoehn: she did think something was wrong with that
[16/06/2004 09:22 PM] BrianJCullinan: which is why i asked i wonder if she will be more mature next year
[16/06/2004 09:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: fine, i don't care anymore, i tried to express my concerns for your feelings, because i was afraid that since she was unaware of what she wanted the same thing could happen again, but i just don't give a fuck anymore
[16/06/2004 09:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you don't need me watching out for you, now you have brianna and that must be all that matter
[16/06/2004 09:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: have a nice rest of the summer

[20/07/2004 07:11 PM] BrianJCullinan: so i figured that wouldn't be enough time, since i usually have to make plans at least a day in advance, i didn't want to be coaxing you into doing anything again

[20/07/2004 07:12 PM] Efoehn: how thoughtful of you

[20/07/2004 07:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: or we sell you our old 11mgs adapters for $5 each and buy only 2 wireless adapters for the laptops
[20/07/2004 07:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: sorry 4 adapters not 5, one will be hooked up directly
[20/07/2004 07:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: but the others are in different rooms

[20/07/2004 07:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: these are all one time purchases
[20/07/2004 07:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: and the $40 per month
[20/07/2004 07:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: it is still a lot cheaper then cox setting up your network

[20/07/2004 08:02 PM] Efoehn: i think need to go over every aspect of purchase and find out how much will be saved between cox doing it and you doing it
[20/07/2004 08:02 PM] Efoehn: write out a report and give it to him
[20/07/2004 08:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok

[23/07/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh
[23/07/2004 04:24 PM] BrianJCullinan: you mean to cable cable

[23/07/2004 04:27 PM] Efoehn: how
[23/07/2004 04:30 PM] BrianJCullinan: so there is only one split between the cable and the computer

[01/08/2004 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: i don't mind if you activate it, but the company might
[01/08/2004 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: i recorded on the highest quality
[01/08/2004 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: it's awesome
[01/08/2004 11:46 PM] Efoehn: what can the company do
[01/08/2004 11:47 PM] BrianJCullinan: pretty much nothing
[01/08/2004 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: spend lots of money getting a search warrant to search your computer and if they find the same account on more then one then they might be able to arrest you for steeling after going before a jodgue and presenting your case, and then a good lawyer will be able to stall the trial for at least a month if he to belive the virdict will be guilty, then of course your parents could bail you out for a small fee and tell you not to let it happen again
[01/08/2004 11:49 PM] BrianJCullinan: but like i said, that take a lot of time and money from the company, and your chances of that happening are slim to none
[01/08/2004 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: but that's what they could do
[01/08/2004 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: and i'm going to bed
[01/08/2004 11:50 PM] BrianJCullinan: good night
