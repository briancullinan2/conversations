[15/11/2004 01:48 PM] Tim: lol
[15/11/2004 02:04 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok i got it to work, but now, you know how if you put a space between value ex "1 2" you can use cin >> num >> den; to set those value
[15/11/2004 02:05 PM] BrianJCullinan: how to i override the " " <--space with "/" - slash?

[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] Tim: its wierd
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok lets start simple
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] Tim: how i have it set up right now is i just input 2 fractions, it adds them then outputs them
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: are the overloading functions being called?
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] Tim: yea
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok good
[15/11/2004 04:58 PM] Tim: i could only get the << and >> to work when called as friends though
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: yes that's correct
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] Tim: ok
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: they should all be friends
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] Tim: ok
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: because if they were enemies then the iostream would reject the overload
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok are they seperated into a .h and a .cpp file
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: ?
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should have 3 files
[15/11/2004 04:59 PM] Tim: yea
[15/11/2004 05:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: ok
[15/11/2004 05:00 PM] BrianJCullinan: then add the other overloads under the << >> and just change the signs
[15/11/2004 05:00 PM] BrianJCullinan:      friend rational operator+(const rational &x, const rational &y);
 
[15/11/2004 05:00 PM] BrianJCullinan:      friend bool operator<(const rational &x, const rational &y);
 
[15/11/2004 05:01 PM] Tim: k
[15/11/2004 05:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: they should be called like this

[15/11/2004 05:01 PM] BrianJCullinan: 
 bool operator<(const rational &x, const rational &y) 
 {

 } 
 
[15/11/2004 05:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: change the signs for all four, and the other four +-*/ don't forget to change the type
[15/11/2004 05:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: use the function he wrote of the sheet too
[15/11/2004 05:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: i hope that helps
[15/11/2004 05:02 PM] BrianJCullinan: oh, one thing that really tripped me up is the simplifying

[05/12/2004 11:40 PM] Tim: ...
[05/12/2004 11:40 PM] BrianJCullinan: so if the base class has an include, the other classes that include that bass class use it to
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: that's what tripped me up before
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: anywho
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] BrianJCullinan: i g2g to bed
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] Tim: ok in my main i have #include "CPublishing.h" then in my CPublishing.h i have none, then in Fiction i have #include "CPublishing.h" etc
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] Tim: fine
[05/12/2004 11:41 PM] Tim: ttyl
[05/12/2004 11:42 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmm sounds like it should work
[05/12/2004 11:43 PM] Tim: its not im tryin to do this
  CPublishing * hello
  hello = new Fiction
  
  and it aint findin fiction
[05/12/2004 11:43 PM] BrianJCullinan: should Cpublishing be replaced with fiction
[05/12/2004 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: you should use cpublishing
[05/12/2004 11:44 PM] Tim: CPublishing so i can call fiction or nonfiction
[05/12/2004 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: but if it is not finding it try include fiction.h and not cpublishing.h
[05/12/2004 11:44 PM] BrianJCullinan: that way fiction is including cpublishing
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: i think that might be the problem
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] Tim: but then what about nonfiction
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] Tim: i know you gotta include the base
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] Tim: cuz look at iostream etc
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: you have to include fiction.h because if you just include cpublishing how is it going to know how to include fiction.h
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] BrianJCullinan: tehn include all 3
[05/12/2004 11:45 PM] Tim: those are multiple inherited classes yet its only one include
[05/12/2004 11:46 PM] BrianJCullinan: try including all 3 see if that helps
