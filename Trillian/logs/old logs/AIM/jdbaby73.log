[24/09/2004 10:42 PM] *** Auto-response from Danielle: I am gone dreaming of a new place, a place where there is no pain, no broken hearts, no suffering, a place where every parent understands and loves you for who you are. A place where people can say how they feel and not worry about how another person is going to react. A place where you can be happy about who you are and feel beautiful inside... A place where I will be found, by your side.... that place is only alive in my dreams...
