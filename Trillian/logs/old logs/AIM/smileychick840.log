[16/12/2004 05:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: ''This article is about the television show; Friends can also refer to Quakers or, more esoterically, a brand name of a spring loaded camming device.''
 ----
 
 ''friends'' was a long-running American television situation comedy centered on lives of six twenty-somethings (eventually thirty-somethings) (3 male, 3 female) living in Manhattan.  The program was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television for NBC in the US, first broadcast on that network and followed by other broadcast networks in numerous countries throughout the world.  In the US, its first episode was aired on September 22, 1994, the last on May 6, 2004.
[16/12/2004 05:27 PM] Kristin: my bro has a lot of friends coming
[16/12/2004 05:27 PM] BrianJCullinan: In Norse mythology, Ull ("glory") was a son of Sif though not by her husband Thor. Ull's father is not named in any extant text. Ull was styled god of the snowshoe, god of the bow, hunting-god, god of the Shield. A shield is called the 'ship of Ullr'. Ullr lived in a hall called Ydalir 'Yew-dales'. 
 
 In Saxo Grammaticus' ''Danish History'', Book III, where gods appear euhemerized as powerful humans, Ull, under the name Ollerus, is described as "such a cunning wizard that he used a certain bone, which he had marked with awful spells, wherewith to cross the seas, instead of a vessel; and that by this bone he passed over the waters that barred his way as quickly as by rowing."
 
 When Odin was exiled, Ollerus was chosen to take his place. Ollerus ruled under the name Odin for ten years until the true Odin was called back, whereupon Ollerus retired to Sweden where he was slain by Danes.
 
 The appearance of Ull's name in numerous Norwegian and Swedish place names suggests Ull had a religious importance far greater than would appear from the scanty surviving textual references.
 
 Ull seems to be a variant of a wide-spread god of the bow, plague, and the wild represented in Greece by Apollo, among northwest Semites by Resheph/Rashpu, in the Vedas by Rudra and possibly in Welsh by Arawn.

[16/12/2004 11:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: (Link: http://www.wikipedia.com)http://www.wikipedia.com
[16/12/2004 11:03 PM] BrianJCullinan: An encyclopedia (alternatively encyclopdia) is a written compendium of knowledge. The term comes from the Greek words &amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;kappa;ύ&amp;kappa;&amp;lambda;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; &amp;pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;&amp;delta;&amp;epsilon;ί&amp;alpha;, ''enkyklios paideia'' ("in a circle of instruction"). This comes from &amp;epsilon;&amp;gamma;&amp;kappa;ύ&amp;kappa;&amp;lambda;&amp;iota;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf;, "circuit-shaped," from &amp;kappa;ύ&amp;kappa;&amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; ("circuit") and  &amp;pi;&amp;alpha;&amp;iota;&amp;delta;&amp;epsilon;ί&amp;alpha;, ("instruction"). Many encyclopedias are titled Cyclopaedia and the terms are interchangeable.
 
 Encyclopedias can be general, containing articles on topics in many different fields (the English-language ''Encyclopdia Britannica'' and German ''Brockhaus'' are well-known examples), or they can specialize in a particular field (such as an encyclopedia of medicine, philosophy, or law). There are also encyclopedias that cover a wide variety of topics from a particular cultural, ethnic, or national perspective, such as the ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'' or ''Encyclopedia Judaica''.
 
 Many dictionaries are encyclopedic in their range, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'', the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'', and ''Black's Law Dictionary''). Encyclopedic works have been produced throughout much of human history, but the term ''encyclopedia'' was not used to refer to such works until the 16th century.
 
 There are two main methods of organizing encyclopedias: the alphabetical method (consisting of a number of separate articles, organised in alphabetical order), or organization by hierarchical categories. The former is the most common by far, especially for general works.q
