[08/27/2005 12:21 AM] Megan O: and what makes you think you are so mature
[08/27/2005 12:21 AM] Megan O: besides the fact that you are a trumpet and are cocky
[08/27/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i'm not really cocky
[08/27/2005 12:22 AM] Me: i just say things that would seem cocky to observe people reactions
[08/27/2005 12:23 AM] Megan O: and i am entirely messing around
[08/27/2005 12:23 AM] Me: i'd really like to be a psyc minor, i guess thats why i do it

[08/27/2005 12:25 AM] Megan O: as normal
[08/27/2005 12:25 AM] Me: and i am ADD but thats no excuse to act immature
[08/27/2005 12:26 AM] Me: ok if your going to keep ratting on guys imperfections lets talk about girls
[08/27/2005 12:26 AM] Megan O: ok go ahead
[08/27/2005 12:26 AM] Megan O: i will prolly agree with all of it
[08/27/2005 12:26 AM] Me: why is it that they always have to be playing the game?
[08/27/2005 12:26 AM] Me: can't they just be honest?
[08/27/2005 12:27 AM] Megan O: the game can be fun
[08/27/2005 12:27 AM] Megan O: i am prolly one of the most blunt people you will meet

[08/27/2005 12:29 AM] Megan O: what mold would i fit into?
[08/27/2005 12:29 AM] Me: the perfect one
[08/27/2005 12:29 AM] Me: why do girls treat guy like dogs, even the ones that don't act like it at first will eventually be training into being one
[08/27/2005 12:30 AM] Megan O: theres a chapter in my book about how guys and dogs are similar
[08/27/2005 12:30 AM] Me: they make this automatic assumption that guys are only after certain things weather it be sex or to just have a toy holding their shoulder and then they turn around and take the guy for everything he has
[08/27/2005 12:31 AM] Megan O: not all girls are like that
[08/27/2005 12:31 AM] Megan O: at all

[08/27/2005 12:32 AM] Megan O: no
[08/27/2005 12:32 AM] Me: if they weren't i would have a girlfriend
[08/27/2005 12:32 AM] Me: the only sweet sincere guys are either gay or trumpet players
[08/27/2005 12:32 AM] Megan O: hahaa
