[05/12/2005 10:37 PM] Me: i trust them more then user accounts
[05/12/2005 10:37 PM] Jeremy P: because they are a liability
[05/12/2005 10:38 PM] Me: because then that faulty account shows up on their servers, and that's how administrators find you

[05/12/2005 10:49 PM] Me: woah it just connected
[05/12/2005 10:49 PM] Jeremy P: if you do you'll need to allow irc to access the internet trough it, and create several ports through your router
[05/12/2005 10:50 PM] Jeremy P: do you have a router?
[05/12/2005 10:50 PM] Jeremy P: ?

[05/12/2005 11:33 PM] Me: how do i become a server?
[05/12/2005 11:34 PM] Jeremy P: you have to set up omen serve to share the directory where you have your music files
[05/12/2005 11:34 PM] Jeremy P: and it will scan them and them use list magic to make your list 
[05/12/2005 11:34 PM] Jeremy P: and then you are good to go
[05/12/2005 11:34 PM] Jeremy P: just open up omen serve options and play around
[05/12/2005 11:35 PM] Jeremy P: look whats there
[05/12/2005 11:35 PM] Me: do i already have list magic?
[05/12/2005 11:35 PM] Jeremy P: any questions and ask me

[05/12/2005 11:35 PM] Jeremy P: yeah, its build in in omen serve
[05/12/2005 11:35 PM] Me: but isn't that illegal?
[05/12/2005 11:36 PM] Jeremy P: what?

[05/12/2005 11:37 PM] Me: BS
[05/12/2005 11:37 PM] Jeremy P: after 24 hours all users are required to delete there files
[05/12/2005 11:37 PM] Me: do you?
