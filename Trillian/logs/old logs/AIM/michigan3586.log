BrianJCullinan: your spring break will only be as good as you make it
*** Auto-response from michigan3586: I am away becuase I feel that I have no true friends.  Sure, I talk to a lot of people when I am at school, but how many of you do I really hang out with and talk to outside of school, or how many of you actually call me at home just to talk.  Well I can tell you, not that many of you.  So I don't really know who my true friends are.... are you a true friend?
BrianJCullinan: well mr. i will tell you a little something about friends, but why should i waste my time you obviously don't listen to me because if you did you wouldn't have written that away message.  a true friend listens to his friends, so maybe if you wanted a true friend you would start listening to me!  stop getting so upset  about being friends, and heving friends and maybe you would HAVE more friends!  that will be the last time i say that to you, and if you don't listen this time i am going to give up.  good night Andrew i will talk to you tomorrow...

michigan3586: r ur bros goin?
BrianJCullinan: yeah
michigan3586: so if u stay u will be the only one at home?

michigan3586: oh yeah
michigan3586: u should stay
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: and i have to see you again
BrianJCullinan: and we have to go somewhere together, where there is lots of people i don't know
BrianJCullinan: lots of people to meet
BrianJCullinan: lots of girls
michigan3586: maybe
BrianJCullinan: i just have a huge urge to be apart of life again
michigan3586: well if u stay u and I will spend most of the day tomorrow together
BrianJCullinan: i want to go out and meet people, great people, possibly some girls, or people to just hang out with, i want to spend more time with you
BrianJCullinan: but i also have to help someone you know, and i'm pretty sure he needs my help
michigan3586: well hangin with me is easy, the "girls" & ''other people'' will be hard
BrianJCullinan: it's Eric
michigan3586: y?
BrianJCullinan: we need to help him be more outgoing
michigan3586: thats impossible
BrianJCullinan: i'm the only person that can help him and i have to do everything i can to do so
michigan3586: well I wish u the very best of luck
BrianJCullinan: i can't wait to see you tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: it will be fun
michigan3586: yeah
michigan3586: so u gonna stay?
BrianJCullinan: i think so
BrianJCullinan: if my mom will let me, and i think she will
michigan3586: so what u gonna do all alone in ur house?
BrianJCullinan: she already suggested it before
BrianJCullinan: i won't be in my house that much
michigan3586: y not?
BrianJCullinan: like you said i'll be with you tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: i'm hoping i can hook up with devin wednesday
michigan3586: thats cool
BrianJCullinan: so were going to go places tomorrow?
michigan3586: I don't know I have to think where to take you
michigan3586: quick question
michigan3586: r u stayin cause of me?
BrianJCullinan: how do you want me to answer that?
BrianJCullinan: yes?
michigan3586: I want u to answer with the truth...
BrianJCullinan: how about this, i'm not going because everything there i have seen before, and i don't want to
BrianJCullinan: one day with you could make this entire springbreak worth remembering
michigan3586: ok then answer me this, if I don't hang with u will u still stay?
BrianJCullinan: i would probably stay, trying to find something better to do, spending time with you means a lot to me, and if we can't spend time together i will just have to resort to doing the next best thing, but thats still better then going with them
michigan3586: ok
michigan3586: I will still hang with you but I don't think that we will be able to find the type of people that you are lookin for
BrianJCullinan: what type is that?
michigan3586: well u wanted to fine the "cool" group and "girls"
BrianJCullinan: how about that girl, give her a call, and have her call her friends, there is 5 new people i don't know, and five new people i could meet
michigan3586: which girl?
BrianJCullinan: the one we saw tonight
BrianJCullinan: she gave you her number
michigan3586: jami?
BrianJCullinan: yeah
BrianJCullinan: then why don't we call danica, and paul, and gunhild, and see a movie with them again, it's been a while
michigan3586: well I kind of have a problem here cause I don't talk to Jami enough to hang with her and I need to make time for Tim cause we are supposed to hang over break
michigan3586: I think Danica is workin tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: then we can all do something together
michigan3586: Paul has school
BrianJCullinan: she works at harkins right?  lets go with tim and see her
michigan3586: and gunnhild is probally busy
BrianJCullinan: you could call and ask
michigan3586: I don't know I will talk to tim tomorrow and see whats up with him
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: should i still stay?
michigan3586: Like I said be4 it is up to u?
michigan3586: up to u
BrianJCullinan: i will
michigan3586: cool
michigan3586: I want to hang at ur house tomorrow
BrianJCullinan: sounds good
BrianJCullinan: lan parties yay!
michigan3586: u can do that with devin, for all i care you can hang with him all day tomorrow if u like
michigan3586: u don't have to do ne thing with me at all
michigan3586: I can always try to find somethin different
BrianJCullinan: i want to hang out with you
BrianJCullinan: don't start
BrianJCullinan: we're going to do something tomorrow even if i have to track you down
michigan3586: ok I was just tellin u so that you don't feel obligated to hang with me
michigan3586: lol
BrianJCullinan: i don't care who you're with
BrianJCullinan: we're going to hand out tomorrow, you can even bring your friend to my house to
michigan3586: If I hang with you then I will hang with you
michigan3586: not some other person
michigan3586: I have one small question for u
michigan3586: Are you goin to Ohio for college?
BrianJCullinan: i don't know
BrianJCullinan: i might, if i do i'll be back a lot
michigan3586: :'( I am gonna cry when u leave
michigan3586: I really with that you would stay here
michigan3586: wish
BrianJCullinan: it's ok
BrianJCullinan: i'm going to be back a lot
michigan3586: yeah but it won't be the same, you will make new friends and just 4get all about me
michigan3586: cause ur new friends wont be like me so u will be much more happier
BrianJCullinan: no i won't forget about you
BrianJCullinan: and i won't be happier
BrianJCullinan: i don't have enough friends like you
BrianJCullinan: you mean a lot to me
BrianJCullinan: and even after all we have been through we have remained friends, and thats the way it should be
michigan3586: yeah but u know that you will make new friends cause u will be by people that are just like u
BrianJCullinan: no
BrianJCullinan: not many people are like me
BrianJCullinan: it will be hard
BrianJCullinan: i won't forget my old friends, and last weekend was proof
michigan3586: yeah, if you go to Ohio then u will be surrounded by Ohio people and people that are into computers just like u
BrianJCullinan: i met a lot of great fun people, but now i'm trying to help eric too
BrianJCullinan: Ohio state isn't a computer school anyways
BrianJCullinan: and the schools there are better, i will be near the bottom of my class
michigan3586: still, u are still bound to find some person like u
BrianJCullinan: maybe someone
BrianJCullinan: but no one like you
BrianJCullinan: no one to replace you
michigan3586: u say that now, but u know that is not what will happen
BrianJCullinan: i don't know anything
michigan3586: well I wish I could believe u
BrianJCullinan: all i know is, i won't lose you as one of my best friends
michigan3586: well thats good to know
michigan3586: so ur mind if not made up about goin to Ohio?
BrianJCullinan: not really
BrianJCullinan: well
BrianJCullinan: kind of it
BrianJCullinan: i'd really like to go there but i haven't applied yet
michigan3586: ok well I know that if you apply u will get accepted and then I am sure that u will go so I hope that you have fun in Ohio
BrianJCullinan: but i won't forget about having fun here with you
michigan3586: neither will I, but I am just gettin sad that you will be gone in 2 yrs.
michigan3586: well now I am kind of depressed, so I think I will just talk to you tomorrow
michigan3586: or talk to you later
BrianJCullinan: don't be depressed
BrianJCullinan: i said i'll be back to see you
michigan3586: I am happy for u
BrianJCullinan: ok
BrianJCullinan: well i can't wait to see you tomorrow
michigan3586: and I hope that you do get in and go there
BrianJCullinan: i'll be up around nine

michigan3586: I feel really guilty for sayin this, but u r really hurtin me Brian... You have been my best friend since I can remember and I wish that it was still that way now.  I don't know if I am the one that has changed or u r the one that has changed or maybe we both have changed, but I just want to be friends with u, but that seems to be impossible cause u r not much fun, you just seem to bring the mood down.  I love the time we spend together and I will always remember that, but if things are not gonna change then I guess what we will just have to be the type of peole that just say hi and thats it cause I don't want to be wastin me time with u when nothin will ever change.  I give u as many chances as I can but if you do'nt try then change is gonna happen.  I love you way to much to see you like this and if u stay like this then I guess this will have to be it.
