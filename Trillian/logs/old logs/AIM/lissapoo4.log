[01/31/2006 05:07 PM] Me: Finish the CS Project 2?
[01/31/2006 05:07 PM] Melissa White: working on it right now
[01/31/2006 05:07 PM] Melissa White: just finished the questions
[01/31/2006 05:08 PM] Melissa White: you?
[01/31/2006 05:08 PM] Me: Working on the questions now.  Does the news article have to be focused around controversial topics, or can it be any computer science related news?
[01/31/2006 05:10 PM] Melissa White: i got the impression from the information that it should be cs news that focused on an ethical issue
[01/31/2006 05:10 PM] Melissa White: like for my last one i did one about how the RIAA and MPAA are trying to limit the media storage and copying capabilities of newly created media
[01/31/2006 05:12 PM] Me: Yes, I guess I will just have to look harder for a topic I am more interested in.  Like the constant feud between AMD and Intel, or ATI and nVidia, do you think that would be appropriate? 
[01/31/2006 05:13 PM] Melissa White: look for something on the new intel macs
[01/31/2006 05:13 PM] Me: Good idea, even though I hate Mac.
[01/31/2006 05:13 PM] Melissa White: bite your tounge
[01/31/2006 05:13 PM] Melissa White: mac is beautiful
[01/31/2006 05:14 PM] Melissa White: :D
[01/31/2006 05:14 PM] Me: Laff, you just like the pretty GUI that's all.  I'd rather use FreeBSD.
[01/31/2006 05:14 PM] Melissa White: pretty gui is good
[01/31/2006 05:14 PM] Melissa White: but mac has more to offer than that
[01/31/2006 05:15 PM] Melissa White: it is much more stable especiallly OSX with the Unix back end
[01/31/2006 05:15 PM] Melissa White: and mac is just cool
[01/31/2006 05:16 PM] Melissa White: what can i say i love it
[01/31/2006 05:16 PM] Melissa White: of couse... i'm also not a gamer
[01/31/2006 05:16 PM] Melissa White: so i don't have to worry about the fact that there aren't copies of all the games for my laptop
[01/31/2006 05:17 PM] Me: Nah, they only get away with the GUI because of the OpenGL chip, otherwise no one would use it because it would be too slow.  The Intel Mac and converting over to standard hardware with the x86 version of OS X, Mac will begin to receive a lot more attention from spyware and virus creators, just wait give it another year and you too will need anti virus and anti spyware software.
[01/31/2006 05:17 PM] Melissa White: which is sad
[01/31/2006 05:17 PM] Me: Very.
[01/31/2006 05:19 PM] Me: Apple would go belly up again if it wasn't for them controlling 80 percent of the music and media market.  Everyone and their mom has an iPoop, that's what is really sad, they have completely monopolized the portable media device industry.  Most people never even heard of a Dell Jukebox.
[01/31/2006 05:20 PM] Melissa White: didnt like it
[01/31/2006 05:20 PM] Melissa White: i have a video ipod and do love it
[01/31/2006 05:21 PM] Melissa White: apple has really gotten the hang of marketing in the last few years
[01/31/2006 05:21 PM] Me: I didn't like how it wasn't very well supported.  There are tons of other devices that can do just as much as an iPoop, but people are just so drawn in by their advertising ploys that they don't do the research to find and compare other devices.
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Melissa White: true
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Me: However the music artist knows their at an all time low when they do an iPoop commercial, when was the last time you listened to U2 or Eminem?
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Me: Pathetic.
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Me: Can we print out this conversation and use it as a news article?
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Melissa White: actually listened to U2 today
[01/31/2006 05:22 PM] Melissa White: i don't think he would like that too much
[01/31/2006 05:23 PM] Me: Laff, I'm sorry, did you enjoy it?
[01/31/2006 05:23 PM] Melissa White: adore them
[01/31/2006 05:23 PM] Melissa White: my favorite band
[01/31/2006 05:23 PM] Melissa White: love that bono refused to actually keep the money from their ipod campaign
[01/31/2006 05:23 PM] Melissa White: used it to endow the One Foundation
[01/31/2006 05:24 PM] Me: I use to like U2 until their new album, I love their song about giving to the poor and how after the album's release they were not available for questioning as they step off their private jet and into their limo.
[01/31/2006 05:24 PM] Me: Well I guess there was some good in them.
[01/31/2006 05:24 PM] Melissa White: always has been
[01/31/2006 05:24 PM] Melissa White: good lot of irish boys!
[01/31/2006 05:25 PM] Melissa White: not that i'm biased or anything (being irish myself)
[01/31/2006 05:26 PM] Me: I too am irish, I enjoy not being a lightweight by blood relation instead of practice it comes naturally.
[01/31/2006 05:26 PM] Me: Nothing beats bailey's
[01/31/2006 05:26 PM] Melissa White: aren't you a bit young to know that? :P
[01/31/2006 05:27 PM] Me: Of course.  What else is college for?
[01/31/2006 05:27 PM] Melissa White: lol
[01/31/2006 05:27 PM] Me: i come here to git smart
[01/31/2006 05:27 PM] Melissa White: sure sure
[01/31/2006 05:28 PM] Me: This really is the worst programming book I have ever read.  Its almost worse then a writer from Microsoft speaking like he owns the world.  I have an XML book that is written by someone from Scottland, it is amazingly interesting and easy to read.
[01/31/2006 05:29 PM] Melissa White: wow!
[01/31/2006 05:29 PM] Melissa White: that is amazing
[01/31/2006 05:29 PM] Melissa White: i have only read one book about programming or computers in general that was interesting
[01/31/2006 05:30 PM] Melissa White: one from the site csszengarden.com about css and how to refine it
[01/31/2006 05:32 PM] Me: I love CSS, I always strive to improve my designing skills thank you for the reference.  I have recently tried to create as much of my websites as possible in CSS and use only small repeated images to enhance the appearance.  Check is out (Link: http://bjcullinan.mine.nu/)http://bjcullinan.mine.nu/
[01/31/2006 05:32 PM] Me: *it
[01/31/2006 05:32 PM] Me: Of course there is a little bit of java script on the front page, but other then that all the highlighting buttons are done with CSS
[01/31/2006 05:32 PM] Melissa White: sweet then you will love the zen garden
[01/31/2006 05:34 PM] Me: I didn't know w3c has a built in validator.  That's so cool I am going to check all my sites for errors.
[01/31/2006 05:35 PM] Me: lol i have a lot of errors
[01/31/2006 05:35 PM] Me: :-(
[01/31/2006 05:35 PM] Melissa White: do you have the web editor toolbar for firefox
[01/31/2006 05:36 PM] Me: Not sure, I probably do I just don't know it.
[01/31/2006 05:36 PM] Me: Is there a link to download it?
[01/31/2006 05:39 PM] Me: How is the program coming along?

[01/30/2006 11:34 AM] Melissa White: yeah
[01/30/2006 11:34 AM] Me: is she online?
[01/30/2006 11:35 AM] Me: i want to harass her too, at random times during the day

[01/30/2006 11:37 AM] Me: but its better because it doesn't have a preceeding 'i'
[01/30/2006 11:42 AM] Melissa White: funny
[01/30/2006 11:42 AM] Melissa White: i don't use either
[01/30/2006 11:42 AM] Melissa White: i use gaim and fire
[01/30/2006 11:43 AM] Me: gaim and fire?
[01/30/2006 11:46 AM] Me: what are those?
[01/30/2006 11:46 AM] Melissa White: gaim is a linux based chat client 
[01/30/2006 11:46 AM] Melissa White: fire is a mac version similar to gaim
[01/30/2006 11:46 AM] Me: he needs to teach us shortcuts
[01/30/2006 11:46 AM] Melissa White: no
[01/30/2006 11:47 AM] Melissa White: people who haven't programmed before need to learn the pure language
[01/30/2006 11:47 AM] Melissa White: that way the shortcuts make sense when they learn them
[01/30/2006 11:47 AM] Me: yes, he has to teach us to think creatively because the tricks are what makes a program efficient, without the little tips and tricks we could end up making subroutines to handle something the API could do automatically
[01/30/2006 11:48 AM] Me: my C++ teacher never taught the shortcuts, but then he marked us off on our homework when we didn't write as efficiently as he does
[01/30/2006 11:48 AM] Melissa White: but for a foundation it is good to know how to write those subroutines
[01/30/2006 11:49 AM] Me: he could have just as easily thrown in the shortcut without me asking, i think he forgets a lot of stuff
[01/30/2006 11:50 AM] Me: but you're right, hes my professor i'm not the one teaching
[01/30/2006 11:50 AM] Melissa White: for proj 2 i first wrote it with the full subroutines to make sure that i understood what the api docs wer doing
[01/30/2006 11:50 AM] Melissa White: then i replaced with the api stuff
[01/30/2006 11:51 AM] Me: do you think he will count me off if i named the angle tester TestAngle.java instead of AngleDriver?
[01/30/2006 11:52 AM] Melissa White: it was supposed to be named Proj2.java
[01/30/2006 11:52 AM] Me: oh yeah
[01/30/2006 11:53 AM] Me: i hope he doesn't mark off
[01/30/2006 11:53 AM] Me: i named the angle Angle.java and the tester TestAngle.java
[01/30/2006 11:53 AM] Me: its all printed out anyways i doubt he will mark off for it
[01/30/2006 11:54 AM] Me: it didn't say in the directions until the very end where he told us to catenate it, compile and run it
[01/30/2006 11:55 AM] Me: When does the pay show up in an automatic deposit?/what day do we get paid?
[01/30/2006 11:55 AM] Melissa White: thurs night 12
[01/30/2006 11:56 AM] Me: noice thanks
[01/30/2006 11:57 AM] Me: standard expression is so awesome
[01/30/2006 12:03 PM] Me: see he does that in class the Test<classname>
[01/30/2006 12:04 PM] Me: what is the console variables in linux?
[01/30/2006 12:05 PM] Melissa White: what console variables?
[01/30/2006 12:06 PM] Me: see how his doesn't show the working directory in the prompt
[01/30/2006 12:07 PM] Me: its like $S or something
[01/30/2006 12:07 PM] Melissa White: ahh
[01/30/2006 12:07 PM] Me: can't remember
[01/30/2006 12:10 PM] Me: have you taken programming classes before?
[01/30/2006 12:11 PM] Melissa White: nope
[01/30/2006 12:11 PM] Me: did you use the Math.PI in your last project?
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: nope
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Me: how come?
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: that was easier to do the actual conversion
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: i've done so much trig that i almost knew it off the top of my head
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Me: how many digits do you know?
[01/30/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: the sin, cos, tan i used the math.sin etc
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Melissa White: i knew 3
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Me: oh
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Melissa White: but i looked up to 7
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Me: Math.PI i think does 20
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Me: but it doesn't matter
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Me: did you use a constant declaration for the PI?
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Melissa White: 20 is just ridiculous
[01/30/2006 12:13 PM] Me: yeah
[01/30/2006 12:14 PM] Melissa White: it is part of the rad conversion
[01/30/2006 12:14 PM] Me: yeah, hardcoding is bad though

[02/03/2006 10:49 AM] Melissa White: why?
[02/03/2006 10:50 AM] Me: oh... I think I missed my first appointment.
[02/03/2006 10:50 AM] Melissa White: when was it?
[02/03/2006 10:51 AM] Me: Laurel mentioned something to me in the office yesterday to cover Matt's because he was working phone, but I thought only 1 appointment needed to be covered and Keifer took it.  :-(
[02/03/2006 10:51 AM] Melissa White: yeah
[02/03/2006 10:51 AM] Melissa White: just don't miss the next one
[02/03/2006 10:51 AM] Me: Maybe Matt ended up taking it, he could have left 10 minutes after me, he was in the office all day.
[02/03/2006 10:52 AM] Me: Well, the next one is actually scheduled.
[02/03/2006 10:53 AM] Me: Laurel didn't accept me as her friend, I can't send a message to her.
[02/03/2006 10:54 AM] Melissa White: yeah it was your appointment
[02/03/2006 10:54 AM] Melissa White: the user called today and has to reschedule
[02/03/2006 10:55 AM] Me: Oh, are you at work?
[02/03/2006 10:55 AM] Melissa White: yeah
[02/03/2006 10:55 AM] Melissa White: i work 7-4
[02/03/2006 10:56 AM] Me: *sigh*, If only we had that interface it would be really easy to move appointments around when they need to be covered.
[02/03/2006 10:57 AM] Melissa White: you don't need an interface, you just need to clarify if you aren't sure who is taking an appointment when unusual siturations come up
[02/03/2006 10:57 AM] Me: Tell Laurel I lied when I said it would just make the SQL pretty, its really because it would be a great college to real world experience.
[02/03/2006 10:57 AM] Me: See you in class.

[02/06/2006 11:22 PM] Melissa White: not when you factor in the lower salaries up here because there is no industry

[02/06/2006 11:24 PM] Melissa White: i've read it like 4 or 5 times and i'm still not sure i get exactly what all we are doing
[02/06/2006 11:24 PM] Me: and the UML diagram is different from every other one he has done, it doesn't even match the same format
[02/06/2006 11:24 PM] Melissa White: you have to create your own uml
[02/06/2006 11:24 PM] Me: oh yeah i just read that
[02/06/2006 11:25 PM] Me: i skimmed over it earlier i'm reading it fully now
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Melissa White: i decided not to worry too much about the project until after the test
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Me: did you do the practice?
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Melissa White: i finished up the homework tonight and will study for the test on wed and then probably start the project thurs
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Melissa White: not yet
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Me: is the test wednesday?
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Melissa White: i printed it out
[02/06/2006 11:26 PM] Melissa White: no the test is on fri
[02/06/2006 11:27 PM] Me: ohhh i remember the next project is due next fri not this fri
[02/06/2006 11:27 PM] Melissa White: right
[02/06/2006 11:28 PM] Melissa White: well...
[02/06/2006 11:28 PM] Melissa White: i'm off to bed
[02/06/2006 11:28 PM] Melissa White: talk to you later
[02/06/2006 11:28 PM] Me: ok

[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Melissa White: ok
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Me: just ok?
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Melissa White: so so
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Me: did you finish in time?
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Melissa White: yeah
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Me: i'm sitting here with keifer and richard we just finished grilling
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Melissa White: i did the extra credit
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Me: we had like 9 people there
[02/10/2006 08:49 PM] Melissa White: what did you guys grill?
[02/10/2006 08:50 PM] Melissa White: where did you grill?
[02/10/2006 08:50 PM] Me: next to sechrist
[02/10/2006 08:50 PM] Melissa White: cool
[02/10/2006 08:50 PM] Me: we had mostly top sirloin, some new york strips
[02/10/2006 08:51 PM] Melissa White: i forgot they had some grills out there
[02/10/2006 08:51 PM] Melissa White: sounds tasty!
[02/10/2006 08:51 PM] Me: we grilled with season all salt
[02/10/2006 08:51 PM] Me: it was amazing
[02/10/2006 08:51 PM] Me: you will have to join us next time
[02/10/2006 08:52 PM] Melissa White: ok
[02/10/2006 08:52 PM] Melissa White: just let me know
[02/10/2006 08:52 PM] Me: ok
[02/10/2006 08:53 PM] Me: that would be fun
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Me: we should hang out outside work
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Me: work is so boring
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Melissa White: yeah
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Me: laurel can come too
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Melissa White: probably won't but worth inviting her
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Me: she sounds like shes got quite the crib when she was talking about her music collection and having speakers every where
[02/10/2006 08:54 PM] Me: yeah shes kinda weird like that
[02/10/2006 08:55 PM] Me: she might not like being around us outside of obligation

[02/13/2006 01:57 PM] Melissa White: why?
[02/13/2006 01:57 PM] Me: so my friend needs me to help her at like 3, but Laurel probably won't be ok with me leaving to go help her
[02/13/2006 01:58 PM] Me: how busy is it there? i will be at the office soon either way, but if its not busy do you think she would be alright with it?
[02/13/2006 01:58 PM] Me: i'd ask her myself but she doesn't talk to me online.
[02/13/2006 02:02 PM] Melissa White: are you supposed to be on an appointment
[02/13/2006 02:02 PM] Me: no i have none this week
[02/13/2006 02:03 PM] Me: but its either i go an meet my friend to fix her laptop or she brings it in and i fix it there, so it was kind of a favor for her not to have to bring it to the office
[02/13/2006 02:04 PM] Melissa White: when are you supposed to be in the office
[02/13/2006 02:04 PM] Me: soon
[02/13/2006 02:04 PM] Me: leaving now, i'll talk to you then
[02/13/2006 02:04 PM] Melissa White: if you want to leave to do that just let laurel know
[02/13/2006 02:04 PM] Me: ok cool c you soon!
[02/13/2006 02:05 PM] Melissa White: she might let you call it an appointment and make it part of work
[02/13/2006 02:05 PM] Melissa White: k see you in a bit
[02/13/2006 02:05 PM] Me: ok, the pay doesn't really matter, its for the girl *wink*

[02/16/2006 11:17 AM] Me: i have a question about the math
[02/16/2006 11:17 AM] Me: in CS
[02/16/2006 11:17 AM] Me: he gave us the example 5 + /53.13° as polar form
[02/16/2006 11:17 AM] Melissa White: ok
[02/16/2006 11:17 AM] Me: does he mean 5 + 1/53.13° or 5 /53.13°
[02/16/2006 11:18 AM] Me: because you can't have 2 mathmatical operators next to eachother with nothing inbetween 
[02/16/2006 11:18 AM] Melissa White: i thought that polar form was the X<Yi
[02/16/2006 11:18 AM] Melissa White: in that example the + denotes a positive number i think
[02/16/2006 11:18 AM] Melissa White: hang on let me pull up th website
[02/16/2006 11:19 AM] Me: i don't understand polar
[02/16/2006 11:20 AM] Me: (X + Yi) = R/θ°
[02/16/2006 11:20 AM] Melissa White: which example are you looking at
[02/16/2006 11:21 AM] Me: so the user input R and the Angle so i can convert to Y with Y = R * sin( θ ) is that the first input R * sin( Angle.toRadians )?
[02/16/2006 11:21 AM] Me: the project 3 page
[02/16/2006 11:21 AM] Melissa White: i know but where on the page
[02/16/2006 11:22 AM] Me: at the top under complex numbers
[02/16/2006 11:24 AM] Me: ok X<yi can't be right, you can take a range of numbers and multiple and divide them
[02/16/2006 11:25 AM] Melissa White: it is just the format
[02/16/2006 11:25 AM] Melissa White: when you s.o.pln it would be "<"
[02/16/2006 11:26 AM] Me: so how do you convert 5 + /53.13° to 3 + 4i
[02/16/2006 11:26 AM] Me: more simple what is R
[02/16/2006 11:27 AM] Melissa White: R would be 5 or 3
[02/16/2006 11:28 AM] Melissa White: R < Theta i
[02/16/2006 11:28 AM] Melissa White: is the format
[02/16/2006 11:28 AM] Me: what a stupid program
[02/16/2006 11:42 AM] Me: do you have to convert the polar back to polar numbers before butting it into a string even though it says x and y?
[02/16/2006 11:43 AM] Me: i guess not
[02/16/2006 11:43 AM] Me: i don't know
[02/16/2006 11:45 AM] Melissa White: sorry got busy
[02/16/2006 11:47 AM] Me: wow he is really not consistent
[02/16/2006 11:47 AM] Melissa White: yeah you do need to convert it to whatever output you are trying to get
[02/16/2006 11:47 AM] Me: b is 9/23 degrees != 5 + /53.13°
[02/16/2006 11:47 AM] Me: i think he is making up formats
[02/16/2006 11:47 AM] Melissa White: funny
[02/16/2006 11:48 AM] Melissa White: that just means that the beginning is zero so it would be 0 < 9/23
[02/16/2006 11:50 AM] Me: wow i am so confused, maybe i will bring in the final print out and we can compare
[02/16/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: ok
[02/16/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: i have my laptop today so i have mine
[02/16/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: going to lunch now though

[02/16/2006 08:56 PM] Melissa White: hey
[02/16/2006 08:56 PM] Melissa White: i was wrong about those ones that were 5/23 Degrees
[02/16/2006 08:56 PM] Melissa White: they are in polar form but they are r=5 and theta=23 degrees
[02/16/2006 09:29 PM] Me: what?
[02/16/2006 09:29 PM] Me: i don't understand
[02/16/2006 09:30 PM] Me: you mean the function that converts it to a string?
[02/16/2006 09:30 PM] Me: oh nvm
[02/16/2006 09:30 PM] Me: i see
[02/16/2006 09:30 PM] Me: yeah i got that, still want to compare before we turn it in?
[02/16/2006 09:34 PM] Melissa White: ifyou want
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Me: sooo want to e-mail me yur code and i'll e-mail you mine?
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Melissa White: did you get the theta as positive or negative on the second x
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Me: negative
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Me: it all matches HIS output
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Me: he lists the output on the page
[02/16/2006 09:35 PM] Me: did you do the rounding?
[02/16/2006 09:36 PM] Melissa White: i got the positve opposite
[02/16/2006 09:36 PM] Me: did it match his?
[02/16/2006 09:36 PM] Melissa White: no i didnt worry about the rounding
[02/16/2006 09:36 PM] Melissa White: did you
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: yes
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: did all your stuff work out
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: ?
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Melissa White: cool
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: and match his answers?
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: so did I, when you convert to theta you need to multiply by (180 / Math.PI) because the math atan2 returns radians not degrees
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Melissa White: yeah close
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: i got a positive at first
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: send me your code
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Me: bjcullinan@gmail.com
[02/16/2006 09:37 PM] Melissa White: some rounding errors but no big
[02/16/2006 09:38 PM] Me: yeah
[02/16/2006 09:38 PM] Melissa White: melissa.white@gmail.com
[02/16/2006 09:38 PM] Me: ok
[02/16/2006 09:38 PM] Melissa White: i gotta grab my jump drive
[02/16/2006 09:38 PM] Me: ok
[02/16/2006 09:39 PM] Me: don't copy my rounding exactly, there are other ways to implements it, i made a completely new function to handle it, if you want to do it just put it into the string function
[02/16/2006 09:39 PM] Melissa White: ahh
[02/16/2006 09:39 PM] Melissa White: i may try it
[02/16/2006 09:39 PM] Melissa White: i also may not worry about it
[02/16/2006 09:39 PM] Me: you will see it, in my code
[02/16/2006 09:40 PM] Me: sent
[02/16/2006 09:40 PM] Me: send me yours and i'll tell you if i find any errors
[02/16/2006 09:40 PM] Melissa White: got it
[02/16/2006 09:40 PM] Melissa White: shouldn't be any because it compiled and i got everything but that last answer right
[02/16/2006 09:41 PM] Me: hmm i'll see if i can figure it out for ya
[02/16/2006 09:41 PM] Melissa White: thanks
[02/16/2006 09:42 PM] Melissa White: sent
[02/16/2006 09:42 PM] Me: shoot i forgot my UML
[02/16/2006 09:43 PM] Melissa White: oh crap i didnt' print mine either
[02/16/2006 09:45 PM] Me: wow i think we did the exact opposite of eachother
[02/16/2006 09:45 PM] Melissa White: really?
[02/16/2006 09:45 PM] Me: yeah funny
[02/16/2006 09:46 PM] Melissa White: think about how you look at it... from a programing background 
[02/16/2006 09:46 PM] Melissa White: i look at it from knowing dfferent languges (spoken) and different logic
[02/16/2006 09:46 PM] Me: well neither is wrong
[02/16/2006 09:47 PM] Me: you used variables r and theta, i used x and y
[02/16/2006 09:47 PM] Me: yours is the more complicated way i think
[02/16/2006 09:47 PM] Melissa White: i've used r and theta a lot more in the classes that i have taken
[02/16/2006 09:47 PM] Me: yeah
[02/16/2006 09:47 PM] Me: that's good then
[02/16/2006 09:49 PM] Me: i don't understand this line here
       return new Complex( getR() * other.getR() , getTheta().plus( other.getTheta() ) );
[02/16/2006 09:50 PM] Me: shouldn't you just add thetaValue.getDegrees() + other.thetaValue.getDegrees()
[02/16/2006 09:50 PM] Melissa White: i'm uusing the angle class
[02/16/2006 09:50 PM] Melissa White: it gave a compile error when i had it like that
[02/16/2006 09:51 PM] Me: yeah but other.getTheta is referring to the entire angle returned by getTheta, not a number
[02/16/2006 09:51 PM] Me: oh
[02/16/2006 09:52 PM] Me: nvm the plus angle class takes an angle input
[02/16/2006 09:52 PM] Me: so what it might be doing instead is in your Angle class, its not returning a negative
[02/16/2006 09:53 PM] Melissa White: ahh
[02/16/2006 09:58 PM] Melissa White: so hey, i never got a chance to ask the other day
[02/16/2006 09:58 PM] Melissa White: how did the fixing of "the girl's" computer go?
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: oh
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: she has a boyfriend
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: :-(
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: kinda
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Melissa White: suck
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: <- no chance
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: hes older
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: shes older
[02/16/2006 09:59 PM] Me: i like older women
[02/16/2006 10:00 PM] Me: i'm thinking about adapting your toString where it checks for a negative or positive but it might be to obvious that we traded code if not many other people did that
[02/16/2006 10:00 PM] Me: so i guess i'll just leave it
[02/16/2006 10:01 PM] Melissa White: yeah i was thinking about that when i was looking at your rounding stuff
[02/16/2006 10:01 PM] Melissa White: especially since we have almost opposite styles in the programming
[02/16/2006 10:01 PM] Me: yeah
[02/16/2006 10:01 PM] Me: i like your style
[02/16/2006 10:02 PM] Me: you space things out
[02/16/2006 10:02 PM] Me: i try to fit as much function all on one line
[02/16/2006 10:02 PM] Melissa White: i'm a designer...
[02/16/2006 10:02 PM] Melissa White: pretty is more important than the rest
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Me: yeah
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Me: what is the delete command?
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Melissa White: in vim?
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Me: in console 
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Melissa White: x for one character
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Me: not vim
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Melissa White: to delete a full document
[02/16/2006 10:03 PM] Me: delete file
[02/16/2006 10:04 PM] Melissa White: rm filename
[02/16/2006 10:04 PM] Me: thanks, i always forgot that one
[02/16/2006 10:04 PM] Me: i found out how to customize your prompt variable
[02/16/2006 10:04 PM] Me: stupid thing won't change though
[02/16/2006 10:04 PM] Melissa White: oh cool that you found it suck though that it won't change

[02/17/2006 11:32 AM] Melissa White: for clean access?
[02/17/2006 11:33 AM] Melissa White: should be pretty easy
[02/17/2006 11:33 AM] Melissa White: you can install them manually if they are just not being found on the windows update page
[02/17/2006 11:34 AM] Me: yeah unless the updater freezes
[02/17/2006 11:34 AM] Melissa White: use perfigo to see which ones they are missing
[02/17/2006 11:34 AM] Me: yeah
[02/17/2006 11:34 AM] Melissa White: if the updater is bad then it is a walk-in appt and most likely a reinstall of windows
[02/17/2006 11:34 AM] Me: ok

[02/22/2006 11:40 AM] Melissa White: depends on how many hours you work

[02/22/2006 11:42 AM] Melissa White: i don't know

[02/22/2006 11:49 AM] Me: yes

[02/22/2006 11:49 AM] Me: i always find a way to fill it up

[02/22/2006 11:50 AM] Melissa White: damn!

[02/22/2006 11:50 AM] Melissa White: but i have been working to overcome it
[02/22/2006 11:50 AM] Me: why overcome it, just get a server!
[02/22/2006 11:51 AM] Me: by the end of next semester i want to be sharing over 2TB]
[02/22/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: i'm not just digitally pack rat-ish though
[02/22/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: holy crap!!
[02/22/2006 11:51 AM] Melissa White: i am setting up a server at my house with my tax refund
[02/22/2006 11:52 AM] Me: and i am building my assets, i am going to be managing my dad servers so i will probably own some bandwidth and start up some game servers
[02/22/2006 11:52 AM] Melissa White: fun
[02/22/2006 11:52 AM] Me: a tax refund server? whats the point of that?
[02/22/2006 11:53 AM] Melissa White: tax refund provides $$$ to buy components
[02/22/2006 11:53 AM] Me: yeah so why do you need a tax refund server?
[02/22/2006 11:53 AM] Me: you mean they pay you to host their service?
[02/22/2006 11:53 AM] Melissa White: i am setting up my own personal server
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Me: oh
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: so i need to get another computer going
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Me: yeah hows that working out?
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: haven't started on it yet
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Me: oh, need any help?
[02/22/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: pretty much planned just need to get my refund back to get the stuff
[02/22/2006 11:55 AM] Melissa White: not as of yet on the help but i know where to look if i do
[02/22/2006 11:55 AM] Me: yeah, what good stuff are you getting? 500GB seagate SATA 3GB/s transfer with 16MB buffer?  AMD X2?
[02/22/2006 11:56 AM] Me: that's what i would get
[02/22/2006 11:58 AM] Melissa White: starting with 250 and then adding in from there
[02/22/2006 11:59 AM] Me: lol k good idea
[02/22/2006 11:59 AM] Melissa White: i don't know which Athlon i'm going with yet a lot based on $
[02/22/2006 11:59 AM] Me: what motherboard?
[02/22/2006 11:59 AM] Melissa White: depends on chip
[02/22/2006 12:00 PM] Me: yeah make sure you match up sockets
[02/22/2006 12:00 PM] Melissa White: can't remember the brand that i priced but it had different ones for all of the amd chips
[02/22/2006 12:00 PM] Me: i would go with a AMD socket 939, because there is a 3800 non dual core, then if you decide to spend a little more later and get a dual core you could even use up to the 4800 socket 939
[02/22/2006 12:01 PM] Me: my favorite motherboard manufacturer is ASUS, something about built in 5.1 8 channel audio and dual gigabit ethernet and 10 USB ports is incredibly appealing

[03/02/2006 08:18 AM] Me: you're just one person

[03/02/2006 08:19 AM] Melissa White: i have the voices under control

[03/02/2006 08:19 AM] Me: oh ok good
[03/02/2006 08:19 AM] Melissa White: what's up?
[03/02/2006 08:19 AM] Me: what if we have an appointment made with a problem we haven't been able to fix ever
[03/02/2006 08:20 AM] Me: i'm not going to be much use to that person when we can't fix the problem in the office
[03/02/2006 08:20 AM] Melissa White: what is the issue?
[03/02/2006 08:21 AM] Me: the thing with mcaffee where the virus ruins the installation and there is no way to uninstall but it still loads just fine, there is no way to reinstall because the services are loaded, and CCAA doesn't detect that its installed
[03/02/2006 08:22 AM] Melissa White: on that have you tried installing a new copy of mcaffee over the old and then uninstalling that one (sometimes it fills in the gaps and then allows a full uninstall)
[03/02/2006 08:23 AM] Me: yeah it says in the report that it can't reinstall
[03/02/2006 08:23 AM] Me: or uninstall
[03/02/2006 08:23 AM] Me: everytime he tries to get mcafee running good it stops on "starting services" 
  
 begins to install on computer then cuts off, can see icon in corner etc. but CCAA still doesn"t detect it 
  
 tried uninstalling and re-installing
[03/02/2006 08:24 AM] Melissa White: are you at the appointment now?
[03/02/2006 08:24 AM] Me: no not until tomorrow
[03/02/2006 08:24 AM] Melissa White: oh ok
[03/02/2006 08:25 AM] Me: in the office i don't think we have ever fixed it, we just let it sit there until we get bored of looking at it
[03/02/2006 08:25 AM] Melissa White: ahh
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Me: i think john fixed one but he spent hours one night searching for and removing every single registry key he thought mcaffee installed
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] *** Melissa White is trying to send you "VirusScan.zip".
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] *** You have received C:\Program Files\Trillian\users\default\downloads\AIM\BrianJCullinan\VirusScan.zip.
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Me: i tried it
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Melissa White: there's a file in here that is supposed to do removals
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Me: doesn't remove services
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Melissa White: oh i did't hear that is doesn't work
[03/02/2006 08:26 AM] Me: yeah i spent 8 hours in the office one day trying to fix this problem
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Melissa White: on those have you tried just installing AVG and just disabling everything you could in mcafee
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Me: heaven forbid mcaffee supply a remover like awesome symantec does
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Melissa White: thats what the zip file is supposed to do
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Melissa White: but obviously not what it actually does
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Me: on one i tried installing AVG but it could get all the the way through the install either
[03/02/2006 08:27 AM] Me: *couldn't
[03/02/2006 08:28 AM] Melissa White: ok
[03/02/2006 08:28 AM] Me: but i will try it on this one

[03/03/2006 11:38 AM] Melissa White: ahh

[03/03/2006 11:43 AM] Melissa White: when they are controlled by humans they do
[03/03/2006 11:43 AM] Melissa White: what is the saying... "a computer is only as smart as its user"
[03/03/2006 11:43 AM] Melissa White: there would still be mistakes
[03/03/2006 11:43 AM] Melissa White: what would happen if your mind started to wander?
[03/03/2006 11:44 AM] Melissa White: or if you thought about the wrong thing
[03/03/2006 11:44 AM] Melissa White: then the computer would have the wrong imput
[03/03/2006 11:46 AM] Me: then i will be able to access the internet and immediately formulate an essay on why the mistake was good and progressive

[03/16/2006 11:32 AM] Me: Yeah dude, you're right, shes pissed
[03/16/2006 11:32 AM] Me: lol
[03/16/2006 11:33 AM] Me: women are so difficult
[03/16/2006 11:33 AM] Melissa White: glad you brought it up now?
[03/16/2006 11:33 AM] Me: eh
[03/16/2006 11:33 AM] Me: not sure yet
[03/16/2006 11:34 AM] Melissa White: instead of having to deal with it while you are relaxing over spring break
[03/16/2006 11:34 AM] Me: eh maybe
[03/16/2006 11:34 AM] Me: ok would it be bad if she didn't come and i took my girlfriend here to the show i was going to see with Amy?
[03/16/2006 11:37 AM] Me: wasn't it you that said that we have to live in the moment?  take what we can get?  distance brings you closer together and make you want it even more.  atleast that's what this did for me
 [03/16/2006 11:36 AM] Amy Root: "Im falling fast for you"  "And I'll catch you"  you missed and i fell flat on my face
[03/16/2006 11:37 AM] Me: shes scary when shes mad
[03/16/2006 11:42 AM] Me: dude i feel bad kinda
[03/16/2006 11:44 AM] Melissa White: sorry for ignoring for a sec 2 crazy calls
[03/16/2006 11:45 AM] Melissa White: It wouldn't be bad if you take chrisine(is that her name) to the show if its a show you 2 want to see
[03/16/2006 11:45 AM] Me: yeah she would love to go
[03/16/2006 11:46 AM] Melissa White: if you're just going to the show because you feel like you should then maybe you shouldn't
[03/16/2006 11:46 AM] Melissa White: is it christine
[03/16/2006 11:46 AM] Me: Christina
[03/16/2006 11:48 AM] Me: what do you mean?  I want to go to the show
[03/16/2006 11:53 AM] Melissa White: ok
[03/16/2006 11:53 AM] Melissa White: then you should go to the show
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: wether it is with amy or christina that is up to you
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Me: well i think she is probably going to come out
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Me: shes acting like this is a terrible break up
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Me: we haven't even spent that much time together
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: honestly if i were christina and you took amy i would be a little upset but could probably get over it knowing the situation
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Me: in person
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Melissa White: it IS a terrible break up in her mind
[03/16/2006 11:54 AM] Me: yeah, why?
[03/16/2006 11:55 AM] Me: we spent 3 days together and talk online
[03/16/2006 11:55 AM] Melissa White: because you weren't straight with her about what is going on
[03/16/2006 11:55 AM] Me: shes emotionally unstable and i'm not helping
[03/16/2006 11:55 AM] Melissa White: why is she emotionally unstable
[03/16/2006 11:55 AM] Melissa White: is this a new thing?
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: not sure
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: no
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: shes always been like this
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: i'm so dumb
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Melissa White: ahh
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: i should never have told her i wanted to date her this summer
[03/16/2006 11:56 AM] Me: that was my mistake
[03/16/2006 11:57 AM] Me: like in middle school she said she wanted to marry this friend of mine, and last night she told me that and admitted to being nieve, when that's almost the same thing happening here
[03/16/2006 11:57 AM] Me: freshmen in college do not get married
[03/16/2006 11:58 AM] Me: junior, sophmore maybe, but how can you expect that kind of relationship just when an entire new phase of your life is starting
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Me: Christina is completely understanding, shes wonderful
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Melissa White: many girls are programed to want to get married
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Melissa White: from 16 on
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Me: lol
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Me: why?
[03/16/2006 11:59 AM] Melissa White: it seems to be a disease
[03/16/2006 12:00 PM] Melissa White: i blame society
[03/16/2006 12:00 PM] Me: it sucks
[03/16/2006 12:00 PM] Me: either way it will all turn out right, because i will still have Christina
[03/16/2006 12:01 PM] Me: she completely understands i just want to be friends with Amy, and i am completely devoted to Christina
[03/16/2006 12:01 PM] Me: hey i have an idea
[03/16/2006 12:01 PM] Melissa White: make sure that you keep communication about the amy situation open between you and christina or you will not have christina in the end
[03/16/2006 12:02 PM] Me: i know, and i am
[03/16/2006 12:03 PM] Me: the monday we get back Christina wants me to take her out on a date, so i thought i'd dress up nice, but not too nice, tommy shirt and jean pants, and i would bring her a rose, i think her parents will be there then, so if i plan it right i can be ready by the time she wants me to meet them and make a good impression, what do you think?
[03/16/2006 12:03 PM] Me: anything to add?
[03/16/2006 12:03 PM] Melissa White: sounds like a good thing
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Melissa White: i would ask her if she is ready to introduce you to her parents
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Me: she is
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Melissa White: if she isn't surprising her with them might be bad
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Me: she already told them about me
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Melissa White: cool
[03/16/2006 12:04 PM] Me: i know, i can't wait to take her in my arms and tell her i am all hers
[03/16/2006 12:05 PM] Melissa White: well you must survive spring break first if amy is still coming out here
[03/16/2006 12:05 PM] Me: she told her parents about the situation with the other girl, she i will just be honest and careful if it comes up
[03/16/2006 12:05 PM] Me: i know i just can't stop thinking about Christina
[03/16/2006 12:05 PM] Me: i should ask her if shes tired, because shes been running through my mind all day
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Melissa White: you can't talk about christina with amy unless she asks and then she will probably cry anyway
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Me: i know
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Melissa White: when is christina leaving for spring break?
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Me: tomorrow mid day
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Melissa White: take her out for dinner tonight
[03/16/2006 12:06 PM] Me: and i cleaned her room, and she told her parents
[03/16/2006 12:07 PM] Me: she might have dinner plans but we are going to watch movies together tonight
[03/16/2006 12:07 PM] Melissa White: it will reassure her that things aren't going to change with amy over spring break
[03/16/2006 12:10 PM] Me: i understand
[03/16/2006 12:11 PM] Melissa White: just so long as you see her and do something with just her before she leaves is the most important
[03/16/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: and if it involves a bit of planning or thought on your part all the better
[03/16/2006 12:12 PM] Me: ok i see
[03/16/2006 12:12 PM] Melissa White: its just a way to show her you care
[03/16/2006 12:13 PM] Me: yes
[03/16/2006 12:13 PM] Me: maybe i should take her out
[03/16/2006 12:14 PM] Me: instead of just movies that i already have
[03/16/2006 12:14 PM] Me: but i don't have a car
[03/16/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: uuum
[03/16/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: maybe go get ice cream and then go back for movies
[03/16/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: the tcby is by hastings
[03/16/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: ask if she wants to rent a movie you might not have ( i know that's a stretch but hey had to suggest it )
[03/16/2006 12:18 PM] Me: yes well if i need a ride i now have one
[03/16/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: well there you go
[03/16/2006 12:19 PM] Me: yay
[03/16/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: and it doen'st have to be anything fancy
[03/16/2006 12:19 PM] Me: you're so good with giving advice
[03/16/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: just a hey your're on my mind i want to hang with you
[03/16/2006 12:20 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 12:20 PM] Melissa White: and if you are planning to go nicer after spring break, simple now may be best
[03/16/2006 12:20 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 12:20 PM] Melissa White: and then its more casual so that you can just relax and chat
[03/16/2006 12:25 PM] Me: busy today in the office?
[03/16/2006 12:25 PM] Melissa White: in spurts

[03/16/2006 06:29 PM] Melissa White: how's it going?
[03/16/2006 06:29 PM] Me: kind of strange how this all worked out with me and Amy
[03/16/2006 06:29 PM] Melissa White: ok
[03/16/2006 06:30 PM] Melissa White: what do you mean?
[03/16/2006 06:30 PM] Me: well its just she really expected me to be her last boyfriend
[03/16/2006 06:30 PM] Melissa White: wow
[03/16/2006 06:30 PM] Melissa White: did she say that?
[03/16/2006 06:30 PM] Me: and i'm just not ready for that kind of move, so instead of being friends she doesn't want me in her life at all
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Melissa White: that doesn't necsarrily surprise me
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Melissa White: she needs time to be ok with you taking a different role in her life
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Me: and i an asshole?
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Me: *am i
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Melissa White: did you follow your heart?
[03/16/2006 06:31 PM] Me: completely
[03/16/2006 06:32 PM] Melissa White: did you lead amy on?
[03/16/2006 06:32 PM] Melissa White: were you honest with amy?
[03/16/2006 06:32 PM] Me: when i met Christina something inside me just clicked and I knew i wasn't ready to wait for love when i am surrounded by it
[03/16/2006 06:33 PM] Melissa White: so... yes you did hurt amy, yes she will move on and figure out where her life is going
[03/16/2006 06:33 PM] Me: I told Amy i wanted to date this summer, i guess i did lead her on a little, i could have waited to make any commitment until this summer if i was still available, i guess i wasn't really into the relationship if i could be SO easily distracted by other girls
[03/16/2006 06:34 PM] Melissa White: if you had of not told her until she came out then i would say that you were an asshole but at least you realized that wasn't the best idea
[03/16/2006 06:34 PM] Melissa White: and when you told her that you wanted to date this summer,were you being honest
[03/16/2006 06:34 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 06:34 PM] Melissa White: if you were then you didn't really lead her on
[03/16/2006 06:34 PM] Melissa White: you are allowed to change you mind
[03/16/2006 06:35 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 06:35 PM] Me: well i g2g take my friend to get food, i have to hold her hand
[03/16/2006 06:35 PM] Melissa White: what if you had not gotten to know christina because you were waiting for amy and then she met some one in april?
[03/16/2006 06:35 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 06:35 PM] Me: i am thankful for such loving friends
[03/16/2006 06:36 PM] Melissa White: at this point you have set her free to find someone else
[03/16/2006 06:36 PM] Melissa White: instead of having her wait for you until this summer and then telling her that you didn't really want to date
[03/16/2006 06:37 PM] Me: yeah
[03/16/2006 06:37 PM] Me: well thanks again for your advice i really appreciate it
[03/16/2006 06:37 PM] Me: i g2g but leave me messages

[03/16/2006 09:19 PM] Me: i need you help
[03/16/2006 09:20 PM] Me: with the CS
[03/16/2006 09:20 PM] Melissa White: ok
[03/16/2006 09:20 PM] Melissa White: what's up?
[03/16/2006 09:24 PM] Me: ok so where do i loop through to find the best spot?
[03/16/2006 09:24 PM] Me: does the loop go in decide move or evaluate?
[03/16/2006 09:25 PM] Melissa White: in the decideMove
[03/16/2006 09:25 PM] Melissa White: i couldn't remember what it was callled
[03/16/2006 09:25 PM] Me: what goes in the evaluatepit?
[03/16/2006 09:26 PM] Melissa White: the scoring
[03/16/2006 09:26 PM] Me: does it only loop through row 0?
[03/16/2006 09:26 PM] Melissa White: what do you mean only through row 0?
[03/16/2006 09:27 PM] Me: like Call setPosI(), setPosJ(), and setRotation() every time to put the piece in a certain column on row 0. 
[03/16/2006 09:27 PM] Me: isn't that supposed to be through every row?
[03/16/2006 09:27 PM] Melissa White: go by column not row
[03/16/2006 09:28 PM] Me: i am so confused
[03/16/2006 09:29 PM] Me: where do we use drop and place?
[03/16/2006 09:29 PM] Melissa White: hang on let me pull up my code and look at it
[03/16/2006 09:31 PM] Melissa White: decideMove = setPosI,J,Rotation, drop, place, remove
[03/16/2006 09:31 PM] Melissa White: setDesiredMove = your scoring
[03/16/2006 09:32 PM] Me: setdesiredmove is coordinates though, the score is an integer
[03/16/2006 09:34 PM] Melissa White: i think you get it
[03/16/2006 09:35 PM] Melissa White: desiredmove saves a "best score" and the score interger controls the creation of that score
[03/16/2006 09:36 PM] Me: so desired move can be 1 integer?
[03/16/2006 09:36 PM] Me: and it automatically saves which one is best?
[03/16/2006 09:36 PM] Melissa White: you set up an if statement to save the best one
[03/16/2006 09:39 PM] Me: do i have to save the current coordinates it at too? or just the best score?
[03/16/2006 09:39 PM] Melissa White: yeah you want to store the column and rotation for the best score
[03/16/2006 09:39 PM] Me: ok
[03/16/2006 09:40 PM] Me: but i still don't understand why it only checks row zero
[03/16/2006 09:40 PM] Melissa White: you should set it to check from 0 to PITWIDTH - 1
[03/16/2006 09:41 PM] Melissa White: then it will check everything
[03/16/2006 09:42 PM] Me: then i have to check all 4 rotations too right?
[03/16/2006 09:43 PM] Melissa White: yup
[03/16/2006 09:44 PM] Melissa White: make sure you use the isValidPosition thing to check that it will actually go there
[03/16/2006 09:44 PM] Me: i did
[03/16/2006 09:45 PM] Melissa White: good good
[03/16/2006 09:58 PM] Melissa White: so hows it going?  did you get it playing tetris yet?
[03/16/2006 09:58 PM] Me: so how do i do the check in the evalpit?
[03/16/2006 09:59 PM] Melissa White: it looks very similar to the structure from decideMove
[03/16/2006 09:59 PM] Melissa White: i used a boolean to check for a full row and went from there with the logic of my scoring system
[03/16/2006 10:01 PM] Me: ok
[03/16/2006 10:04 PM] Me: did you use any loops in evaluatePit?
[03/16/2006 10:05 PM] Melissa White: yeah again 1 embedded into another
[03/16/2006 10:05 PM] Me: i hate this project
[03/16/2006 10:06 PM] Me: hes not descriptive at all!
[03/16/2006 10:06 PM] Me: i'm so confused
[03/16/2006 10:07 PM] Melissa White: he's never descriptive
[03/16/2006 10:07 PM] Melissa White: he needs to work on that

[03/17/2006 10:34 AM] Me: i hate that his program does some stuff for you
[03/17/2006 10:34 AM] Me: without any logic
[03/17/2006 10:35 AM] Me: it just put pieces there for you
[03/17/2006 10:38 AM] Me: like even in the first part when you place the block at 0, 1 is still automatically goes to 1 over instead of up against the side
[03/17/2006 10:38 AM] Me: did yours do that?

[03/17/2006 10:46 AM] Melissa White: use -1 instead of 0 thats what i had to do
[03/17/2006 10:46 AM] Me: i tried that and it didn't change
[03/17/2006 10:46 AM] Me: this program is retarded
[03/17/2006 10:46 AM] Melissa White: oh it did when i did ti
[03/17/2006 10:47 AM] Melissa White: um... did you take out 0,1 in the setMove thing from the first step of tesing it
[03/17/2006 10:47 AM] Me: yes of course
[03/17/2006 10:47 AM] Melissa White: um
[03/17/2006 10:47 AM] Me: and i replaced it with my variables
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Melissa White: then i'm not sure what its doing
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: i don't care about this stupid project anymore, i'm going to complain to him today
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Melissa White: what is your url?
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: (Link: http://www.cet.nau.edu/~bjc76/cs126/proj6)http://www.cet.nau.edu/~bjc76/cs126/proj6
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: /
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: add the slash at the end
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: this server sucks
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: its so freaking slow
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Melissa White: ok
[03/17/2006 10:48 AM] Me: even in the morning its slow
[03/17/2006 10:49 AM] Me: i am going to host it from mine from now on
[03/17/2006 10:49 AM] Melissa White: ok so use the -1 for the left edge and make it less bad to put a piece on the edge
[03/17/2006 10:49 AM] Me: like putty keeps pausing, so i would move down or over and have no idea where my cursor is until it jumps around
[03/17/2006 10:49 AM] Me: i am not changing its badness at all!
[03/17/2006 10:50 AM] Me: and its still doing that
[03/17/2006 10:50 AM] Melissa White: no you need to change the badness
[03/17/2006 10:50 AM] Me: for putting close to the edge?
[03/17/2006 10:50 AM] Melissa White: yeah
[03/17/2006 10:51 AM] Melissa White: make it less bad to put pieces on the edgwe
[03/17/2006 10:51 AM] Me: it doesn't make any sense, by default it should go to the edge, and the first 3 pieces should never be stacked, because it adds goodness if there is more empty rows which means their all closer to the bottom
[03/17/2006 10:51 AM] Me: and it keeps stacking them
[03/17/2006 10:51 AM] Me: it doesn't make any sense
[03/17/2006 10:52 AM] Me: god this server is retarted
[03/17/2006 10:52 AM] Melissa White: ok so your thing is a little psycho
[03/17/2006 10:53 AM] Melissa White: try making it more bad to have an empty tile below a full tile
[03/17/2006 10:54 AM] Me: and its like the server has some huge memory leak and gets exponentially slower with every compile?
[03/17/2006 10:54 AM] Melissa White: not really
[03/17/2006 10:54 AM] Melissa White: i haven't had problems with it on camput
[03/17/2006 10:55 AM] Melissa White: it is kind of slow for me from home but not here 
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Me: want coffee today?
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Melissa White: nah i'm good
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Me: hmmm
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Me: i might
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Melissa White: and you need to spend all the time you've got working on that project
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Me: no i'm leaving
[03/17/2006 11:01 AM] Me: stupid project

[03/17/2006 12:04 PM] Me: then how could you hate football
[03/17/2006 12:04 PM] Me: just watch it to look at the physically fit players
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Melissa White: they are not physically fit
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Melissa White: they are overly bulky
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Melissa White: and on way too many drugs
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Me: k
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Me: something about guys beating eachother up amuses me
[03/17/2006 12:05 PM] Me: eachother should be 1 word
[03/17/2006 12:07 PM] Melissa White: sometimes it should
[03/17/2006 12:08 PM] Melissa White: football isn't violent enough to amuse me
[03/17/2006 12:08 PM] Melissa White: i personally am a fan of hockey
[03/17/2006 12:10 PM] Me: yes hockey is wonderful
[03/17/2006 12:11 PM] Me: especially when the helmet comes off from being punshed and you get to see them bleed
[03/17/2006 12:11 PM] Melissa White: funny
[03/17/2006 12:11 PM] Melissa White: beyond hockey i'm not into mainstream sports

[03/17/2006 11:41 PM] Me: if i had already made arrangments
[03/17/2006 11:41 PM] Melissa White: it isn't over dramatizing, if its what she is feeling
[03/17/2006 11:42 PM] Me: sorry i wasn't ready for her to be "my last" girlfriend
[03/17/2006 11:42 PM] Melissa White: and i'm sure that she would rather have a fun spring break than one where she hangs out with you and feels like she isn't good enough
[03/17/2006 11:42 PM] Melissa White: thats fine but she needs time to work through those feelings
[03/17/2006 11:42 PM] Me: shes not
[03/17/2006 11:43 PM] Melissa White: i bet she'll have more fun anywhere but here
[03/17/2006 11:43 PM] Melissa White: even if it at school studying

[03/17/2006 11:43 PM] Me: all her friends are away at school
[03/17/2006 11:43 PM] Melissa White: then it is mutually beneficial

[03/17/2006 11:44 PM] Me: except for the plane ticket
[03/17/2006 11:44 PM] Me: no refund
[03/17/2006 11:44 PM] Melissa White: she can probably re book it later

[03/17/2006 11:47 PM] Melissa White: earrings are always good
[03/17/2006 11:48 PM] Melissa White: do you know that she likes opal and turquoise
[03/17/2006 11:48 PM] Me: from this place we have friends at in old town scottsdale
[03/17/2006 11:48 PM] Melissa White: do you know if she prefers bigger earrings or smaller
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Me: i see her with earings all the time
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Me: i think i'll make the right choice
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Me: once i see there selection
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Melissa White: unless you know for sure that she likes marquise or pear cuts stay away from them
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Melissa White: have you paid attention to what earrings she usually wears
[03/17/2006 11:49 PM] Melissa White: big/small
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Melissa White: stones/colors
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: medium
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: i'm thinking 2 links long
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: and turquise and opel are stones
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: well it would probably have to be simulated opel
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Melissa White: i know but does she wear stones?
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: she has some fake diamonds
[03/17/2006 11:50 PM] Me: not sure if she wears stones
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Me: thinking
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Me: simulated opel is always put in sterlin silver, and she does wear a lot of silver
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Melissa White: like if i got turquoise and opal earrings i wouldn't wear them at all
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Me: really?
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Melissa White: because i hate both of them
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Me: i know i'm thinking about her colors
[03/17/2006 11:51 PM] Me: she tans easily
[03/17/2006 11:52 PM] Me: she likes spring colors
[03/17/2006 11:52 PM] Me: and she wears them a lot
[03/17/2006 11:52 PM] Melissa White: i'm very particular to amethyst, diamond (blue), and garnet
[03/17/2006 11:52 PM] Melissa White: but if she lieks spring colors then those may be stones she likes
[03/17/2006 11:52 PM] Melissa White: and they do look good with a tan 
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Melissa White: i don't tan  for shit so i like the more cool colored stones
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Me: well how could you not like opel?
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Me: its all different light colors
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Melissa White: opals are icky
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Melissa White: i hate their funny milky color
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Me: ok i'm thinking now, no turqoise, just opel
[03/17/2006 11:53 PM] Melissa White: ick!!
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: have you seen simulated opel?
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Melissa White: yeah
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: it is a lot brighter
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Melissa White: not my fave
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: ok
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Melissa White: but if you think that she would like it...
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: i think they would look good on her
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Melissa White: just be fairly sure
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: i mentioned it
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: she said she likes opel
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: after i explained what it was
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: lol
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Me: what a nerd
[03/17/2006 11:54 PM] Melissa White: because nothing sucks more than being the recipient of jewlery that you don't like and asking to have it exchanged
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Me: lol
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Me: yeah
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Melissa White: an idea...
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Me: maybe i should just bring her here and have her pick it out
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Melissa White: go wander through the shops down there or a general jewlery display in the mall and watch what she looks at and likes
[03/17/2006 11:55 PM] Me: gosh maybe i should wait until after we go to a jewelery shop just to look
[03/17/2006 11:56 PM] Melissa White: that way you don't have to give away the surprise but you can see her reaction to different things
[03/17/2006 11:56 PM] Me: yeah
[03/17/2006 11:57 PM] Me: gosh not much time before her b-day and she lives in sedona
[03/17/2006 11:57 PM] Melissa White: you could even point out something similar to what you are thinking and say something like "oh remember we were talking about opals... this is what i was telling you about"
[03/17/2006 11:57 PM] Me: oOo you are a smartie

[03/27/2006 12:15 PM] Melissa White: well i'm glad he doesn't hate me makes me feel better
[03/27/2006 12:15 PM] Melissa White: i think he pretty much hates Laurel and Eric though
[03/27/2006 12:16 PM] Melissa White: because they were kind of rude to him when i was listening in on thier calls
[03/27/2006 12:16 PM] Me: yeah he said you were cool on the phone but Laurel was kind of mean, and i explained they were just doing their job, he let it go

[03/27/2006 12:16 PM] Me: yeah well they had good reason, they have to be defensive to offenders

[03/27/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: they were rude to him for no reason
[03/27/2006 12:17 PM] Melissa White: they could have handled the situation better
[03/27/2006 12:18 PM] Me: yeah maybe, i guess its just hard when ITS talks to them and they have to deal with it
[03/27/2006 12:18 PM] Melissa White: honestly i kind of felt bad for him
[03/27/2006 12:18 PM] Me: and i told him we're not the ones that block people we just deal with it
[03/27/2006 12:18 PM] Melissa White: ITS doesn't talk to us
[03/27/2006 12:18 PM] Melissa White: we get an email from the server

[04/05/2006 12:18 PM] Melissa White: have you fucked up already?
[04/05/2006 12:18 PM] Me: do i need to work out so i become more sexually attractive for her?
[04/05/2006 12:18 PM] Melissa White: funny
[04/05/2006 12:18 PM] Me: she mentioned me being out of shape, would it improve our relationship if i work out, or does she just not find my physically attractive?
[04/05/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: it could be either of those
[04/05/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: working out won't kill you
[04/05/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: might balance some of your programming time
[04/05/2006 12:19 PM] Me: hmmm, it might, i am a computer nerd, i thrive on laziness
[04/05/2006 12:19 PM] Melissa White: but do it for you not her or you will resent her for it
[04/05/2006 12:20 PM] Me: yes i understand, thank you
[04/05/2006 12:20 PM] Melissa White: is she saying this because she wants you to go workout or go hiking or something like that with her?
[04/05/2006 12:20 PM] Me: but i do want to be more physically attractive to her, so i guess i'd be doing it for both of us
[04/05/2006 12:21 PM] Me: well we do want to go hiking together, i am not quite sure what she wants, she just said i was "small", and i suggested that i buff up a little, and she liked that idea
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Melissa White: i see
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Me: but i am still bigger then her, that's what matters to me
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Melissa White: height isn't everything
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Me: of course this is all just physical, our relationship is strong and extends far past the physical aspect
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Melissa White: she probably wants to feel safe with you
[04/05/2006 12:22 PM] Melissa White: don't under estimate the physical aspect
[04/05/2006 12:23 PM] Me: i know

[04/14/2006 10:58 AM] Melissa White: but there is nothing that can really be done about it because of the way that it is managed
[04/14/2006 10:58 AM] Melissa White: and you getting upset about it isn't worth it
[04/14/2006 10:58 AM] Melissa White: and when you perpetuate "not a university"
[04/14/2006 10:58 AM] Melissa White: you devalue all of our degrees and experiences here
[04/14/2006 11:00 AM] Melissa White: and i as much as anyone have issues with the way that nau does business
[04/14/2006 11:00 AM] Melissa White: but honestly it is a highly respected school
[04/14/2006 11:01 AM] Melissa White: maybe not a medical or research school but stil a good school
[04/14/2006 11:01 AM] Me: yeah
[04/14/2006 11:01 AM] Me: but there are little things that could be done to make it a lot better
[04/14/2006 11:02 AM] Me: and that's what annoys me the most is when no one takes actions to fix these little things to drastically improve the big picture
[04/14/2006 11:02 AM] Melissa White: yeah there are
[04/14/2006 11:02 AM] Melissa White: that's why i work here
