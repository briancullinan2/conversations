[11/29/2005 09:47 AM] Me: This webpage is designed so that I will hopefully pass English 105. I believe no student would make such a site out of their own free will. In this website you will find a bunch of nonsensical information about my essays I had to do for the course and how it helped me become a better learner. You will see excerpts from each of my six essays and a reflection about each excerpt. You will be enlightened by finding in my writings about how I advanced as a critical thinker, reader, and writer. You will see how I became literate in the world of technology and how incorporating a computer lab once a week helped me succeed.
