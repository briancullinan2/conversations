[02/19/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: that focuses on nothing but athletics
[02/19/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: no computer department
[02/19/2005 11:31 PM] Kristina: i mean our marching went to pits this year becasue of a new band director two years ago but were slowly getting the hang of him
[02/19/2005 11:31 PM] BrianJCullinan: no fine arts department
[02/19/2005 11:31 PM] Kristina: well  i understand that, the supreme court of AZ wants to abolish music in elementary school
[02/19/2005 11:32 PM] BrianJCullinan: why would they do that?
[02/19/2005 11:32 PM] Kristina: music is expensive
[02/19/2005 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: but worth it
[02/19/2005 11:34 PM] Kristina: definatley but they dont see any profit in it so they choose to eliminate it 
[02/19/2005 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: and there is profit in sports?
[02/19/2005 11:34 PM] BrianJCullinan: lol
[02/19/2005 11:35 PM] Kristina: more people do sports than music
[02/19/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: so 5 out of every 1000 students that participate in sports make it big, big deal, you might as well just flush money down the toilet instead of spending it on equipment
[02/19/2005 11:35 PM] BrianJCullinan: but every musician benefits
[02/19/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: they are taught discipline
[02/19/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: and routine
[02/19/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: and creativity
[02/19/2005 11:36 PM] BrianJCullinan: all at the same time
[02/19/2005 11:36 PM] Kristina: you try telling that to them, they'll prolly say something along the lines of ,"Teamwork, health, and discipline" 
[02/19/2005 11:37 PM] Kristina: I think they think that music is a sit down thing so that people dont get fit from doing it
[02/19/2005 11:37 PM] BrianJCullinan: hmmm

[06/17/2005 04:44 PM] Me: hey do you play Guild Wars?
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: nah
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Kristina: maybe
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: maybe?
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Kristina: im looking up into it
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Kristina: i also wanna try city of heroes
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: you should get Guild Wars
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: its awesome
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: no monthly fee

[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Kristina: are there different servers?
[06/17/2005 04:45 PM] Me: yeah
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: which one are you on?
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Me: but its easy to navigate through them
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Me: the America server
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Me: then within that there are different server
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Me: but you can switch
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: oh...thats waht i meant
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: i know
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: ive played world of warcraft before
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: and ffXI
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Kristina: hows the money system in the game BTW?
[06/17/2005 04:46 PM] Me: whenever you are in a city, you can see the other people, then all you have to do is choose which "District" you want
[06/17/2005 04:47 PM] Me: its gold
[06/17/2005 04:47 PM] Me: and you get it from battles and selling items
[06/17/2005 04:47 PM] Kristina: is it moderate, easy or hard to get money and are the auction houses reasonable?
[06/17/2005 04:47 PM] Me: yeah its pretty easy
[06/17/2005 04:47 PM] Me: but its also easy to spend
[06/17/2005 04:48 PM] Kristina: this was the problem from final fantasy. money was bitchin hard to get and the japanese screwed the americans rom getting good items by makingridiculous amounts to pay for the stuff on the auctions
[06/17/2005 04:48 PM] Me: lol
[06/17/2005 04:48 PM] Me: no its not like that at all
[06/17/2005 04:48 PM] Kristina: for world of warcraft...well...the game was just too easy to play
[06/17/2005 04:48 PM] Kristina: i wanna try city of heroes and then, ya know, play guild wars as well
[06/17/2005 04:49 PM] Me: like if i spend all my money on new armor, it would take me a day to earn that money back
[06/17/2005 04:49 PM] Me: what is city of heros?
[06/17/2005 04:49 PM] Kristina: thats pretty wuick
[06/17/2005 04:49 PM] Kristina: city of heroes is a MMORPG and you get to play a superhero
[06/17/2005 04:49 PM] Kristina: (Link: http://www.cityofheroes.com)www.cityofheroes.com
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Kristina: it came out last year 
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Me: cool
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Me: i like guild wars
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Kristina: city of villains is stand alone and my sis wants to play that, heh
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Kristina: maybe ill try both
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Kristina: how are the character creatioins?
[06/17/2005 04:50 PM] Me: its awesome
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Me: you can customize your type like in FFXI
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Me: then you choose what you look like
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Kristina: what profession are you and what race(or whatever)
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Me: and you start off with beginning armor, then along the way find more
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Me: yeah its preffesions more or less
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Kristina: im at the website chekcin it out some more
[06/17/2005 04:51 PM] Kristina: how much did it cost btw
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Me: i am a male elementalist
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Me: its $50
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Me: but you can have more then one character
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Me: i just created a female archer
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Kristina: are there different elementalists like fire or just water or whatever?
[06/17/2005 04:52 PM] Me: then along the way you get a secondary proffesion, and i am a monk
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Me: it all depends on the skills you learn along the way
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Kristina: ah
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Me: you can switch out your skills
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Kristina: i like the melee types
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Kristina: archer you say? what else?
[06/17/2005 04:53 PM] Me: so if you wanted to have all fire attacks then you could switch them out and raise your ability of Fire Magic
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Me: you're at the website right?
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Kristina: yeah
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Kristina: are you PvP or roleplay?
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Kristina: im lookin at the website manuel for the game
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Me: roleplay
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Me: roleplay can do both
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Kristina: yup!
[06/17/2005 04:54 PM] Me: so you can eventually get to the pvp
[06/17/2005 04:55 PM] Me: (Link: http://guildwars.com/gameinfo/professions/default.html)http://guildwars.com/gameinfo/professions/default.html
[06/17/2005 04:55 PM] Kristina: nah im at it right now
[06/17/2005 04:55 PM] Kristina: hey brb, phone
[06/17/2005 04:55 PM] Me: well that's not all the proffesions
[06/17/2005 04:55 PM] *** Auto-response from Kristina: If people were powered by chlorophyll, and you were stuck in the desert, 
 you'd have to run around screaming just to keep from being overfed.
[06/17/2005 04:56 PM] Me: this is the full list of skills you can learn (Link: http://guildwars.gameamp.com/guildwars/skill)http://guildwars.gameamp.com/guildwars/skill
[06/17/2005 04:56 PM] Me: click the profession at the top
[06/17/2005 04:57 PM] Me: oh yeah, one thing i don't like is the max level is 20
[06/17/2005 04:57 PM] Me: but it takes a long time to level up
[06/17/2005 04:58 PM] Me: and the map of places you can go is unbelievably huge
[06/17/2005 05:03 PM] Kristina: what about fighting monsters or whatever
[06/17/2005 05:04 PM] Me: you use the skills in the bottom bar, those are the extra attacks, but the character operates the weapon they have
[06/17/2005 05:04 PM] Me: some weapons require certain abilities
[06/17/2005 05:04 PM] Me: like a fire staff might require 4 fire magic
[06/17/2005 05:04 PM] Kristina: well yeah but i mean, how hard is it to fight a monster thats one or two levels above you?
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Me: not very
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Me: most of the stuff is done with other people
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Me: like quests or missions
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Kristina: well yeah
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Kristina: its like WoW
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Me: missions are included in certain cities to continue in the game
[06/17/2005 05:05 PM] Me: so you can easily form a group of people to help fight certain monsters
[06/17/2005 05:06 PM] Me: and most of the monsters will attack you, but sometimes they don't attack
[06/17/2005 05:06 PM] Me: sometimes they attack in groups, that's why you would need a group to help you
[06/17/2005 05:06 PM] Kristina: yeah ive been through that before
[06/17/2005 05:06 PM] Me: and you can easily join someone else fighting a monster
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Kristina: benn there too
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Me: its fun
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Kristina: : ) maybe ill tyr it out
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Me: but like i said, you only see other people in the city, unless you are teamed up with them
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Kristina: i do have a fifty i got for graduation that i havnt spent yet
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Me: good idea
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Kristina: what is the downside for you?
[06/17/2005 05:07 PM] Me: its a lot of fun
[06/17/2005 05:08 PM] Me: umm you can only have one account
[06/17/2005 05:08 PM] Kristina: well thats fine
[06/17/2005 05:08 PM] Me: you can't have two people playing on the same account at the same time
[06/17/2005 05:08 PM] Kristina: tahts fine too
[06/17/2005 05:08 PM] Me: guild capes cost a lot and i can't think of a name for a guild, guild registration only cost 100g and that's easy to get
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Kristina: want a catchy name for a guild eh?
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Me: another downside is its addicting, i can play for 12 hours and never get bored
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Kristina: Lol
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Kristina: Well, i can go out and get it today right now, or wait until tomorrow
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Me: ummm if you don't have other people to play with, you can use the computer
[06/17/2005 05:09 PM] Me: and there is reasonable computer activity
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: the "bots" are fun
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: easy to get along with, pretty smart too
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Kristina: as in the cheating kind?
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Kristina: or NPC's
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: no
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: the kind built into the game
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: NPC?
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Kristina: those are NPC's
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Kristina: Non PLaying Character
[06/17/2005 05:10 PM] Me: you can download the game
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Kristina: but i thought you had to buy it?
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: register online for a key then download the game
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Kristina: really? you serious?
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: there is a setup that downloads it for you
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Kristina: so like i can start now?
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: yeah
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Kristina: SWEET!
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Kristina: how long did it take you to DL?
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: and all the different areas update automatically when you play them
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: i torrented the ISOs that's not legal
[06/17/2005 05:11 PM] Me: but the setup works too
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Me: probably better
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Kristina: you didnt pay for it?
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Kristina: what are ISO's
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Me: CD images
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Me: you just pay for the Key
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Me: if i bought the game it would come with a key
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Me: i had to buy the key online
[06/17/2005 05:12 PM] Kristina: you torrented cd images? just t look at? 
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: yeah
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: but then i had to register online
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Kristina: what s so illegal?
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: so i became a paying customer
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: so its not illegal
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: because i paid for it
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Kristina: um okay
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Kristina: well they do have screenshots
[06/17/2005 05:13 PM] Me: but (Link: http://www.plaync.com/)(Link: http://www.plaync.com/)http://www.plaync.com/ offers a setup that downloads the files for you
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Me: and that's legal, that is where you register your key
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Kristina: URL not found
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.plaync.com/)http://www.plaync.com/(Link: http://www.plaync.com/)
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Me: works for me
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Kristina: where do i DL the game?
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Me: you get the setup file after you register for a key
[06/17/2005 05:14 PM] Me: then the setup downloads the game
[06/17/2005 05:15 PM] Kristina: ok
[06/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: so you have to get the key, then they will send you and e-mail to download the setup
[06/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: then when you get into the game it will ask for the key
[06/17/2005 05:15 PM] Kristina: i gotta make an account? bummer, i hate that 
[06/17/2005 05:15 PM] Me: yeah

 A Caldera is the rim of a Volcano like a Crater, only a Caldera is a Crater inside and crater.  If This were to Erupt, it would give devastating effects Six Thousand Times worse than Mt. Saint Helens and Pinatubo.  
  
 Mt. Saint Helen's Crater was only 0.6 miles in diameter. In Yellowstone it is a 10 mile scale. Even then, the Caldera is about 25 miles wide and 50 miles long.  
  
 The ash of St. Helens spread near central Colorado in about 16 hours. The Caldera Ash would spread across 3/4 of America in a couple of days.
