[08/10/2005 09:06 PM] Me: when it reads it is rumbling it didn't do that before
[08/10/2005 09:06 PM] Me: i used it on the airplane and in the car, maybe i ruined it
[08/10/2005 09:07 PM] Dan F: shouldnt have done anything, but if it stops its under warrenty still
[08/10/2005 09:08 PM] Me: if i were to connect my computer to the receiver will all the different signals be passed through the 1 analog to be processed by the reciever?
[08/10/2005 09:09 PM] Dan F: thats a really good question see if you can research that, i think so
[08/10/2005 09:09 PM] Me: yeah i'm pretty sure it would
[08/10/2005 09:09 PM] Dan F: i believe so
[08/10/2005 09:11 PM] Me: damnit andrew never responds'
[08/10/2005 09:11 PM] Me: he is always busy rebuilding some server
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] Me: how easy is it to tie up L and R wires into composite?
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] Dan F: ?
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Dan F: composite is red and white
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Dan F: which is left and right
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Me: i mean the bar shit
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Me: the red and black
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Me: *bare
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Me: no ends, just wires
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Me: with the little clips
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Dan F: you mean speaker wire?
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Me: yeah
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Me: ...
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Me: speaker wire
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Dan F: the recieve will do that
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Me: yeah but i mean if i don't use the receiver
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Me: i got it
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Dan F: and there in lies the problem, the reciever is needed to amplify the signal
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Me: i need to use the optical or coaxial outputs from my sound card
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Dan F: can you?
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Dan F: how will you pull that off
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Me: i plug it in
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Dan F: lol i dont follow 
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Me: ok i'm switching topics
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Me: we are back to using the reveiver
[08/10/2005 09:25 PM] Dan F: ok
[08/10/2005 09:25 PM] Me: i plug the coaxial or optical output from my soundcard on my motherboard into the receiver
[08/10/2005 09:26 PM] Me: that's how i get the surround sound signals to be processed by the reveicer
[08/10/2005 09:26 PM] Dan F: ok thats much better than a line signal
[08/10/2005 09:26 PM] Me: because if i just used the regular speaker output then only the left, right, center signals are sent
[08/10/2005 09:27 PM] Dan F: ok

[08/10/2005 09:29 PM] Me: but i don't know if that is for audio
[08/10/2005 09:29 PM] Me: i feel so nubish
[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Dan F: to my knowledge thoes are both video
[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Me: spdif?

[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Dan F: 
  ?
[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Me: so how can it be?
[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Dan F: i dont know
[08/10/2005 09:30 PM] Me: it must be ausio
[08/10/2005 09:31 PM] Me: *audio
[08/10/2005 09:31 PM] Dan F: i dunno

[08/10/2005 09:32 PM] Me: they list it in the audio group on that page
[08/10/2005 09:32 PM] Dan F: ok but does that output a full signal?
[08/10/2005 09:33 PM] Dan F: thats what you need to find out
[08/10/2005 09:33 PM] Me: why wouldn't it be
[08/10/2005 09:33 PM] Me: that's what they are used for
[08/10/2005 09:33 PM] Me: because the modules are so much for complex they push all the signals on them
[08/10/2005 09:34 PM] Dan F: maybe it does then
[08/10/2005 09:34 PM] Me: do receivers have optical or coaxial input though?
[08/10/2005 09:35 PM] Dan F: most will

[08/13/2005 04:54 PM] Dan F: id say so, as much as i want to work on it, we cant when none of us are together

[08/13/2005 05:02 PM] Me: what are you and greg doing?
[08/13/2005 05:02 PM] Dan F: same thing minus all the tvs and monitors
[08/13/2005 05:02 PM] Me: oh
[08/13/2005 05:02 PM] Me: yeah but you have the hard drive
[08/13/2005 05:02 PM] Me: did the firewire work?
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Me: did you install it? because i wouldn't expect the firewire to be plug and play like the usb
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Dan F: i figured it out, that hard drive needs 1394a
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Dan F: the "a" makes all the difference apparently
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Me: and?
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Me: wtf?
[08/13/2005 05:03 PM] Dan F: mine isnt a
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Me: that sucks
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Me: i wonder what mine is
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Dan F: but i bought a firewire pcmcia card
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Dan F: and that did the trick
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Me: and hows the speed?
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Dan F: its good, its only noticable when transfering a ton of crap and its faster than usb
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Dan F: still have to wait tho
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Dan F: but it is faster
[08/13/2005 05:04 PM] Me: yeah cool cool
[08/13/2005 05:05 PM] Me: it would be really sick in the new seagates supported external SATA
[08/13/2005 05:05 PM] Me: and usb
[08/13/2005 05:05 PM] Me: i don't know what version firewire i have
[08/13/2005 05:05 PM] Me: but its probably going to be different then the firewire 800 on the new seagates
[08/13/2005 05:05 PM] Dan F: 800 is the top of the line ieee
[08/13/2005 05:06 PM] Dan F: id bet money your laptop cant use 800
[08/13/2005 05:06 PM] Dan F: im not sure any can
[08/13/2005 05:07 PM] Me: i might be able to use it on my desktop
[08/13/2005 05:07 PM] Me: i don't know what my desktop supports though
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Me: lets find out
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Dan F: yeah you might, if not then you can get another pci firewire card to do 800
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Dan F: thats easier 
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Me: nice to see that my socket 939 is still the top asus board
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Dan F: yeah thatd suck if another one just came out
[08/13/2005 05:08 PM] Me: yeah
[08/13/2005 05:10 PM] Me: it says here that is it 1394a
[08/13/2005 05:10 PM] Dan F: ur laptop?
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Dan F: 1394a i believe is firewire 400
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Me: no my computer at home
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Me: yeah 400 sucks
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Dan F: oh ok
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Me: i don't want to have to buy a pci card
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Me: i don't have any open slots
[08/13/2005 05:11 PM] Dan F: well then ur boned
[08/13/2005 05:12 PM] Me: they are filled up with onboard connectors

[08/13/2005 05:12 PM] Me: *4 onboard

[08/13/2005 05:13 PM] Dan F: there no way your gunna have 10 usb decices plugged in at the same time

[08/13/2005 05:15 PM] Me: some kind of gaming/midi connector
[08/13/2005 05:16 PM] Me: and the firewire has 2 usb with it
[08/13/2005 05:16 PM] Me: i can't remember but there isn't enough room

[08/16/2005 07:40 PM] Dan F: oh i wanted to ask you
[08/16/2005 07:41 PM] Dan F: you know of a good way to convert composite video to vga?
[08/16/2005 07:41 PM] Me: i know you can convert composite to coaxial easily
[08/16/2005 07:41 PM] Me: but VGA is going to get tricky
[08/16/2005 07:42 PM] Dan F: yeah i cant find anthing cheap
[08/16/2005 07:42 PM] Me: hmmm
[08/16/2005 07:47 PM] Dan F: do you remember that one thing at frys we saw, i dont remember what it was called, it had its own little display thing, it was like a switch for a bunch of devices
[08/16/2005 07:48 PM] Dan F: i can see it in my mind, i just cant figure out waht it was, but i think that thing could do it
[08/16/2005 07:48 PM] Dan F: and then some
[08/16/2005 07:48 PM] Me: yeah i remember it
[08/16/2005 07:48 PM] Me: it wasn't a converter though
[08/16/2005 07:48 PM] Me: just what exactly are you trying to do?
[08/16/2005 07:50 PM] Dan F: for next year, we are gunna use gregs monitor for our tv, and we wanna use the ps2, or anything else
[08/16/2005 07:50 PM] Dan F: so we can switch between inputs
[08/16/2005 07:50 PM] Me: oh
[08/16/2005 07:50 PM] Me: hmmm
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Dan F: would frys carry a switching device like that, 
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Me: you might be able to do it with that switch as long as it has composite input and vga out
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Dan F: yeah the vga output is what i cant find
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Dan F: thats the only problem
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Me: i thought it old had vga inputs and vga output
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Dan F: ?
[08/16/2005 07:51 PM] Me: well it had a VGA output but not in i don't think

[08/16/2005 07:52 PM] Me: sry
[08/16/2005 07:52 PM] Me: the switch we were looking at didn't convert at all
[08/16/2005 07:52 PM] Me: it just had VGA out and lots of VGA inputs
[08/16/2005 07:53 PM] Dan F: dude i remember that thing could hook up lots of other devices, it had a ps2 picture on it
[08/16/2005 07:53 PM] Me: really?
[08/16/2005 07:54 PM] Me: then go get yourself one
[08/16/2005 07:54 PM] Dan F: yeah there were two different products, one was a computer switch
[08/16/2005 07:54 PM] Dan F: but id swear the other could do more

[09/25/2005 01:02 PM] Me: so impersonal
[09/25/2005 01:03 PM] Dan F: hmmm
[09/25/2005 01:03 PM] Me: but i think i could consider her an option
[09/25/2005 01:03 PM] Me: i have a few options but all of them are waiting for me to either step it up a notch or just back off
[09/25/2005 01:03 PM] Me: so i need creative ideas

[09/25/2005 01:05 PM] Me: and if i got chelsea something for her car for her birthday, that might work, along with coming to see her in tempe and bring oreos and peanut butter might turn things really kinky, and my last option would pretty much give in at any time
[09/25/2005 01:05 PM] Me: but i care about all three a lot
[09/25/2005 01:05 PM] Me: they are all really awesome people
[09/25/2005 01:05 PM] Me: so keep going at it with that girl

[09/25/2005 01:07 PM] Me: Andrea, i am talking to now, shes like the nicest person i know, shes so sweet, but she might be to quiet and calm for me, and jessie, she is pretty cool and really nice, she keeps playing the game though shes a lot of fun but i don't think she would give in
[09/25/2005 01:08 PM] Me: yeah dude do dinner and if possible do off campus
[09/25/2005 01:08 PM] Me: but its the environment that matters most
[09/25/2005 01:08 PM] Me: make her feel comfortable and throw out a few compliments during the night
[09/25/2005 01:09 PM] Dan F: ok thats good advice, but its too bad neither of us have a car here
[09/25/2005 01:10 PM] Dan F: who is the other girl?
[09/25/2005 01:10 PM] Me: yeah off campus is pretty close in flag because campus is long and skinny and on the sides is all the restaurants "off campus"
[09/25/2005 01:10 PM] Me: jessie and andrea and chelsea might all be options
[09/25/2005 01:11 PM] Dan F: oh ok hmmm

[10/03/2005 09:07 AM] Me: she is so not out of my league, there is definitely a possibility that the oreos and peanut butter she told me to bring next time might work for her

[10/03/2005 09:08 AM] Me: well i could do what every person does whether they admit it or not

[10/06/2005 09:16 AM] Me: i get it
[10/06/2005 09:16 AM] Me: that's fucking amazing
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Dan F: haha yeah it took me a second too
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Me: i was thinking about making shirts that display theories or computer methods with little stick figures
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Dan F: i love it so much
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Dan F: how so?
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Me: so far i want to do The McDonalds Method and The Wendy's Method
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Me: and The push and pull methods
[10/06/2005 09:17 AM] Me: 2 different shirts
[10/06/2005 09:18 AM] Me: and i was thinking make hard drive sizes and the number of sectors
[10/06/2005 09:18 AM] Me: like
 bit
 byte
 kilobyte
 megabyte
 gigabyte
 tarabyte
[10/06/2005 09:18 AM] Dan F: and the fast food one?
[10/06/2005 09:18 AM] Me: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:19 AM] Me: ....
[10/06/2005 09:19 AM] Me: chip logic
[10/06/2005 09:19 AM] Me: you'll understand when you are older
[10/06/2005 09:19 AM] Me: j/k i'll tell you
[10/06/2005 09:19 AM] Dan F: damn right im older than you are
[10/06/2005 09:20 AM] Me: the mcdonalds method, all the people/commands are in separate lines moving up when the next cashier/cpu is ready
[10/06/2005 09:20 AM] Dan F: that could be funny
[10/06/2005 09:20 AM] Me: the wendy's method, all people/commands are in 1 single line moving to the specific cashier/cpu when its ready
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Dan F: sounds like how bandwidth works
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Me: that can be applied to all kinds of computer logic, 1 core as opposed to dual core, SATA as apposed to IDE
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Dan F: wow dude
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Dan F: lol
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Me: you know the push and pull methods right?  you made a server
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Dan F: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Me: those are just the most obvious applications
[10/06/2005 09:21 AM] Dan F: sure
[10/06/2005 09:22 AM] Me: so for the mcwendys methods i was thinking just having people lined up infront of stick figure cashiers but with computer chip looking heads
[10/06/2005 09:22 AM] Dan F: thats hot
[10/06/2005 09:23 AM] Me: and for the push and pull i was thinking of having just a short dialog between two stick figures seperated by a wall or hallway
[10/06/2005 09:23 AM] Me: but now i need to figure out how to print the white ink
[10/06/2005 09:24 AM] Me: because i want it on black shirts
[10/06/2005 09:24 AM] Dan F: thats gunna be much harder
[10/06/2005 09:24 AM] Me: maybe if i suggest them to think geek they will do it for me and send me one for free
[10/06/2005 09:24 AM] Dan F: if its a they like the idea yeah
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: ooooo
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: i got another great idea to add to the people in the lines
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: i will make them wearing a shirt and put commands on them
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Dan F: haha
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: like JMP, MOV,
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: all those
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: but are those the operating system commands?
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Dan F: id do asm registers
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:25 AM] Me: ,,,,
[10/06/2005 09:26 AM] Me: asm?
[10/06/2005 09:26 AM] Dan F: assembly
[10/06/2005 09:26 AM] Me: yeah what registers?
[10/06/2005 09:27 AM] Dan F: like have the guy at the front of the line .STACK, and the last guy END, and everyone in the middle, like mov ah, 01, behind him, mov ah 02 ect
[10/06/2005 09:27 AM] Dan F: you see?
[10/06/2005 09:29 AM] Me: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:29 AM] Dan F: just an idea
[10/06/2005 09:29 AM] Me: it might work
[10/06/2005 09:29 AM] Dan F: something
[10/06/2005 09:30 AM] Me: now for the hard drive one i have to learn sectors and why we say 1000 kilobytes is a megabyte when infact its 1024
[10/06/2005 09:30 AM] Me: and how that plays a role in the higher numbers like gigabytes
[10/06/2005 09:30 AM] Me: what is the exact gigabyte
[10/06/2005 09:30 AM] Dan F: 1024 megs
[10/06/2005 09:31 AM] Me: so would it be 1,024,000 kilos?
[10/06/2005 09:31 AM] Me: so would it be 1,024,000,000 bytes?
[10/06/2005 09:31 AM] Me: or is it 1,000,000,024?
[10/06/2005 09:31 AM] Dan F: no
[10/06/2005 09:32 AM] Dan F: i think you were right the first time
[10/06/2005 09:32 AM] Me: ok
[10/06/2005 09:33 AM] Dan F: we were all wrong 1 gig is 1024 megs is 1048600 kilo, is 1073700000 bytes
[10/06/2005 09:33 AM] Dan F: (Link: http://www.speedguide.net/conversion.php)http://www.speedguide.net/conversion.php
[10/06/2005 09:34 AM] Me: shit how did you find that?
[10/06/2005 09:34 AM] Dan F: google
[10/06/2005 09:35 AM] Me: that's fucking hot
[10/06/2005 09:35 AM] Dan F: :-P
[10/06/2005 09:35 AM] Me: i want to make the shirt the number of bytes
[10/06/2005 09:36 AM] Dan F: do it
[10/06/2005 09:37 AM] Me: so
 1 byte
 1024 = 1 kilobytes
 1048600 = 1 megabytes
 1073700000 = 1 gigabyte
[10/06/2005 09:37 AM] Dan F: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:37 AM] Me: before that 8 bits = 1 byte
[10/06/2005 09:37 AM] Dan F: yeah
[10/06/2005 09:37 AM] Dan F: and 4 bits = nibble
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Dan F: which is irelevant
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: 1099500000000 = 1 terabyte
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Dan F: sure
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: oOo
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: RGB vs CMYK
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: that could be fun
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Dan F: CMYK always
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: yes
[10/06/2005 09:38 AM] Me: more colors in theory
[10/06/2005 09:39 AM] Me: i have to go to english

[10/24/2005 09:45 AM] Dan Fairaizl: hmmmm
[10/24/2005 09:46 AM] Me: like if there was hex values on a file 0000000000 it would be something like 0x10
[10/24/2005 09:46 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok
[10/24/2005 09:46 AM] Me: that's regular compression, there are more advanced compressions where all the repeated values are converted to a single value and a number
[10/24/2005 09:47 AM] Dan Fairaizl: that sounds like fun
[10/24/2005 09:47 AM] Me: its actually really easy to do zeros, i've seen it done in PHP
[10/24/2005 09:47 AM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah it doesnt seem that hard
[10/24/2005 09:47 AM] Me: i g2g to class though
[10/24/2005 09:47 AM] Me: ttyl
[10/24/2005 09:48 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool man cya
[10/24/2005 10:57 AM] Me: back
[10/24/2005 10:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: score

[10/24/2005 10:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: its pretty sexy
[10/24/2005 10:57 AM] Me: i can send you that code for the compression if you like
[10/24/2005 10:57 AM] Dan Fairaizl: sure i want to take a look
[10/24/2005 10:58 AM] Me: uhhh it might take me a little bit to find it
[10/24/2005 10:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[10/24/2005 10:58 AM] Me: where is there a picture of this tv?
[10/24/2005 10:58 AM] Dan Fairaizl: ...

[10/24/2005 11:00 AM] Me: she broke up with her boyfriend
[10/24/2005 11:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: she had a boyfriend?
[10/24/2005 11:00 AM] Dan Fairaizl: who?
[10/24/2005 11:00 AM] Me: yeah some guy from PV
[10/24/2005 11:01 AM] Me: so i might see her this weekend

[10/24/2005 11:01 AM] Me: i really want to have sex with her but i'm not counting on it
[10/24/2005 11:01 AM] Dan Fairaizl: haha yeah man
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Me: yeah i can't find that code
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: no worries
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Me: but it won't be to hard to find an example
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Me: just google PHP Compression or Archiver
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: nah
[10/24/2005 11:03 AM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[10/24/2005 11:04 AM] Me: i'm sure you could port it to C++ if you really wanted to
[10/24/2005 11:04 AM] Me: ooo this might be it
[10/24/2005 11:04 AM] Dan Fairaizl: probably but i dont wanna try it in C
[10/24/2005 11:05 AM] Me: ahhh here it is
[10/24/2005 11:05 AM] Me: i g2g to class in a minute

[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and pitch black
[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Me: what is pitch black?
[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the first movie
[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Dan Fairaizl: the prequil
[11/13/2005 06:24 PM] Me: the first movie?
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: lets make a game
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: multiplayer
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: choose your racew
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: each has different strengths
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: use the quake 4 graphics
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sounds like lots of other games
[11/13/2005 06:25 PM] Me: buts its a first person shooter with the ability to choose a race
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Me: not a strategy game
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Me: and not like Halo
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Me: more races
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sounds like fiun
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: fun*
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Me: each can take advatage of a certain weapon set and some inbetween
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whoot
[11/13/2005 06:26 PM] Me: Helion, Necromonger, Human
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: there will be more
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you just watched that movie didnt you
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: watched it last night
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: watching it now
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Dan Fairaizl: very nice
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: its so different from a matrix movie
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: what do you think?
[11/13/2005 06:27 PM] Me: we could call it Helion
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Me: we should read the books
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: perhaps
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: reading hmmm
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Me: yeah
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i tried that and its hard to do here
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Me: but it will give us more elaborate ideas
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Dan Fairaizl: true
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Me: Elemental will be another race
[11/13/2005 06:28 PM] Me: i've never heard of a game like this
[11/13/2005 06:29 PM] Me: but it will just be multiplayer
[11/13/2005 06:29 PM] Me: like your team is that certain race, and when you join you will choose which team to be on
[11/13/2005 06:29 PM] Me: there will be vehicles
[11/13/2005 06:29 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be pretty cool
[11/13/2005 06:29 PM] Me: kind of like CoD
[11/13/2005 06:30 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ??
[11/13/2005 06:30 PM] Me: when you join either Allied Powers or the other one
[11/13/2005 06:30 PM] Me: i can't remember
[11/13/2005 06:30 PM] Me: we could find some other team too
[11/13/2005 06:31 PM] Me: like Cremetorians or something
[11/13/2005 06:31 PM] Me: the prisoners
[11/13/2005 06:32 PM] Me: i need to watch pitch black
[11/13/2005 06:32 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah its badass, not a whole lot to do with the second one, but it will make more since
[11/13/2005 06:34 PM] Me: story games are fun but i think it would be better to just do a multiplaer
[11/13/2005 06:34 PM] Me: *multiplayer
[11/13/2005 06:34 PM] Me: especially for a first
[11/13/2005 06:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: easier thats for sure
[11/13/2005 06:34 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/13/2005 06:36 PM] Me: each race will have their own base on a farely large map
[11/13/2005 06:36 PM] Me: everything will be destroyable
[11/13/2005 06:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be cool
[11/13/2005 06:37 PM] Me: for the different maps we could use scenes or designs from the movie
[11/13/2005 06:37 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i love destructable maps
[11/13/2005 06:37 PM] Me: based on the different planets
[11/13/2005 06:38 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cool
[11/13/2005 06:39 PM] Me: are you gonna work at the marriot over thanksgiving?
[11/13/2005 06:39 PM] Me: would you want to hang out saturday or sunday?
[11/13/2005 06:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no im not going to work it wont be worth it, and yeah i want to hang out
[11/13/2005 06:39 PM] Dan Fairaizl: im going to be working on my car most of the time
[11/13/2005 06:40 PM] Me: ok then we can elaborate on this idea then and maybe spend some time on an aluminum case
[11/13/2005 06:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah man if you have a test case, bring it to my place and we can work on it
[11/13/2005 06:40 PM] Me: i will take screen shots from the movie of what i think would play a significant role in the game
[11/13/2005 06:40 PM] Dan Fairaizl: cool cool
[11/13/2005 06:40 PM] Me: i can get a case probably
[11/13/2005 06:41 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool
[11/13/2005 06:42 PM] Me: omg if each team has a certain weapon that was really powerful
[11/13/2005 06:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah exactly
[11/13/2005 06:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was thinkin that
[11/13/2005 06:43 PM] Me: the necromonger staff
[11/13/2005 06:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/13/2005 06:43 PM] Me: the Furion where he is on his knees and flips out after that vision and kills all those guys
[11/13/2005 06:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: heh heh heh yeah
[11/13/2005 06:45 PM] Me: there could be a certain time when a Necromonger can teleport
[11/13/2005 06:46 PM] Me: and in the game it could show that streak thing
[11/13/2005 06:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: or or, freak out and have time slow wayyy down
[11/13/2005 06:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: and just kick ass really fast
[11/13/2005 06:47 PM] Me: yeah that would be cool
[11/13/2005 06:47 PM] Me: but we would have to make it so that no other clients that are necromongers can use the ability at the same time
[11/13/2005 06:48 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thatd be cool
[11/13/2005 06:48 PM] Me: so all the other clients would just move really really slow
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: exactly
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Me: as the one with the ability would move with haste and you would be able to see a trail
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: very tight
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Me: we could even make the ability a pick up, inside the base
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Me: along with the staff
[11/13/2005 06:49 PM] Me: hmmm
[11/13/2005 06:50 PM] Me: modeling is going to be the hardest
[11/13/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: omfg yeah thats going to be really hard
[11/13/2005 06:50 PM] Me: but worth it?
[11/13/2005 06:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah id say that could be cool
[11/13/2005 06:50 PM] Me: physics will be semi difficult to add the time changing
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Me: other then that its just a matter of replacement
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: well i dont know about that
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Me: we replace the hud, the skins, the maps, the weapons
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: well if everything is moving forward at like 1 unit per second, we just cut that way down
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[11/13/2005 06:51 PM] Me: we will have to add a filter on which weapons can be used be which races
[11/13/2005 06:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[11/13/2005 06:52 PM] Me: not too difficult but i need to look at some engine code
[11/13/2005 06:52 PM] Me: as usual mapping will be the easiest and most possible, but it will take the longest
[11/13/2005 06:53 PM] Me: so i will have to do modeling to for everything i need in my map
[11/13/2005 06:53 PM] Me: it will be similar to HL2 Source
[11/13/2005 06:53 PM] Me: but with less steps for managing the files
[11/13/2005 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah but hopefully we can actually work with that engine
[11/13/2005 06:53 PM] Dan Fairaizl: more so that the hl2 one
[11/13/2005 06:55 PM] Me: you want to work on the Quake 4 engine or the HL2 engine?
[11/13/2005 06:55 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lets look at the quake engine and see how it works
[11/13/2005 06:57 PM] Me: definitely
[11/13/2005 06:57 PM] Me: their SDK will be released soon
[11/13/2005 06:58 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok cool deal
[11/13/2005 06:59 PM] Me: and turns out the mapping editor they give with the game IS GTK Radiant with id Software's input
[11/13/2005 06:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: so you know it then?
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Me: its prettier
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok good
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Me: then the old one
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Me: but i need more realestate on my desktop to fill up
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Me: that's why i want that 1600x1200 monitor
[11/13/2005 07:00 PM] Me: but i need about 280 more dollars
[11/13/2005 07:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ok well keep working on that, sell your body if you have to. :-P
[11/13/2005 07:02 PM] Me: lol
[11/13/2005 07:02 PM] Me: yes i am gonna go prostitute myself
[11/13/2005 07:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: depends on how bad you want that monitor
[11/13/2005 07:04 PM] Me: yeah
[11/13/2005 07:06 PM] Me: i really want it
[11/13/2005 07:06 PM] Me: its beautiful
[11/13/2005 07:06 PM] Dan Fairaizl: you should get two of them thatd be hot
[11/13/2005 07:08 PM] Me: omfg yeah
[11/13/2005 07:08 PM] Me: maybe i will ask my dad for another one next year

[11/13/2005 07:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: that Polk stuff?
[11/13/2005 07:10 PM] Me: yeah
[11/13/2005 07:10 PM] Me: and the sony 100w sub
[11/13/2005 07:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats really cool
[11/13/2005 07:14 PM] Me: Greg is a bitch
[11/13/2005 07:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lmao
[11/13/2005 07:15 PM] Me: tell him hes a fuck and Quake 4 came out two and a half weeks ago
[11/13/2005 07:24 PM] Me: get Quake 4
[11/13/2005 07:24 PM] Me: and beat it
[11/13/2005 07:25 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol ok
[11/13/2005 07:25 PM] Me: you know you can afford it, the Marriott pays enough

[12/22/2005 11:07 PM] Me: shes one of those types where she has a fortune because her husband started vaccuform and its like i am the only person in the world who knows what that is since i was like 5, but anyways, shes old and was really poor growing up so she doesn't understand that at her age money can be spent not saved
[12/22/2005 11:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol thats like the same way my grandma was, but she wouldnt spend a dime, and gave half a million to the government, that all could have been spent...
[12/22/2005 11:08 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh well
[12/22/2005 11:08 PM] Me: yeah sucks
[12/22/2005 11:09 PM] Me: oh vaccuform just incase you were wondering
[12/22/2005 11:09 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh yeah
[12/22/2005 11:10 PM] Me: its like a mold that has very small holes in it, and a sheet of metal is laid over that mold and heated up to become really soft then the air is sucked out of the mold really fast to pull the heated sheet of metal into the mold
[12/22/2005 11:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: whoa...
[12/22/2005 11:11 PM] Me: i used to have this toy car set where you could make you own body to the car and you could heat up plastic and then it would get real soft and the you pull on a little level and it sucks the air out, that's how i learned what vaccuform is
[12/22/2005 11:12 PM] Me: its pretty cool, good idea
[12/22/2005 11:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats yeah an extremely good idea
[12/22/2005 11:12 PM] Me: anywho that how my grandpa made signs

[12/22/2005 11:13 PM] Me: no my dad started his own business but was inspired by working for my grandpa
[12/22/2005 11:13 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh good deal
[12/22/2005 11:14 PM] Me: since my dad was the last of the kids my grandpa already retired by the time my dad started his business
[12/22/2005 11:14 PM] Me: yeah i would like to inherit my father business since its obviously thriving, but my sister also wants a slice of the cake

[12/23/2005 02:56 PM] *** Auto-response sent to Dan Fairaizl: "It sounds like someone dangerous wrote this, and this buttoned-down psychotic could probably snap at any moment and stalk from office to office with an Armalite AR-180 Carbine gas-operated semiautomatic.  He's probably at home every 
night with a little rattail file, filing a cross into the tip of every 
one of his bullets.  This way, when he pumps a round into ... *someone* 
... it will split along the filed grooves and spread open the way a dum 
dum flowers inside you to blow a load of guts out through *someone's* 
spine.  This is probably somebody you've know for years."

[12/25/2005 10:42 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i know
[12/25/2005 10:42 PM] Me: but i probably woke him considering the music plays in his room too
[12/25/2005 10:43 PM] Me: but then i switched to just use the front speakers
[12/25/2005 10:43 PM] Me: hes gonna be so proud
[12/25/2005 10:43 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[12/25/2005 10:44 PM] Me: he has a pretty heavy duty sony receiver
[12/25/2005 10:44 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i can only imagine
[12/25/2005 10:45 PM] Me: omfg ok stupidest thing i've seen him do
[12/25/2005 10:46 PM] Me: ok ok so there is this brand bang & olufson ever heard of them?
[12/25/2005 10:46 PM] Dan Fairaizl: no
[12/25/2005 10:46 PM] Me: exactly
[12/25/2005 10:47 PM] Me: so he spends 1,500+ like it was nothing
[12/25/2005 10:47 PM] Dan Fairaizl: ouch
[12/25/2005 10:49 PM] Me: so the converter for the cable that changes (Link: http://www.tcmidi.com/midiwhat.htm)http://www.tcmidi.com/midiwhat.htm that shaped output (i don't know the name of the cord) to analog RCA jacks was 50 bucks
[12/25/2005 10:49 PM] Me: that's something you could find at a guitar shop for 10
[12/25/2005 10:49 PM] Dan Fairaizl: sure
[12/25/2005 10:50 PM] Me: its not just used for MIDI but my step dad steve didn't understand what i was asking so couldn't explain to me how a microphone uses the same jack as an electric piano
[12/25/2005 10:50 PM] Me: but anywho
[12/25/2005 10:50 PM] Me: there is no fucking way any cd, and especially not an mp3 could use up all 1,500 dollars of goodness
[12/25/2005 10:50 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol so its wasted?
[12/25/2005 10:51 PM] Me: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_rate
[12/25/2005 10:52 PM] Me: its just not possible i love that article
[12/25/2005 10:52 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh yeah
[12/25/2005 10:53 PM] Me: it wasn't that exact one let me find it
[12/25/2005 10:55 PM] Me: (Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_sound_vs._digital_so(Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_sound_vs._digital_sound)und
[12/25/2005 10:55 PM] Me: that's the one that really enlightens on sound quality
[12/25/2005 10:55 PM] Me: and with understanding that i will never spend 1,500 on a sound system
[12/25/2005 10:56 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah no kidding
[12/25/2005 10:56 PM] Me: so the only way to get a truly pure sound would be optical input and output on the speak and that had neither, and original wave recordings of the artist
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Me: not burned to a cd and recopied even to a way
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Me: original wav
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Me: what a whore
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Me: he makes me angry
[12/25/2005 10:57 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol
[12/25/2005 10:58 PM] Me: hey what is the name of that secure server?
[12/25/2005 10:58 PM] Me: the https server
[12/25/2005 10:59 PM] Me: Dano
[12/25/2005 10:59 PM] Dan Fairaizl: err OpenSSL
[12/25/2005 11:00 PM] Me: ok so we should further exploit websense
[12/25/2005 11:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: do it
[12/25/2005 11:01 PM] Me: so if a secure request is made to an unblocked website, then the client makes a request to a non secure site through the unblocked secure connection the request will be completed
[12/25/2005 11:01 PM] Dan Fairaizl: wh00t
[12/25/2005 11:03 PM] Me: OR the secure request is made but then the server makes the request to the blocked site, the server is not the one with websites, the client is, so if the secure server returns the nonsecure blocked content that would probably be easier to do but of course take up twice as much bandwidth
[12/25/2005 11:03 PM] Dan Fairaizl: why does it matter are you being controled by websense?
[12/25/2005 11:03 PM] Me: since PHP is server side, why not just do an include to a non secure blocked site
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Me: its seems so simple, PHP can include anything right? even an http address?
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Me: i'm not controlled by it but i know people who are
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Dan Fairaizl: n00bs
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Me: so the PHP server is the one making the non secure request to filtered material right?
[12/25/2005 11:04 PM] Me: how did you get around websense back in our day?
[12/25/2005 11:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: never bothered lol
[12/25/2005 11:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: i was busy doing other things
[12/25/2005 11:05 PM] Me: theoretically this should work right?
[12/25/2005 11:05 PM] Me: this idea
[12/25/2005 11:05 PM] Dan Fairaizl: theoretically
[12/25/2005 11:06 PM] Me: maybe the server doesn't have to be secured at all
[12/25/2005 11:06 PM] Me: just as long as the server makes the request to the blocked content and not the client
[12/25/2005 11:06 PM] Me: because websense can control the computer at school, but not my computer at home
[12/25/2005 11:07 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah as long as the server makes the requets and forwards it to the client it should work
[12/25/2005 11:07 PM] Me: and my dad says this is a better search engine (Link: http://teoma.com/)http://teoma.com/
[12/25/2005 11:07 PM] Me: i am a genius
[12/25/2005 11:07 PM] Me: and another thing i was talking to my uncle about that he was amazed at what a great idea it was
[12/25/2005 11:07 PM] Me: when developing an application that you want to be cross platform
[12/25/2005 11:09 PM] Me: develop the core functions and routines in C because C is cross platform and compile it as a DLL and resource file with the compiler of your choice, then just rewrite the GUI stuff specifically on the platform and use the core already compiled and save a lot of time
[12/25/2005 11:10 PM] Dan Fairaizl: how do you know the dll can be used by that OS's software?
[12/25/2005 11:10 PM] Me: well it wouldn't be a DLL specifically but the code would stay the same the IDE and compiler would change
[12/25/2005 11:11 PM] Me: so yeah you could compile it on one select platform but you could write the core functions on any platform then recompile it on the others
[12/25/2005 11:11 PM] Dan Fairaizl: seems like most of the work is still implementing the GUI to be able to use the core
[12/25/2005 11:11 PM] Me: yeah it depends on how extensive you go with the core
[12/25/2005 11:12 PM] Me: it depends on which libraries are cross platform
[12/25/2005 11:12 PM] Me: but C++ is pretty broad
[12/25/2005 11:12 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah there are a lot of factors there 
[12/25/2005 11:12 PM] Me: yeah but if you think, applications can be written in eclipse and eclipse runs on linux
[12/25/2005 11:13 PM] Me: so the libraries can't vary that much
[12/25/2005 11:13 PM] Me: many just the object oriented stuff would be platform specific
[12/25/2005 11:13 PM] Me: otherwise you would save a lot of time developing if you used unmanaged code cross platform compatible
[12/25/2005 11:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/25/2005 11:14 PM] Me: i thought it was a good idea
[12/25/2005 11:14 PM] Me: not if only there was a system that offered each platforms compiler on each platform, like i could compile for any version of linux on a windows platform
[12/25/2005 11:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah
[12/25/2005 11:15 PM] Me: and the OS X platforms don't come with a compiler, you have to write the end result yourself because of the auqa gui
[12/25/2005 11:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: fun
[12/25/2005 11:15 PM] Me: sucks
[12/25/2005 11:15 PM] Me: but i g2g to bed

[12/27/2005 11:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol very nice man
[12/27/2005 11:14 PM] Me: and put our arms around eachother
[12/27/2005 11:14 PM] Dan Fairaizl: still getting mixed signals?
[12/27/2005 11:14 PM] Me: still
[12/27/2005 11:14 PM] Me: we talked about the direction of our relationship, somehow it came up
[12/27/2005 11:15 PM] Me: there was the options of being friends or being more
[12/27/2005 11:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: oh crap ol
[12/27/2005 11:15 PM] Dan Fairaizl: lol*
[12/27/2005 11:15 PM] Me: she said it was mixed, she didn't want to start anything because she would be able to finish because i live there and she lives here
[12/27/2005 11:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah 
[12/27/2005 11:16 PM] Me: she asked what i wanted,
[12/27/2005 11:16 PM] Me: i said i didn't know, but when i come back during the summer we can spend more time together
[12/27/2005 11:16 PM] Dan Fairaizl: yeah i think thats a good idea
[12/27/2005 11:17 PM] Me: and that i have always respected her wanting to stay just friends, i've never made a move that would change that, but i told her i have always been attracted to her
[12/27/2005 11:17 PM] Dan Fairaizl: playing it safe
[12/27/2005 11:18 PM] Dan Fairaizl: man id be happy with that
[12/27/2005 11:18 PM] Me: so the mixed signals were the hold hands, and being close, and talking about our relationship, but also she sat with me infront of a movie so close light couldn't pass through under a blanket too, and she massaged my hand and let me put my arm around her
[12/27/2005 11:19 PM] Me: but unless i am here, it will never go anywhere
[12/27/2005 11:20 PM] Dan Fairaizl: just enjoy it man

[12/27/2005 11:22 PM] Dan Fairaizl: thats whats going to make this so difficult, i cant deal with long distance things, thats one of the reasons i broke up with my old girl friend
