[10/02/2005 09:15 PM] Alex Childers: you have to know, she's like my sister, basically she's saying u break my heart she breaks your face
[10/02/2005 09:15 PM] Alex Childers: get it now?
[10/02/2005 09:17 PM] Me: first of all, i don't reckon (its a cracker term) that i am like most guys and that i'm actually quite comfortable with myself, i also find it ironic that i am writing an essay about masculinity and how society puts pressure on to molding the perfect man which in turn causes many men to be socially insecure, it is that image of most guys that is the true problem in society today
[10/02/2005 09:18 PM] Alex Childers: i see...well we're from LA where most stereotypes are how ppl really do act so she just wants to make sure we have that clear...she's just lookin out for me

[10/03/2005 11:04 PM] Me: even though i do all the stuff like open all the doors, walk on the street side of the sidewalk, or be polite in fancy restaurants and pay on dates, my relationships with girls always end bad, so i blamed myself, and i don't want a girlfriend
[10/03/2005 11:05 PM] Me: if we were to be "going out" and i did something to fuck it up i wouldn't forgive myself, and we wouldn't be friends afterwards
[10/03/2005 11:05 PM] Me: i don't want that to happen
[10/03/2005 11:05 PM] Alex Childers: ok first of all i don't think a guy needs to do any of that shit, personally...second don't blame urself i don't think u fucked everything up....i would totally still be ur friend! u could never fuck up that badly
[10/03/2005 11:05 PM] Alex Childers: unless u act like david

[10/07/2005 08:26 PM] Alex Childers: brian i already told u, u could NEVER fuck things up so badly that we wouldn't be friends afterwards
[10/07/2005 08:26 PM] Me: alright
[10/07/2005 08:27 PM] Alex Childers: so where does that leave us?
[10/07/2005 08:27 PM] Me: just calm down, if you happen to be over late enough and its appropriate for you to spend the night then fine
[10/07/2005 08:27 PM] Me: i want to be close friends, i want to be around you and spend time with you
[10/07/2005 08:28 PM] Me: i just can't handle a girlfriend now
[10/07/2005 08:28 PM] Alex Childers: that's fine but i'm not doing this friends w/ benefits shit
[10/07/2005 08:28 PM] Me: i'm not going to give you the line, "its me not you" because i wouldn't believe anyone if they said it to me
[10/07/2005 08:28 PM] Alex Childers: nor would i
[10/07/2005 08:29 PM] Me: i'm just not comfortable with having a girlfriend
[10/07/2005 08:29 PM] Me: and friends with benefits is BS but that's kind of what happened last weekend
[10/07/2005 08:29 PM] Alex Childers: may i ask y?
[10/07/2005 08:30 PM] Alex Childers: the whole girlfriend thing i honestly don't get it still
[10/07/2005 08:30 PM] Alex Childers: i mean i understand u don't want one but i don't get y
[10/07/2005 08:30 PM] Me: because like you said, i flirt, none of my relationships with girlfriends ended well
[10/07/2005 08:30 PM] Me: i figure if i am just friends with people then there isn't anyone for me to mess it up
[10/07/2005 08:31 PM] Me: and don't say ther eis no way for me to mess it up, that's bullshit, what is this?  this is us arguing about not spending time together
[10/07/2005 08:31 PM] Me: that's messing it up
[10/07/2005 08:31 PM] Me: and its my fault
[10/07/2005 08:31 PM] Me: as usual
[10/07/2005 08:32 PM] Me: if we never spent the night together we wouldn't be talking about this and we would have been close friends sooner and longer
[10/07/2005 08:32 PM] Alex Childers: ok well i really need to leave now so can we do this later?
[10/07/2005 08:33 PM] Me: i am tired now

[11/12/2005 11:16 AM] Me: wtf?
[11/12/2005 11:16 AM] Me: because there is black porn?
[11/12/2005 11:16 AM] Alex Childers: i guess i dunno. i guess it was more that he told her to look
[11/12/2005 11:16 AM] Me: that's the exact reason no one likes black people and other minorities
[11/12/2005 11:16 AM] Alex Childers: b/c they're easily offended?
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Me: because they take everything personally
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Alex Childers: yeah...and she really does. even tho she laughs when ppl piss her off she really is seriously pissed
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Me: that's so fucked up, you think that if i showed some white chick white lesbian porn do you think she would care?
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Alex Childers: like when u were talking like u were ghetto
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Me: fuck no, shed probably giggle and ignore it
[11/12/2005 11:17 AM] Alex Childers: probably
[11/12/2005 11:18 AM] Me: i don't give a shit if some black person calls me a honkey or cracka'
[11/12/2005 11:18 AM] Me: both of which are racist names, but if i call minorities racist names shit goes down
[11/12/2005 11:19 AM] Alex Childers: and i hate that there's such a double standard like that
[11/12/2005 11:19 AM] Me: that's so fucked up, people believe that only white people can be racist, that's not true, other minorities can be racist to its just the white people don't really give a shit, and that makes them even more angry
[11/12/2005 11:20 AM] Me: fuck that, fuck them hard in the ass on film
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Alex Childers: wow
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Me: now if you show courtney this convo she'll be like, "aw heel no, no he di'n't"
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Alex Childers: yeah she'd kick ur ass and never speak to u again
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Me: good
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Alex Childers: ?
[11/12/2005 11:21 AM] Me: one less racist minority
[11/12/2005 11:22 AM] Alex Childers: damn...pretty harsh
[11/12/2005 11:22 AM] Me: that's true
[11/12/2005 11:22 AM] Me: but i can admit i'm being pretty harsh
[11/12/2005 11:23 AM] Alex Childers: yeah
[11/12/2005 11:23 AM] Me: but can she admit that all the arguments previously stated are true? "heel no"
[11/12/2005 11:23 AM] Alex Childers: most of what ur saying is true but if u try to tell any minority it is they get pissed
[11/12/2005 11:24 AM] Alex Childers: and i mean i love courtney but she totally plays into like all the stereotypes
[11/12/2005 11:24 AM] Alex Childers: and then gets pissed when ppl say she is
[11/12/2005 11:24 AM] Me: yeah well if minorities have something to say to the white people that they don't like go ahead and say, i'll try my best to fix it
[11/12/2005 11:25 AM] Alex Childers: what'd u mean?
[11/12/2005 11:26 AM] Me: she would be pissed off at me for stating what is wrong with our culture, but if she has something to say to me, that's perfectly fine with me, another example of racism
[11/12/2005 11:27 AM] Alex Childers: right 
[11/12/2005 11:28 AM] Me: this is one fucked up society we live in
[11/12/2005 11:29 AM] Alex Childers: it really is. i learned that a while ago, especially living in LA
[11/12/2005 11:31 AM] Me: yeah definitely
[11/12/2005 11:31 AM] Me: now i don't have minorities at all, they hate me
[11/12/2005 11:32 AM] Alex Childers: well courtney doesn't hate u
[11/12/2005 11:32 AM] Alex Childers: u just piss her off sometimes 
[11/12/2005 11:32 AM] Me: the only time she pisses me off is when she gets pissed off at me for stupid shit
[11/12/2005 11:32 AM] Alex Childers: which she does a lot
[11/12/2005 11:33 AM] Me: that's fucked up
[11/12/2005 11:33 AM] Me: so shes the one being a hata' not me
[11/12/2005 11:34 AM] Alex Childers: lol yeah she is a hata' lol
[11/12/2005 11:36 AM] Alex Childers: and if she reads this convo she's gonna bust a cap in yo ass
[11/12/2005 11:37 AM] Alex Childers: and may i just say i love the fact that u said hata'

[11/12/2005 11:38 AM] Me: i'm gonna make her work for this relationship
[11/12/2005 11:39 AM] Me: shes gonna have to stop being a white man hater if she wants to be friends
[11/12/2005 11:39 AM] Alex Childers: lol
[11/12/2005 11:39 AM] Alex Childers: i'm just gonna warn u right now she's gonna kill u
[11/12/2005 11:40 AM] Me: good
