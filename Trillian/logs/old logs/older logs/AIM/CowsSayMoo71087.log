[10/04/2005 01:39 PM] Me: how can you hate it so much when you do it to me all the time?
[10/04/2005 01:40 PM] Me: most of my comments aren't even mean!  you should appreciate my pathetic attempts to express verbal affection towards you
[10/04/2005 01:40 PM] Megan O: i dont mind if they are mean
[10/04/2005 01:40 PM] Megan O: i hate compliments
[10/04/2005 01:40 PM] Me: i don't understand that
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Me: why?
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: i dont know
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: thats just how i have always been
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Me: does it make you feel bad that people like you?
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: sort of
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: its hard to explain
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: i just dont like them because i think people say that stuff because they have to
[10/04/2005 01:41 PM] Megan O: and that it isnt sincere
[10/04/2005 01:42 PM] Megan O: and if someone who hears the other say that they might not agree
[10/04/2005 01:42 PM] Megan O: and make some other comment
[10/04/2005 01:42 PM] Megan O: i dunno
[10/04/2005 01:42 PM] Me: dude i wear my heart on my sleve
[10/04/2005 01:42 PM] Me: i wouldn't say those things unless i was sincere
[10/04/2005 01:43 PM] Me: i was attracted to you long before you started being mean to me, and since then all i wanted was acceptance
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Megan O: and i accept you if you stop complimenting me
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Me: i honestly believe that you have a lot to offer, that's why last night i couldn't understand why you could be so upset over a guy
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Megan O: i dont have a guy
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Megan O: and thats a good thing
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Megan O: megan is on the market but not looking for anything
[10/04/2005 01:44 PM] Me: good
[10/04/2005 01:45 PM] Me: its a good idea to wait for someone to come along and sweep you off your feet
[10/04/2005 01:45 PM] Me: no point in stressing out about it
[10/04/2005 01:45 PM] Me: but you deserve a guy
[10/04/2005 01:46 PM] Megan O: i have two
[10/04/2005 01:46 PM] Megan O: thats the problem
[10/04/2005 01:46 PM] Megan O: so i decided that if i have neither that makes it all better
[10/04/2005 01:46 PM] Me: well, lucky you
[10/04/2005 01:46 PM] Me: just be polyamorous
[10/04/2005 01:47 PM] Me: its a good idea
[10/04/2005 01:47 PM] Me: have an open relationship with both guys

[10/04/2005 01:49 PM] Me: ?
[10/04/2005 01:50 PM] Me: i think people put to much pressure on that kind of relationship
[10/04/2005 01:50 PM] Megan O: i dunno wht i am doing
[10/04/2005 01:50 PM] Me: you should do whatever is most convenient for you and not worry about the other guy, he'll get over it
[10/04/2005 01:53 PM] Megan O: but icant do that
[10/04/2005 01:54 PM] Megan O: because i care about how people feel
