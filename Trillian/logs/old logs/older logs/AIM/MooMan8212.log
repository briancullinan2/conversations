[10/04/2005 05:30 PM] Me: Hey Chris
[10/04/2005 05:30 PM] MooMan8212: hi
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] Me: The diagram of the hubs must not have shown up right
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] MooMan8212: probably not, I don't use IE so it doesn't rich format the text.  and it looks all shitty
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] MooMan8212: ill paste what I meant
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] Me: i don't use IE either, what do you take me for a noob?
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] Me: I was thinking 4 routers plugged into 1 hub making all 16 connection the same level
[10/04/2005 05:31 PM] MooMan8212: well I don't use FireFox either
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] Me: oh yeah what browser?
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] MooMan8212: Opera
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] Me: its alright, but you have to pay for it don';t you?
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] Me: i mean pay for it technically
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] MooMan8212: no
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] MooMan8212: they got  rid of the Ads on it
[10/04/2005 05:32 PM] MooMan8212: there's no plugins for it, but it's the fastest.  and i heard about it before firefox and im to stubborn
[10/04/2005 05:33 PM] Me: anywho, i understand what you were saying about having to go through two hubs, its basically the same idea you presented, except with normal 4 port hubs and using all the ports
[10/04/2005 05:33 PM] Me: the reason i am confident in my method is because i doubt there are many games that actually could make use of gigabit ethernet
[10/04/2005 05:33 PM] MooMan8212: give me a second
[10/04/2005 05:34 PM] Me: actually sorry i am confusing both of us, i mean use all routers not hubs
[10/04/2005 05:34 PM] MooMan8212: 
 Hub1  -    Hub 2
  |             |
 Hub3       Hub 4
  |             |
 Hub5  -   Hub 6  
[10/04/2005 05:34 PM] Me: hmmm
[10/04/2005 05:34 PM] Me: interesting
[10/04/2005 05:35 PM] Me: i am not used to using hubs
[10/04/2005 05:35 PM] MooMan8212: is the best for self containing networks.  because the furthest a packet goes is 2 hubs at any point
[10/04/2005 05:35 PM] MooMan8212: by hub I mean router
[10/04/2005 05:35 PM] Me: yeah
[10/04/2005 05:35 PM] Me: so we are using all 2 port routers with no wep usage?
[10/04/2005 05:36 PM] MooMan8212: I guess I don't know what you mean by WEP, isn't wep a security protical?
[10/04/2005 05:36 PM] Me: yeah i don't use hubs, i think the main difference between a hub and a router is when it comes to dividing up the WEP
[10/04/2005 05:36 PM] MooMan8212: Wired Equivalent Privacy?
[10/04/2005 05:37 PM] Me: no
[10/04/2005 05:37 PM] Me: hold on
[10/04/2005 05:37 PM] Me: the place you plug in the internet connection to be routed
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] Me: i must be using the wrong term
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] MooMan8212: oh opposed to any port on the router being allowed in?
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] Me: yes
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] MooMan8212: circular should still work
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] Me: yeah
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] MooMan8212: because even then UDP is just as fast as TCP
[10/04/2005 05:38 PM] Me: gosh what is that called
[10/04/2005 05:39 PM] MooMan8212: what exactly does it do?
[10/04/2005 05:39 PM] Me: is it WAN
[10/04/2005 05:39 PM] Me: yeah
[10/04/2005 05:39 PM] Me: sorry
[10/04/2005 05:40 PM] MooMan8212: oh okay, that makes sense
[10/04/2005 05:40 PM] Me: yes i am talking about doing your circular setup but how would that effect the WAN
[10/04/2005 05:40 PM] MooMan8212: doesn't it have more than one output?
[10/04/2005 05:41 PM] Me: well the WAN is where it plugs into the wall then a router divides up that signal to all the ports
[10/04/2005 05:41 PM] MooMan8212: or
[10/04/2005 05:41 PM] MooMan8212: are you talking about the group?
[10/04/2005 05:41 PM] MooMan8212: got it, so you want to be able to connect to other people outside of the room?
[10/04/2005 05:41 PM] Me: yeah
[10/04/2005 05:42 PM] Me: with my setup, with the 4 routers plugged into 1 router, then the WAN plugged into that 1 router, yeah there is a lot more divisions but not many people can take advantage of gigabit lan anyways
[10/04/2005 05:43 PM] Me: and since most routers are gigabit lan now, you would have to have a pretty high end adapter that not many games can take advantage of either
[10/04/2005 05:44 PM] Me: with your setup i am not sure where in the circle we would plug in the WAN so that all the computers could use it
[10/04/2005 05:44 PM] MooMan8212:           WAN
               |
            Router
            /        \
      Router   Router
         |             |
    Router     Router
          \          /
          Router
[10/04/2005 05:44 PM] MooMan8212: I guess either way it would be the same
[10/04/2005 05:45 PM] Me: yeah it might work
[10/04/2005 05:45 PM] Me: so we need to get people to participate in the group now that a few have joined
[10/04/2005 05:45 PM] Me: are you going to participate?
