[07/26/2006 01:23 PM] Melissa White: just busy at work
[07/26/2006 01:24 PM] Me: that's cool, i just bought more computer parts
[07/26/2006 01:24 PM] Me: i am at work also, but i don't really have anything important to do, so i usually end up just reading about stuff
[07/26/2006 01:24 PM] Melissa White: cool cool
[07/26/2006 01:24 PM] Me: i am going to have 2 computers in the dorm next year
[07/26/2006 01:25 PM] Melissa White: cool
[07/26/2006 01:25 PM] Me: yeah, and i'm going to run Gentoo Linux server like dave does
[07/26/2006 01:25 PM] Me: i am excited
[07/26/2006 01:25 PM] Melissa White: sounds like fun
[07/26/2006 01:26 PM] Me: yeah but i will also be spending sleepless nights trying to get linux to work, i have never built a completely linux system before
[07/26/2006 01:26 PM] Melissa White: not too bad
[07/26/2006 01:27 PM] Melissa White: i'm running ubuntu right now and really like it
[07/26/2006 01:27 PM] Melissa White: gentoo is muchmore manual on the set up
[07/26/2006 01:27 PM] Me: yes it is
[07/26/2006 01:27 PM] Melissa White: but once you get it running it should be pretty maintenance free
[07/26/2006 01:28 PM] Me: and it has a very customizable kernel
[07/26/2006 01:28 PM] Me: wow what desktop does ubuntu come with?
[07/26/2006 01:28 PM] Melissa White: gnome by default
[07/26/2006 01:29 PM] Me: oh ok
[07/26/2006 01:29 PM] Melissa White: but you can choose to run kde
[07/26/2006 01:29 PM] Me: the picture looked way different
[07/26/2006 01:29 PM] Me: i thinks its about time people start making new desktop shells
[07/26/2006 01:29 PM] Me: i am going to do that on windows, there is even an option in the policy settings to change the shell
[07/26/2006 01:30 PM] Me: real easy
