[12/28/2005 09:36 AM] Me: just to elaborate on one of the topics we discussed last night; although i have been in a friends with benefits relationship before, i would mot definitely chose the bf/gf relationship over that
[12/28/2005 09:38 AM] Me: and a more direct answer to your question "where i would like this relationship to go" i would really like to come back in the summer and maybe take it to the next level, however it is perfectly fine if at the time that's not what your looking for, i love all of the time we get to spend together no matter if we are just friends
