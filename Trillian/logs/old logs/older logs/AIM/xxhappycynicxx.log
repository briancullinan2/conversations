[10/13/2005 05:27 PM] Me: i heard band sucks
[10/13/2005 05:27 PM] Me: but you guys are having fun?
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Brianna: I don't think so
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Me: you're not having fun?
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Brianna: not really
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Me: sorry to hear that
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Me: are you going to do it in college?
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Brianna: no
[10/13/2005 05:28 PM] Brianna: I never planned on it
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Me: have you thought about where you want to go for college?
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Brianna: yeah
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Me: where?
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Brianna: well, maybe Texas actually
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Me: that's cool
[10/13/2005 05:29 PM] Me: do you have any family there?
[10/13/2005 05:30 PM] Brianna: probably
[10/13/2005 05:30 PM] Brianna: I've probably not met even a third of my mom's family
[10/13/2005 05:30 PM] Brianna: and there's probably a good deal of them in Texas
[10/13/2005 05:30 PM] Me: yeah i don't know a lot of my great aunt's kids
[10/13/2005 05:31 PM] Me: i just know they exist, i don't know anything about them though
[10/13/2005 05:31 PM] Me: i won't get to see pinnacle perform, i am on parking lot duty
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Brianna: might be a good thing
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Brianna: so you don't laugh at us
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Brianna: but your dad has tons of tapes
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Brianna: you can watch those and see
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Me: well, i might come tomorrow
[10/13/2005 05:33 PM] Me: to the pregame
[10/13/2005 05:34 PM] Brianna: I don't know if it's worth driving 4 hours for it
[10/13/2005 05:34 PM] Me: eh, something to do, campus is pretty boring
[10/13/2005 05:34 PM] Brianna: I've heard
[10/13/2005 05:35 PM] Me: how do you like the show?  is it fun to march?
[10/13/2005 05:35 PM] Brianna: well, the music is pretty dramatic
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Me: yeah? so no dancing then?
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Brianna: the first song was hard to march at first because it's in 5/4 so we have right foot step-offs
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Me: wow, that's crazy
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Brianna: yeh
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Brianna: *yeah
[10/13/2005 05:36 PM] Me: our music is pretty easy
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Me: and we are shitty
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Brianna: and it changes time signatures like at least 3 or 4 times
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Me: we don't even know all of our show
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Me: wow
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Brianna: we have all of our 3 songs
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Brianna: they're kind of messy
[10/13/2005 05:37 PM] Me: our drum majors just switch from 4/4 to conducting in half time ocassionaly
[10/13/2005 05:38 PM] Brianna: oh
[10/13/2005 05:38 PM] Me: yeah we have been pretty busy learning different parts of pregame because of different events
[10/13/2005 05:38 PM] Me: like Mountain blast we had to learn where to put the little ankle biters
[10/13/2005 05:38 PM] Brianna: in the beginning of Mars they conduct the 5/4 in like 3 and 2 and then at this one section they change to conducting it in 5
[10/13/2005 05:39 PM] Me: and then family weekend we worked on pregame with our parents
[10/13/2005 05:39 PM] Me: that sounds confusing
[10/13/2005 05:39 PM] Brianna: oh
[10/13/2005 05:39 PM] Brianna: it's no good with freshmen and people who never get anything
[10/13/2005 05:39 PM] Brianna: like Venus, our second song, we march double time the whole time
[10/13/2005 05:40 PM] Me: wow
[10/13/2005 05:40 PM] Me: our show is so less complicated
[10/13/2005 05:40 PM] Me: we mess around a lot
[10/13/2005 05:40 PM] Brianna: people mess around
[10/13/2005 05:41 PM] Brianna: but it's happening less and less as other people and Ms. McGonigal freak out about it
[10/13/2005 05:41 PM] Brianna: we do fundamentals a lot
[10/13/2005 05:41 PM] Me: yeah, i heard ms mcgonigal sucks at teaching
[10/13/2005 05:41 PM] Brianna: she contradicts herself
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Me: yeah
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Me: and she changes the music and the show a lot?
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Brianna: she'll go on and on about thinking like the best band ever and then she says you shouldn't compare yourselves to other bands and just concentrate on improving yourself
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Me: yeah
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Me: how annoying
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Me: but she is probably more positive then old mrs E
[10/13/2005 05:42 PM] Brianna: yeah
[10/13/2005 05:43 PM] Brianna: she has random moments
[10/13/2005 05:43 PM] Me: hmm, our band director is awesome
[10/13/2005 05:43 PM] Me: shes from the south so she has a funny accent
[10/13/2005 05:43 PM] Me: and shes always positive
[10/13/2005 05:44 PM] Brianna: that's cool
[10/13/2005 05:44 PM] Me: the like lets us out of rehearsal early just because we don't feel like marching again
[10/13/2005 05:44 PM] Me: like wednesday we were supposed to run through the whole show at the end of practise and we stopped after the second song and she said alright i feel like we're done, and we ended rehearsal
[10/13/2005 05:45 PM] Me: shes really fun
[10/13/2005 05:45 PM] Brianna: cool
[10/13/2005 05:45 PM] Me: we don't always slack off though, like sometimes we will have a "quite rehearsal" where nobody talks, and there isn't really any talking, its pretty disciplined
[10/13/2005 05:46 PM] Brianna: well you don't really get that in high school bands
[10/13/2005 05:47 PM] Me: yeah
[10/13/2005 05:48 PM] Me: well Eric is being a douche bag so i think i am going to go escape
[10/13/2005 05:48 PM] Me: talk to you later
[10/13/2005 05:48 PM] Brianna: ok
[10/13/2005 05:48 PM] Brianna: bye
