[09/10/2005 01:09 AM] Me: you don't know?
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] ajw1293: possibly
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: what was the cell phone conversation about?
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: that?
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] ajw1293: no
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: i would't ask you for details
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] ajw1293: just random flirting kind of stuff
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: ah
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: goo stuff
[09/10/2005 01:10 AM] Me: *good
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] Me: dude, she is adorable, i would say keep playing that game and go for it
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] ajw1293: i know 2 rachels and we were talkin about which one was #1 and her she could be #1
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] Me: noice
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] Me: way to play
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] Me: the game
[09/10/2005 01:11 AM] ajw1293: here just read them
[09/10/2005 01:13 AM] Me: yeah that's kinda weird
[09/10/2005 01:13 AM] ajw1293: about shannon?
[09/10/2005 01:14 AM] Me: like i mention hey shes cute and your like yeah she is, agreed then you get the poon tang
[09/10/2005 01:14 AM] Me: its not fair
[09/10/2005 01:14 AM] Me: i think i have a personality flaw
[09/10/2005 01:15 AM] Me: texting messaging Rachel right after getting her number that IIIII asked for, was very agressive
[09/10/2005 01:15 AM] ajw1293: i feel like an ass for doin that though
[09/10/2005 01:16 AM] Me: but other people have told me i try to be to aggressive, like with Jessie and offering my lap as a seat the first night of meeting her, now she calls me creepy constantly
[09/10/2005 01:16 AM] Me: no man, don't feel like an ass take all you can get
[09/10/2005 01:16 AM] ajw1293: no but you get your eye on a girl and i get her
[09/10/2005 01:16 AM] ajw1293: its not fair
[09/10/2005 01:17 AM] Me: but what Shannon doesn't understand, and what you probably didn't explain to her, is that i like all women, not just one, i don
[09/10/2005 01:17 AM] Me: t like to think of that as a flaw
[09/10/2005 01:17 AM] Me: just more open minded
[09/10/2005 01:17 AM] ajw1293: yeah i totally agree
[09/10/2005 01:18 AM] Me: which is why if you are like me, you would rather know and have a lot of close female friends, that you can be seeing without actually having to pick just one
[09/10/2005 01:19 AM] ajw1293: yeah but if they're posessive then it gets kinda messy
[09/10/2005 01:19 AM] Me: yeah but people like us can handle it
[09/10/2005 01:21 AM] Me: now if we consider the most recent 3 girls, Jessie, Shannon, and Rachel, Rachel is too.... out there, she would have lots of guy friends, like we would have lots of female friends
[09/10/2005 01:21 AM] Me: Shannon already has a boyfriend
[09/10/2005 01:21 AM] Me: and Jessie thinks i am creepy, so once again i have no options and you have at least 3
[09/10/2005 01:21 AM] ajw1293: well maybe but not all those 3
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: yeah not shannon
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] ajw1293: not jessie either
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: why not jessie?
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: she is available?
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] ajw1293: that whole thing kinda fizzled out
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: oh
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] ajw1293: no she's available
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: well it happens
[09/10/2005 01:22 AM] Me: i don't think she is interested though
[09/10/2005 01:23 AM] Me: i mean you can definitely tell by her body language
[09/10/2005 01:23 AM] ajw1293: she gets kind of annoying sometimes though too
[09/10/2005 01:23 AM] Me: shes just not putting out like at all
[09/10/2005 01:23 AM] Me: nah i don't think i could get annoyed by her, is think she is adorable
[09/10/2005 01:24 AM] Me: but i can understand why you would think so, people just don't really bother me, only stupid people, i hate stupid people
[09/10/2005 01:24 AM] ajw1293: me too
[09/10/2005 01:24 AM] Me: so are you going to take the next step with any of these girls?
[09/10/2005 01:25 AM] ajw1293: i dunno
[09/10/2005 01:25 AM] ajw1293: i dont want to get into anything and find out i dont like them
[09/10/2005 01:25 AM] ajw1293: kinda like it was with jessie
[09/10/2005 01:25 AM] ajw1293: i didnt get to know her too well first
[09/10/2005 01:25 AM] Me: not neccissarily dating, just single them out more, make them feel special, and in the process you will get to know them better
[09/10/2005 01:26 AM] ajw1293: right
[09/10/2005 01:26 AM] ajw1293: like i'm doing with rachel
[09/10/2005 01:26 AM] Me: ask them to spend time with you, ask them seprately though
[09/10/2005 01:26 AM] Me: yes the #1 was a nice approach
[09/10/2005 01:27 AM] Me: now ask her to each lunch with you sometime, and then again the next week, get into a comfortable routine where she is the one, and she will open up more
[09/10/2005 01:27 AM] Me: that would be my approach
[09/10/2005 01:28 AM] ajw1293: yeah
[09/10/2005 01:28 AM] ajw1293: i had dinner with jackie the other night
[09/10/2005 01:28 AM] Me: perfect
[09/10/2005 01:29 AM] Me: she sounds cute
[09/10/2005 01:29 AM] ajw1293: see there's where my problem is
[09/10/2005 01:30 AM] ajw1293: i cant get too involved with one or i lose the other ones but if i keep with all of them then i never get too far with any one of them
[09/10/2005 01:34 AM] Me: play them all
[09/10/2005 01:35 AM] Me: don't let any of them get away from you
[09/10/2005 01:35 AM] ajw1293: but i dont want anything to get screwed up and them all end up hating me
[09/10/2005 01:35 AM] Me: even out the time
[09/10/2005 01:35 AM] Me: be honest
[09/10/2005 01:36 AM] Me: if you have to let them know you are seeing other people
[09/10/2005 01:37 AM] ajw1293: but then it cant get to serious
[09/10/2005 01:38 AM] Me: yeah
[09/10/2005 01:38 AM] Me: you just have to play off everything
[09/10/2005 01:38 AM] Me: sometimes
[09/10/2005 01:38 AM] Me: you can have something deep without obligation
[09/10/2005 01:39 AM] ajw1293: sometimes
