BrianJCullinan: thankx for the agua
BrianJCullinan: but it tasted like mexican water
Efoehn: its from costco 
BrianJCullinan: so i can get the mp3s back but a lot of the tags are messed up
Efoehn: how so 
BrianJCullinan: but i decided just to run the "Arrange Files" on all the files except the concert music
BrianJCullinan: and a lot of the sound tracks
BrianJCullinan: because it doesn't do those right because they have the artist after the name of the song
BrianJCullinan: the tags are messed up because they are blank
BrianJCullinan: they don't show any data for some reason
BrianJCullinan: it sux
BrianJCullinan: but the arrange files will fix almost everything except the soundtracls
BrianJCullinan: *tracks
