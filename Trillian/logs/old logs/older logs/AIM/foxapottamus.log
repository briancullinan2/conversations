[10/04/2005 12:18 AM] Fox: what do you mean?
[10/04/2005 12:18 AM] Me: you can only do different types of fire wire to firewire
[10/04/2005 12:18 AM] Me: there are different types of firewire so it may look like a usb though if you know it needs to convert to fire wire, then it is probably a firewire not usb
