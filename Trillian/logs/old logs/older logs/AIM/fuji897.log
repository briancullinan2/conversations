[06/14/2006 06:34 PM] Me: 9090
[06/14/2006 06:34 PM] Me: i want to redirect jsp files to port 9090
[06/14/2006 06:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so, whenever the header info is application/x-java you want to rewrite to port 9090
[06/14/2006 06:34 PM] Me: right now the header variable is returning blank
[06/14/2006 06:34 PM] Me: yes
[06/14/2006 06:35 PM] Me: wait i got it

[06/14/2006 06:36 PM] Me: yeah but the header is the hard thing to mod-rewrite
[06/14/2006 06:36 PM] Me: how do i get the header?
[06/14/2006 06:37 PM] Robert Douglas: you should post @ webmasterworld.com

[06/16/2006 01:26 PM] Me: what if
[06/16/2006 01:26 PM] Me: you made a crm that used sql completely
[06/16/2006 01:26 PM] Me: not mssql
[06/16/2006 01:27 PM] Me: then you could have PHP support
[06/16/2006 01:27 PM] Me: for a web browser interfacing
[06/16/2006 01:27 PM] Me: and application support
[06/16/2006 01:27 PM] Me: like.net and java has classes already built for using sql

[06/16/2006 01:47 PM] Me: its so amazing
[06/16/2006 01:47 PM] Robert Douglas: it will be very hard, unless you have someone to do the hardware, it is doubtful you could do anything
[06/16/2006 01:48 PM] Me: i am thinking of ways to do the hardware

[06/16/2006 01:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i like the nvidia ones better i think
[06/16/2006 01:49 PM] Robert Douglas: whatever you decide to get, boot into safe mode, uninstall all your drivers, and then run this in safe mode > (Link: http://www.drivercleaner.net)http://www.drivercleaner.net
[06/16/2006 01:50 PM] Robert Douglas: that will ensure your video drivers are clean before install

[06/22/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: it is the way php is ran
[06/22/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: normally it is an apache module
[06/22/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so it runs as nobody
[06/22/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: phpsuexec runs php scripts under your actual username
[06/22/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: so you use 0770 instead of 0777
[06/22/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: it helps security

[06/22/2006 02:43 PM] Me: maybe i can fade a texture
[06/22/2006 02:45 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[06/22/2006 02:45 PM] Robert Douglas: if u link me i can take a look and give u suggestion

[06/22/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: what are you using that on?
[06/22/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: what site
[06/22/2006 02:47 PM] Me: its on my vb.net application not a site
[06/22/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: ah
[06/22/2006 02:47 PM] Me: its for my home automation stuff
[06/22/2006 02:48 PM] Me: vb.net is so easy
[06/22/2006 02:48 PM] Me: i wrote and entire server/client communication system last night using System.Net.Socket
[06/22/2006 02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: ll i love vb.net
[06/22/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: i wrote the chemistry lab answer sheet using that
[06/22/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: you give it your input, such as the weights and times that you recorded, and it will do all the calculations automatically
[06/22/2006 02:50 PM] Me: yeah
[06/22/2006 02:50 PM] Me: isn't vb easy?
[06/22/2006 02:51 PM] Me: and asp is pretty easy also
[06/22/2006 02:51 PM] Me: its just the C# and VB merge with server side compiling like php
[06/22/2006 02:51 PM] Me: except its proprietary and you can't download the .net framework source code
[06/22/2006 02:51 PM] Me: fuckers
[06/22/2006 02:54 PM] Me: so i am trying to make this application as absolutely dynamic as possible
[06/22/2006 02:54 PM] Me: maybe even skinnable
[06/22/2006 02:54 PM] Me: which is not easy to do with vb.net
[06/22/2006 02:54 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah i've never done skins or things similar in vb.net
[06/22/2006 02:55 PM] Me: well sometimes it is, like you can do a self draw with all the windows form objects which is pretty amazing
[06/22/2006 02:55 PM] Me: like a manual draw for menus are popular
[06/22/2006 02:55 PM] Me: so i wrote a script that made the menus look like the microsoft office 2003 menus
[06/22/2006 02:55 PM] Me: pretty awesome
[06/22/2006 02:56 PM] Robert Douglas: that's nice

 pw: brian
 host: 72.34.41.112
[07/25/2006 09:50 PM] Me: i still don't understand why i should have to edit my host file to get to the right site
[07/25/2006 09:51 PM] Robert Douglas: because the DNS isn't setup for that domain name
[07/25/2006 09:51 PM] Me: then use a different domain name until you go live
[07/25/2006 09:51 PM] Robert Douglas: so when your ISP goes to find out the IP to assign for that domain, it doesnt find the correct IP
[07/25/2006 09:51 PM] Robert Douglas: changing the domain name of an account requires you to re-create the ENTIRE account in WHM
[07/25/2006 09:52 PM] Robert Douglas: you can access it via the server IP and username,such as: (Link: http://72.34.41.112/~botnick/)http://72.34.41.112/~botnick/ however it doesn't work when you are using certain paths, such as including a file by /filename.css instead of filename.css
[07/25/2006 09:55 PM] Robert Douglas: you can login via (Link: http://72.34.41.112/~botnick/Admin/)http://72.34.41.112/~botnick/Admin/ however, lots of stuff will not display becauseof the way it is being called

[07/25/2006 09:59 PM] Robert Douglas: still acts the same for me
[07/25/2006 09:59 PM] Robert Douglas: Staff Bios is the page with the issue
[07/25/2006 09:59 PM] Me: that's the one i changed

[07/25/2006 10:00 PM] Me: clear your cache?
[07/25/2006 10:00 PM] Robert Douglas: still doesnt work for me
[07/25/2006 10:02 PM] Me: works for me
[07/25/2006 10:02 PM] Me: hard to tell with all those extra ones
[07/25/2006 10:03 PM] Me: well?
[07/25/2006 10:03 PM] Robert Douglas: i'll log out and back in
[07/25/2006 10:03 PM] Me: its working
[07/25/2006 10:04 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, it still does it, just tried it in IE (never logged in before using IE)
[07/25/2006 10:04 PM] Me: move down an item and the description matches names
[07/25/2006 10:04 PM] Me: what does logging in have to do with the staff bios page?
[07/25/2006 10:04 PM] Robert Douglas: ok, it works when it is moved down, but not moved up
[07/25/2006 10:05 PM] Robert Douglas: i figured it might be some sort of a cache issue, because you said it works, and i tried it and it didnt
[07/25/2006 10:05 PM] Me: i didn't try up
[07/25/2006 10:05 PM] Me: the down works
[07/25/2006 10:05 PM] Robert Douglas: you only fixed it for when it moves down, but it messes up when it moves up as well
[07/25/2006 10:05 PM] Me: oh i thought you said that part worked
[07/25/2006 10:06 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, didnt work both ways
[07/25/2006 10:07 PM] Me: now your getting it confused with the messed up ones
[07/25/2006 10:07 PM] Me: i found the same error in the up code also
[07/25/2006 10:07 PM] Robert Douglas: confused? how?

[07/25/2006 10:09 PM] Me: glad to be of assistance sorry i didn't catch that sooner
[07/25/2006 10:09 PM] Me: what happened to your css styles?
[07/25/2006 10:09 PM] Robert Douglas: np, what was the issue?
[07/25/2006 10:10 PM] Me: i loaded the from and to positions to an array
[07/25/2006 10:10 PM] Robert Douglas: nothing happened to it, when you access the website using (Link: http://ip/~username/)http://ip/~username/ the css file is still caleld by "/styles.css" so it looks for it in the http:/ip/ directory, instead of the (Link: http://ip/~username/)http://ip/~username/ directory, meaning it doesn't display
[07/25/2006 10:10 PM] Me: and the 4th and 5th property referred to the from array instead of the to array
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Me: oh
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Robert Douglas: that's why i setup a hosts file for the domain
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Me: why not just use a preceeding / in the html
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Robert Douglas: i'm going to see if there is some sort of port forwarding we can do on the server, because it is a pain int he ass to mess with host files
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Me: yes it is
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Robert Douglas: it has a preceeding /
[07/25/2006 10:11 PM] Me: hm

[07/25/2006 10:12 PM] Robert Douglas: the 1st one that usest he server IP, looks like botnick is an actual folder, that;s why it doesn't display when you use a /

[07/26/2006 02:11 PM] Robert Douglas: Yeah, another problem was reported. Pretty sure this is the last one.
[07/26/2006 02:11 PM] Robert Douglas: When you upload an image for a staff member and press save, it saves it and all is well. But then when you edit the description of the staff member, for example..., and press save, the uploaded image is disabled and is no longer uploaded. Basically you need to reupload the image every time someone makes a change. Can we have it so that when someone uploads an image, it is there until a new image is uploaded.
[07/26/2006 02:12 PM] Me: yeah
[07/26/2006 02:12 PM] Me: did you make any more changes to that page?
[07/26/2006 02:12 PM] Robert Douglas: going to make one in a sec

[07/26/2006 02:17 PM] Robert Douglas: if( $_FILES['picture' . $id]['tmp_name'] != "" )
[07/26/2006 02:17 PM] Robert Douglas: gotcha
[07/26/2006 02:17 PM] Me: yes
[07/26/2006 02:18 PM] Me: but then i need 2 sql statements
[07/26/2006 02:18 PM] Me: because it still update the picture path
[07/26/2006 02:18 PM] Robert Douglas: but "if( $_FILES['picture' . $id]['tmp_name'] != "" )" should work
[07/26/2006 02:18 PM] Me: yeah that's for the ftp into
[07/26/2006 02:18 PM] Me: but you still want to save the other stuff
[07/26/2006 02:19 PM] Me: so i will make saving the picture path to the sql database 1 query, then saving everything regardless of picture path a separate query
[07/26/2006 02:20 PM] Robert Douglas: sounds like a good idea
[07/26/2006 02:23 PM] Me: i think that should take care of it
[07/26/2006 02:23 PM] Me: i'm going to upload now
[07/26/2006 02:23 PM] Robert Douglas: k 
[07/26/2006 02:26 PM] Me: hmm strange
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Me: doesn't seem to upload at all now
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: ?
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Robert Douglas: doesnt upload the image when you click save?
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Me: no
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Me: ah maybe its just too big
[07/26/2006 02:27 PM] Me: because it saves the locations
[07/26/2006 02:28 PM] Me: there we go
[07/26/2006 02:28 PM] Me: click save again and no change to the image
[07/26/2006 02:29 PM] Me: let me know if you have anymore problems
[07/26/2006 02:29 PM] Me: and remind me if you change it
[07/26/2006 02:29 PM] Me: how about only displaying an image element if there is actually an image?
[07/26/2006 02:30 PM] Robert Douglas: everyone will have animage
[07/26/2006 02:30 PM] Me: ok
[07/26/2006 02:30 PM] Robert Douglas: it will be [No PHOTO] image, or it will be their image
[07/26/2006 02:30 PM] Robert Douglas: grabbing animage now to test it all
[07/26/2006 02:30 PM] Me: ah
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Me: dude, my friend dave wrote a java app that gets the address of all your myspace friends
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: awesome bro, works perfectly
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Me: its pretty sweet
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: was he in our java class?
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Me: i think it uses mapquest engine
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Me: no but hes really into java
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Me: hes writes struts for the university
[07/26/2006 02:32 PM] Robert Douglas: that's cool
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: java is awesome, if uknow it well
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: i don't know where kids get these jobs all the university sites are fucking asp
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: damn asp
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: i hate it
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: i agree
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: no open source
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: i looked at SugarCRM some more
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: that looks sexy
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Robert Douglas: it is so sexy
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: i might download and play around with the source
[07/26/2006 02:33 PM] Me: is it well organized?
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: i figured out a way to not have to developers/specialists put that gay host information inside their hosts file
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: aparently when you use ports, apache handles it differently, and can fuck up easier
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: restarts and whatnot
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Me: yeah
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so we cant use port forwarding
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: but we can use a temporary dedicated IP
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Me: apache fucks up with ports?
[07/26/2006 02:34 PM] Robert Douglas: so we will put thedeveloping website on its own IP address, and it should work then
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: port forwarding with cpanel/whm, yes
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: not in general
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Me: oh ok
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: sugar is well organized
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Me: sweet
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: we love it, it is awesome
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Me: have you ever heard of Media Portal or Medio?
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: spent about an hour playing around with it, thinking about its logic
[07/26/2006 02:35 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Me: its open source media center, like the windows media center, but more expandable
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Robert Douglas: after taking that time to mess with it, it seems like it is organized awesome
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Robert Douglas: nice, i just install WMP11
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Robert Douglas: installed*
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Me: well Medio sold to yahoo so its pwned now, but Media Portal has some beautiful source code
[07/26/2006 02:36 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.team-mediaportal.com/)http://www.team-mediaportal.com/ ?
[07/26/2006 02:37 PM] Me: the GUI is written in directX, i mean even when you first open it you can tell by the 20 different properly labels projects in the navigation panel that it is well organized
[07/26/2006 02:37 PM] Me: yes that is it
[07/26/2006 02:37 PM] Me: its written in C#
[07/26/2006 02:37 PM] Me: its absolutely beautiful
[07/26/2006 02:38 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah the screenshots are badass
[07/26/2006 02:38 PM] Robert Douglas: how's your music server app going?
[07/26/2006 02:38 PM] Me: i am thinking about using that for my home automation system and just adding in a lighting section to control the x10 stuff
[07/26/2006 02:38 PM] Me: its going well
[07/26/2006 02:39 PM] Robert Douglas: all of our power went out last night, my sexy UPS kept my computer running lol
[07/26/2006 02:39 PM] Robert Douglas: have you started the home automation stuff yet?
[07/26/2006 02:39 PM] Me: yeah i started building my own server client stuff
[07/26/2006 02:40 PM] Me: but the skinning classes are what matter most to my dad, and i tried writing my own
[07/26/2006 02:40 PM] Me: that's right, i wrote my own skinning classes in VB
[07/26/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: do u need someone who know electrical?
[07/26/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: lol
[07/26/2006 02:41 PM] Me: it is a pretty nice concept and well organized, but the special effects on it are slow and take up lots of CPU mostly because of the .Net framework having an inefficient drawing class
[07/26/2006 02:41 PM] Me: large and feature rich that the drawing class may be, its still too big
[07/26/2006 02:42 PM] Me: this Media Portal thing is beautiful, i can event enter an FTP address for a music library and it will download the songs right off my server, complete with a percent status indicator
[07/26/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: lol that is sweet
[07/26/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: reminds me of OurTunes
[07/26/2006 02:44 PM] Me: yeah, so maybe if i just add on a My Lighting section, and replace the windows shell with a batch file on a little tablet PC that will be suitable enough for him
[07/26/2006 02:44 PM] Robert Douglas: are u building this for him as a project for him? or just for fun?
[07/26/2006 02:44 PM] Me: a project for him
[07/26/2006 02:44 PM] Me: he wants home automation
[07/26/2006 02:44 PM] Me: and i couldn't get my infrared system to work
[07/26/2006 02:45 PM] Me: but lighting i know will work
[07/26/2006 02:45 PM] Me: i think i am going to pirate Visual Studio Team System just cause i can
[07/26/2006 02:45 PM] Me: (Link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/default.aspx)http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/(Link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/default.aspx)default.aspx
[07/26/2006 02:46 PM] Robert Douglas: that package has like 6 CDs
[07/26/2006 02:47 PM] Me: yeah i know isn't it great?
[07/26/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: haha yeah
[07/26/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: btw, AMD is slashing up to 55% off their X2 cpus
[07/26/2006 02:47 PM] Me: i'll like give them out to friends with the jobs i think they should be doing for my company that doesn't exist
[07/26/2006 02:47 PM] Robert Douglas: if you feel like upgrading
[07/26/2006 02:48 PM] Me: yeah i just ordered a new motherboard today
[07/26/2006 02:48 PM] Me: i am going to build a Gentoo system
[07/26/2006 02:48 PM] Robert Douglas: have you seen the new conroe chips?
[07/26/2006 02:48 PM] Me: no
[07/26/2006 02:48 PM] Me: is that the AM2?
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: nope, the new Intel, blows AMD out of the fucking water
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Me: damnit
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Me: i'm still sticking with AMD
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: dude, this is HUGE.... Intel is now BETTER than AMD
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Me: they will catch up
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Me: no, i like the AMD logic
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: they are SO much better, that the new AM2 chips will most likely not even be able to compete with the current Intel chips
[07/26/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: either way, i got my 4400+ for like $550, it is down to $220 now
[07/26/2006 02:50 PM] Me: yeah i saw that
[07/26/2006 02:50 PM] Me: the 4200+ are still 300 bucks though
[07/26/2006 02:50 PM] Me: fuck that
[07/26/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[07/26/2006 02:51 PM] Me: zipzoomfly.com
[07/26/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: $188.49
[07/26/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.mwave.com/mwave/ViewProducts.hmx?PID=CPU-A64X2AM2&updepts=CPU&DNAME=Processors+%2D+CPU)http://www.mwave.com/mwave/ViewProducts.hmx?PID=CPU-A64X2AM2&updepts=CPU&DNAME=Processors+%2D+CPU---
[07/26/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: x2 4200 is only 182 fucking dolars
[07/26/2006 02:51 PM] Me: yeah that is pretty nice
[07/26/2006 02:52 PM] Me: so what does intel have over AMD
[07/26/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: even at that price, the conroe chips are still better price/performance than amd
[07/26/2006 02:52 PM] Me: what speed are they claiming?
[07/26/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: (Link: http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2795)http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2795
[07/26/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: they overclock much better than AMD too
[07/26/2006 02:53 PM] Robert Douglas: one guy was getting a 2.93 to 4ghz on air
[07/26/2006 02:53 PM] Robert Douglas: huge amouns of cache
[07/26/2006 02:53 PM] * Me still sticking with AMD
[07/26/2006 02:54 PM] Robert Douglas: i will for now, but if i was building a new computer, i think i would take a 4MB cache cpu that blows any AMD cpu away for $500
[07/26/2006 02:54 PM] Me: hears x386 logic
 
[07/26/2006 02:54 PM] Me: damnit
[07/26/2006 02:55 PM] Me: here's AmD64 logic
 here's x386 logic
[07/26/2006 02:55 PM] Robert Douglas: lool what?
[07/26/2006 02:55 PM] Robert Douglas: brb 2 min
[07/26/2006 02:55 PM] Me: AMD is on top

[07/26/2006 04:09 PM] Me: yeah?
[07/26/2006 04:10 PM] Robert Douglas: for the image upload area, it would be better to have the name of theimage load inside the input box, that way ppl know what the image is that is associated with the picture, just in case it needs ot be updated and whatnot
[07/26/2006 04:11 PM] Me: can't change that input box
[07/26/2006 04:11 PM] Me: tried that
[07/26/2006 04:12 PM] Robert Douglas: why?
[07/26/2006 04:12 PM] Me: its weird i don't know you can't change the input text for a browse file field
[07/26/2006 04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: hmmm
[07/26/2006 04:13 PM] Robert Douglas: that is very weird
[07/26/2006 04:14 PM] Robert Douglas: here's a better idea
[07/26/2006 04:14 PM] Robert Douglas: have text appear below in bold
 Current image: image-name.jpg
[07/26/2006 04:14 PM] Robert Douglas: that will also do it

[08/16/2006 02:34 PM] Me: 4200+

[08/16/2006 02:35 PM] Me: no server board or anything

[08/16/2006 02:39 PM] Me: 80 bucks per hard drive
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Me: 32 cents per gig
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: for each $500/gb?
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Me: plus a new motherboard
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: 500gb*
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: where the fuck did you get a 500gb drive for $80
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Me: i spent about $500 on all the extra stuff i needed to complete the second system
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Me: no 250GB for 80
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Me: $80
[08/16/2006 02:40 PM] Robert Douglas: ooooh
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Me: 32 cents per gig
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Me: i bought 4 x 250
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Robert Douglas: i could have got you a 320gb for $10 more
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Me: yeah i saw that
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Me: but i bought an extra 4 port controller
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Robert Douglas: ah nice
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Me: so i should have no problem expanding
[08/16/2006 02:41 PM] Robert Douglas: hardware raid?
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Me: no my fucking mobo doesn't have it, pissed me off
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Me: so linux software raid, its still very efficient
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Me: it will do for now
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Robert Douglas: aww
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Robert Douglas: shitty
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Me: yeah a little bit
[08/16/2006 02:42 PM] Me: but linux raid is ok
[08/16/2006 02:43 PM] Me: actually i kind of like it better because i can view info about it and manage partitions really easily from within the OS
[08/16/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: i just hear horror stories about software raid
[08/16/2006 02:43 PM] Me: OS being from the command line or X windows interface
[08/16/2006 02:43 PM] Robert Douglas: what happens if the software is currupt
[08/16/2006 02:44 PM] Me: nah, not linux software raid, its one of the most stable ones out there
[08/16/2006 02:44 PM] Me: and if files get corrupt there are all kinds of fixing tools for it
[08/16/2006 02:45 PM] Me: and i can just take the drive off through the command line and use the other one
[08/16/2006 02:45 PM] Me: i am waiting for my shipment for my last 2 drives, its making me crazy
[08/16/2006 02:46 PM] Me: it says out for delivery, i'm going nutw
[08/16/2006 02:46 PM] Me: s
[08/16/2006 02:46 PM] Me: *nuts
[08/16/2006 02:49 PM] Robert Douglas: lmao
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: sometimes i call those fuckers and make sure they come on time
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Me: yeah?
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: i met one fedex guy out like 2 miles away from my house once
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: all fedex/ups guys work in the same area
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Robert Douglas: so most likely the guy is like 10 mins of less from your hours
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Me: yeah
[08/16/2006 02:50 PM] Me: what he going to deliver tomorrow?
[08/16/2006 02:51 PM] Me: or just wait until later?
[08/16/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: i called them, and was like "io have a comptuer that was supposed to ship out last week, and we have a custom ordered part arriving today, we would like to have this out as soon as possible, would we be able to meet the delivery driver somewhere?"
[08/16/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: that's basically what i said
[08/16/2006 02:51 PM] Me: cool
[08/16/2006 02:51 PM] Robert Douglas: so i met the guy 2 miles away from my house
[08/16/2006 02:52 PM] Robert Douglas: and picked up a box of my sata cables lol
[08/16/2006 02:52 PM] Me: cool
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Robert Douglas: did i tell you about that quad core amd cpu.mb for <$1000?
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Me: no
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Me: is it on newegg
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Robert Douglas: nope
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Me: have you seen intels new duo 2?
[08/16/2006 02:58 PM] Robert Douglas: AMD is going to come out with it
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: it is going to be the speed of the mid-high end fx chips
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah, they are the conroes, i told you how intel blows AMD out of the water
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Me: yeah sucks
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Me: when will AMD catch up?
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: they RAPE AMD
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Robert Douglas: AMD will catchup in 2009 when they release their new line
[08/16/2006 02:59 PM] Me: really?
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: yup
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: that far away
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Me: i don't want to wait that long
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: however, AMD is going to drop prices some more
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Me: when will ATI catch up to geforce
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Me: ?
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: Intel is the way to go with now
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: dunno, ATI sucks ass, and their support is a pain
[08/16/2006 03:00 PM] Robert Douglas: i hate ATI with a passion
[08/16/2006 03:01 PM] Me: why?
[08/16/2006 03:01 PM] Me: i like ATI
[08/16/2006 03:01 PM] Me: :-(
[08/16/2006 03:01 PM] Robert Douglas: their support service is so bad
[08/16/2006 03:02 PM] Robert Douglas: i called them and they hung up on me, and didnt give a shit
[08/16/2006 03:02 PM] Robert Douglas: BFG and eVga cards are the best to go with

[08/18/2006 10:29 PM] Me: you wouldn't happen to have any experience with linux pptp severs with windows vpn clients would you?
[08/18/2006 10:31 PM] Robert Douglas: a little
[08/18/2006 10:31 PM] Robert Douglas: open vpn is the shiat
[08/18/2006 10:34 PM] Me: yeah but its just as hard to install and configure a server as openswan or openpptp
[08/18/2006 10:35 PM] Robert Douglas: pptp is the best one
[08/18/2006 10:36 PM] Robert Douglas: as most firewalls will support it
[08/18/2006 10:36 PM] Me: not the Fedora one
[08/18/2006 10:37 PM] Me: i had to modify the iptables manually for the GRE
[08/18/2006 10:37 PM] Me: and i still can't get it to work
[08/18/2006 10:38 PM] Robert Douglas: try openvpn
[08/18/2006 10:38 PM] Me: i think that's the one i was working on
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Robert Douglas: what's your .ovpn config look like
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Me: i am waiting for my friend Dave to respond, hes a linux Guru
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Me: maybe not
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Me: i never saw a tutorial using that filename
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Me: i will have to try it
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Robert Douglas: you need a config file for the vpn to run
[08/18/2006 10:39 PM] Me: i was use pptp and wmme
[08/18/2006 10:40 PM] Robert Douglas: got o OpenVPN\config
[08/18/2006 10:40 PM] Robert Douglas: look for a .ovpn file
[08/18/2006 10:40 PM] Me: yeah i have a /etc/pptpd.conf and /etc/ppp/options.pptpd
[08/18/2006 10:40 PM] Me: ok
[08/18/2006 10:41 PM] Robert Douglas: sare u using tun?
[08/18/2006 10:41 PM] Me: maybe not
[08/18/2006 10:41 PM] Me: i will try to get openVPN working
[08/18/2006 10:42 PM] Me: using an x86_64 system complicates things a little with less support
[08/18/2006 10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: you'll need to figure out of you are going to use dev un or dev tap
[08/18/2006 10:42 PM] Robert Douglas: tap uses the ethernet P, and tun uses the IP P
[08/18/2006 10:43 PM] Me: ok
[08/18/2006 10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: tun is what i use on my server
[08/18/2006 10:43 PM] Robert Douglas: apparently it is more reliable
[08/18/2006 10:44 PM] Me: you will have to show me when i get back to school, i think you'll be somewhere impressed with my new setup, compared to my old setup
[08/18/2006 10:44 PM] Robert Douglas: actually, i'm going to ASU
[08/18/2006 10:44 PM] Me: seriously?
[08/18/2006 10:44 PM] Me: why?
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: i got tired of all the NAU bullshit
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: their techs are total idiots
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: banning me for reporting a spoof paypal email, wtf is that
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Me: you mean resnet?
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Me: yeah that's fucked up
[08/18/2006 10:45 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah
[08/18/2006 10:46 PM] Me: i don't think that will be any different at ASU
[08/18/2006 10:46 PM] Robert Douglas: yeah it will, i can live at home at ASU
[08/18/2006 10:49 PM] Me: yeah
