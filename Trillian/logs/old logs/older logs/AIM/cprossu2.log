[07/18/2005 05:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: what's up-make it fast
[07/18/2005 05:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: have to get back to my experiment
[07/18/2005 05:22 PM] Me: when is the ati going to be out?
[07/18/2005 05:22 PM] Me: the x800xl?
[07/18/2005 05:23 PM] Me: and can you get me a seagate 500gb 7200.9?
[07/18/2005 05:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: um wait about 2 mounths, and no on the seagate atm
[07/18/2005 05:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: *months
[07/18/2005 05:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: sorry my typing has been off all day
[07/18/2005 05:23 PM] Me: can't you get me one now?
[07/18/2005 05:24 PM] Me: and the ati is advertising their new x800XL all in wonder but i can't find them anywhere
[07/18/2005 05:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: eh-nv and ati both do that
[07/18/2005 05:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: wait 2 months
[07/18/2005 05:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it should be readily available
[07/18/2005 05:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: the seagates will show up within a month
[07/18/2005 05:25 PM] Nerd Andrew: but will be fairly expensive -although as a result of this the 400gb'ers will be cheaper!
[07/18/2005 05:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol if I told you what I am going to order next week it'd make you faint
[07/18/2005 05:26 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Me: can't you get me any of this stuff?
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: one of my friends is having me build their dad a workstation
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Me: are you ordering a server?  optical drives?
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: not unless you want to pay through the nose
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Me: can you get a seagate 7200.9?
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: it starts out with a pair of opteron 275's, and 4gb of ram
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: lol
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Nerd Andrew: yes-
[07/18/2005 05:27 PM] Me: how?
[07/18/2005 05:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: it's called paying $1 grand 
[07/18/2005 05:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: or ordering the 500gb external
[07/18/2005 05:28 PM] Nerd Andrew: and taking it from it
[07/18/2005 05:28 PM] Me: nvm i don't want to spend that much

[08/10/2005 09:05 PM] Me: and doesn't shutting off the hard drive in sleep and hibernation bad for them?
[08/10/2005 09:11 PM] Me: my laptop CD drive is making a little bit of a rumble when it reads that i never noticed before, is that a bad sign?
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Nerd Andrew: eh-
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: your cd drive is fine
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: they all sound that way

[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: i've never seen a laptop bite the big one on cars or planes unless for an instance
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: they are dropped from an overhead compartment
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Nerd Andrew: hibernation is fine

[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Me: thanks
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Me: one more questions
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: laptop drives are built differently and don't have to endure the same torques as desktop drives
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: (ei the platter is smaller mass)
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Me: yeah
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Me: about audio
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Nerd Andrew: k\
[08/10/2005 09:20 PM] Me: is all the different signals passed through a regular analog output?
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: depends on the equipment
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: and what we are talking about
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Me: i mean like the left, right, front, rear, bass, center
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Me: would all of that go through on the regular speaker output?
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you use all the connections then it's all analogue
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: if you use 1 connection for all of em
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: then it's digital
[08/10/2005 09:21 PM] Me: ok
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: and it becomes analogue when it gets to the wires leading to the speaker from the decoder if it is digital
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: anything else?
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Me: because i want to send that to a receiver but will the receiver be able to divide up the 1 signal into surround sound?
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: make sure to either use the coax digital out
[08/10/2005 09:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: or a optical one
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Me: hmmm
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Me: i think i have those on the asus
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: I have to reboot since I just bought a new UPS and need to hook it up
[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Me: nice

[08/10/2005 09:23 PM] Nerd Andrew: anything else
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] Nerd Andrew: because I will goto sleep after that lol

[08/11/2005 10:21 PM] Nerd Andrew: lets just say the effects will be undesireable
[08/11/2005 10:21 PM] Me: lol yeah
[08/11/2005 10:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: that feature was more meant for "external sata devices"
[08/11/2005 10:22 PM] Nerd Andrew: since you can buy a little faceplate which you can route the sata connections to
