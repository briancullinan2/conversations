[09/22/2005 01:58 PM] Mom: i just got home, I am sorry you are sad, it will work out
[09/22/2005 01:58 PM] Me: no it won't
[09/22/2005 01:58 PM] Me: everything that could possibly be wrong is still going to be expensive to replace
[09/22/2005 01:59 PM] Me: i am getting a refurbished hard drive for a replacement
[09/22/2005 01:59 PM] Mom: I don't understand how these things are bad
[09/22/2005 01:59 PM] Me: you know how shitty that is?  that means that someone already bought the hard drive, had problems with it, and sent it back to the company to be fixed
[09/22/2005 01:59 PM] Me: that is the replacement i am getting
[09/22/2005 02:00 PM] Me: now my motherboard won't post, which probably means something is fried
[09/22/2005 02:00 PM] Mom: yea
[09/22/2005 02:00 PM] Me: so either my 80 dollar power supply is bad, my 120 dollar motherboard is bad, my 525 dollar processor is bad
[09/22/2005 02:00 PM] Me: any one of those things
[09/22/2005 02:00 PM] Mom: you and dad will figure it out
[09/22/2005 02:01 PM] Me: that doesn't mean i am not going to have to spend more money to fix it
[09/22/2005 02:01 PM] Me: i spent 1600 dollars on this damn computer and nothing works
[09/22/2005 02:01 PM] Mom: I understand, it sucks
[09/22/2005 02:02 PM] Me: i can't even ask you to buy something for a birthday or christmas present because it is all to expensive
[09/22/2005 02:02 PM] Mom: honey, we will help out
[09/22/2005 02:03 PM] Me: this is enough problems to either change my major or make me want to buy Mac from now on
[09/22/2005 02:03 PM] Mom: LOL
[09/22/2005 02:03 PM] Mom: you are not buying a MAC
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Me: i am seriously doubting whether or not i want to change my major so i can stop putting up with all this shit
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Mom: You gotta calm down or I know what will happen to you
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Me: what will happen?
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Mom: You won't give a damn about anything until it is fixed
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Me: i just blew my graduation money on a piece of shit
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Me: it is worthless now
[09/22/2005 02:04 PM] Me: nothing on it works
[09/22/2005 02:05 PM] Mom: turn it off, use your laptop and know that it will get figured out before the weeknd is over
[09/22/2005 02:05 PM] Me: yeah where are we going to come up with the money to fix it?
[09/22/2005 02:05 PM] Me: i would never ask you for this much money that it will take to fix it
[09/22/2005 02:05 PM] Mom: maybe it is not as bad as you think
[09/22/2005 02:05 PM] Mom: dad is good at this stuff
[09/22/2005 02:06 PM] Me: even if i do send everything back and replace everything i will still have to wait at least 2 more weeks before i get a response
[09/22/2005 02:06 PM] Mom: did you and your dad work out a plan for room and board
[09/22/2005 02:06 PM] Me: besides all that i want a new case, this is the hardest case to get into and i don't want to deal with it anymore
[09/22/2005 02:06 PM] Me: no
[09/22/2005 02:07 PM] Me: he hasn't reimbursed me
[09/22/2005 02:07 PM] Mom: will he?
[09/22/2005 02:07 PM] Me: and i probably won't see any money until after the holiday season at least
