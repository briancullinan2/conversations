[08/10/2005 09:00 PM] Me: hey
[08/10/2005 09:00 PM] EricGFoehner: HI
[08/10/2005 09:01 PM] Me: i might be able to get us a reciever
[08/10/2005 09:01 PM] EricGFoehner: how
[08/10/2005 09:01 PM] Me: then we could hook everything up to it like our computers and the dvd player and the other tv and anything else we have
[08/10/2005 09:02 PM] Me: my dad might have a spare
[08/10/2005 09:02 PM] EricGFoehner: really 
[08/10/2005 09:02 PM] Me: are your surround sound speakers analog or composite?
[08/10/2005 09:03 PM] EricGFoehner: ?
[08/10/2005 09:03 PM] Me: headphone jack or red and white (L and R)?
[08/10/2005 09:04 PM] EricGFoehner: the speakers connect to the unit by the red and black wires that clip into the little things 
[08/10/2005 09:06 PM] Me: oh
[08/10/2005 09:06 PM] Me: i think that is what we need
[08/10/2005 09:07 PM] Me: maybe your DVD player could act like a reciever
[08/10/2005 09:07 PM] Me: does it have lots of inputs?
[08/10/2005 09:07 PM] EricGFoehner: no
[08/10/2005 09:07 PM] EricGFoehner: only 1 i think 
[08/10/2005 09:09 PM] Me: ok
[08/10/2005 09:09 PM] Me: then yeah we will need a receiver
[08/10/2005 09:11 PM] Me: i will see if i can acquire one soon
[08/10/2005 09:12 PM] Me: if my dad has a spare its still probably really nice
[08/10/2005 09:12 PM] EricGFoehner: so what exactly will it do? 
[08/10/2005 09:13 PM] Me: all of our different inputs will go into it
[08/10/2005 09:13 PM] Me: and then output it into the surround sound
[08/10/2005 09:13 PM] EricGFoehner: oh 
[08/10/2005 09:14 PM] Me: the alternative would be give me the surround sound and i plug it into my 8 channel audio and we play DVDs on my computer
[08/10/2005 09:14 PM] Me: which looks really awesome by the way you should see it
[08/10/2005 09:14 PM] Me: i was getting way over 200 frames per second on quake 3
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] EricGFoehner: that might be the way to go, my dvd player is picky 
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] Me: when i used to only get about 70
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] EricGFoehner: it sucks it other words 
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] Me: really how so?
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] EricGFoehner: it doesn't play some dvds 
[08/10/2005 09:15 PM] Me: hmmm
[08/10/2005 09:16 PM] Me: well the only problem with that is we won't be able to use it for other stuff
[08/10/2005 09:16 PM] Me: and we will have to convert all the ends of the wires to analog or composite
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] EricGFoehner: is there a way we could change it when we needed it for different applications 
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] Me: yeah not sure
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] Me: my thinking is we would have our regular computer speakers
[08/10/2005 09:17 PM] Me: just the two or three on the side
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] Me: then we would also send that signal to the reciever
[08/10/2005 09:18 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[08/10/2005 09:19 PM] Me: and with the receiver we would have all those extra inputs
[08/10/2005 09:24 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[08/10/2005 09:37 PM] *** You have been disconnected. Wed Aug 10 21:37:33 2005.

Session Start (BrianJCullinan:EricGFoehner): Sat Aug 13 15:33:20 2005
[08/13/2005 03:33 PM] Me: Eric!
[08/13/2005 03:33 PM] EricGFoehner: yeah 
[08/13/2005 03:34 PM] Me: i found a sony reciever with coaxial and optical input along with 2 other inputs and a 5.1 speaker set for $200
[08/13/2005 03:34 PM] Me: you realize that eventually we will be moving into an apartment or possible apart
[08/13/2005 03:34 PM] Me: therefore whoever wants the speaker could just fill in the other half and take it
[08/13/2005 03:34 PM] EricGFoehner: ok
[08/13/2005 03:35 PM] Me: so if we split it now and you want it someday then just pay me the other half and its yurs
[08/13/2005 03:35 PM] Me: and you know sony is always more expensive then the normal, so i am posative this is quality stuff
[08/13/2005 03:35 PM] EricGFoehner: do you have a link? 
[08/13/2005 03:36 PM] Me: yeah
[08/13/2005 03:37 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=158HTDW670)http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-b(Link: http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=158HTDW670)in/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=158HTDW670
[08/13/2005 03:37 PM] Me: the only bad thing is there is only 2 audio inputs
[08/13/2005 03:37 PM] Me: we might want more then that
[08/13/2005 03:38 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=580HTS580S)http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-b(Link: http://www.crutchfield.com/S-pjv7bJ548J3/cgi-bin/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=580HTS580S)in/ProdView.asp?g=37600&I=580HTS580S
[08/13/2005 03:38 PM] Me: this one would be better
[08/13/2005 03:39 PM] EricGFoehner: $300?

[08/13/2005 03:40 PM] Me: that is best
[08/13/2005 03:40 PM] Me: wow
[08/13/2005 03:40 PM] Me: this thing is beastly
[08/13/2005 03:40 PM] Me: that's it right there
[08/13/2005 03:40 PM] Me: i'm tempted to order it now
[08/13/2005 03:41 PM] Me: for 175
[08/13/2005 03:41 PM] Me: it has 2 inputs for video switching AKA both of our computer on TV
[08/13/2005 03:41 PM] Me: 2 audio, 4 av
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] Me: 5.1 surround input, that's the good shit
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] EricGFoehner: so we would hook both of our puters up to it?
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] Me: 2 sets of main speaker outputs
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] Me: yes
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] Me: and more
[08/13/2005 03:42 PM] Me: we could hook your DVD player surround sound up to it
[08/13/2005 03:43 PM] EricGFoehner: and we wouldn't need the dvd unit itself? 
[08/13/2005 03:43 PM] Me: no we would still use the DVD player
[08/13/2005 03:43 PM] Me: but we would still get surround sound from the dvd player
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: and from my computer
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] EricGFoehner: what about the dvd players on the computers 
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: and from yours if you have it
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: yeah we could still use all of that
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] EricGFoehner: well like i told you my dvd player sucks 
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: with the other one we could only get surround sound from either my computer OR the DVD player
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: but how are your speakers?
[08/13/2005 03:44 PM] Me: do we need new speakers?
[08/13/2005 03:45 PM] EricGFoehner: the speakers are good 
[08/13/2005 03:45 PM] EricGFoehner: i think

[10/13/2005 10:39 AM] EricGFoehner: you made her?
[10/13/2005 10:39 AM] Me: she probably could have just as easily found someone else with a graphing calculator
[10/13/2005 10:39 AM] Me: i should have gone over there and taken it to her
[10/13/2005 10:39 AM] Me: so i kind of made her
[10/13/2005 10:39 AM] EricGFoehner: oh

[10/13/2005 10:42 AM] Me: (Link: http://www.modelsall.com)http://www.modelsall.com

[10/13/2005 10:45 AM] Me: then again it was probably a growing problem because my computer froze even before i moved it up here

[10/17/2005 08:50 AM] Me: what time did jessie have class?
[10/17/2005 08:50 AM] EricGFoehner: i don't know 
[10/17/2005 08:50 AM] Me: always follow up
[10/17/2005 08:50 AM] EricGFoehner: ?
[10/17/2005 08:50 AM] Me: its something we've never really talked about
[10/17/2005 08:51 AM] EricGFoehner: what are you talking about?
[10/17/2005 08:51 AM] Me: it is very important that you follow up, when the girl leaves you always need to call her later and tell her that you really enjoyed being around her and you hope to spend more time with her soon
[10/17/2005 08:51 AM] Me: something along those lines
[10/17/2005 08:51 AM] EricGFoehner: ok
[10/17/2005 08:51 AM] EricGFoehner: she said she would call me later 
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] Me: so you should probably call her later since her phone is charged and you can also ask her about her schedule
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] EricGFoehner: and i told her that i enjoyed having her stay the night 
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] EricGFoehner: not last night, but the night before 
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] Me: even if they say they will call later, it usually means that you should call her latter
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] EricGFoehner: ok
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] EricGFoehner: well i have to go to chemistry now 
[10/17/2005 08:52 AM] Me: ok
