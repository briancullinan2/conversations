[10/14/2005 11:00 AM] Me: before you started showing interest in him, he wouldn't even look at another girl, i know because he argues with brianna about it, and in turn fought with me about it
[10/14/2005 11:01 AM] Me: its his first girlfriend
[10/14/2005 11:01 AM] Me: and her second boyfriend
[10/14/2005 11:01 AM] Me: they don't know how or when to break it off
[10/14/2005 11:01 AM] Me: if brianna was smart she would dump eric and find a boyfriend there, but she is to insecure
[10/14/2005 11:01 AM] jessieface1138: so is it my fault kind of?
[10/14/2005 11:02 AM] jessieface1138: i know i can't make him attracted to me, but i mean, i did kind of start it...
[10/14/2005 11:02 AM] Me: she doesn't have any friends because of the way they spent all their time together and never developed relationhip with anyone else
[10/14/2005 11:03 AM] Me: and he doesn't understand when the right time to dump her is, and its when hes not enjoying it anymore
[10/14/2005 11:03 AM] Me: and he is definitely not enjoying her
[10/14/2005 11:04 AM] Me: you maybe have started it, but what you started is definitely not negative
[10/14/2005 11:04 AM] Me: eric was upset yesterday because someone way back when made a rule that you could only have 1 girlfriend, he wants to move to utah
[10/14/2005 11:04 AM] Me: i have to go to class
[10/14/2005 11:04 AM] Me: ttyl
