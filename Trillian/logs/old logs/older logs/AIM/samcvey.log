[09/22/2005 05:19 PM] Me: i would like to rebuild the 400 they send me
[09/22/2005 05:21 PM] Me: then for birthday+christmas maybe get another 400 especially since their new 7200.9 are coming out soon, then i will do an image from the 400 replacement to a new 400 and raid 0 them
[09/22/2005 05:21 PM] samcvey: if you want to raid, they need to match

[10/13/2005 10:07 AM] samcvey: has to be that brand?
[10/13/2005 10:08 AM] Me: its a really cool design where the arm rests on the side fold out to make a single bed
[10/13/2005 10:08 AM] samcvey: i see
[10/13/2005 10:08 AM] Me: as opposed to make a twin or queen

[10/17/2005 08:59 AM] Me: it seems to only happen when it is a command to restart

[10/17/2005 08:59 AM] Me: i have not flashed it yet i'll check for an update now
[10/17/2005 09:00 AM] Me: would i look on the asus site or nvidia?

[10/17/2005 09:16 AM] Me: forgot
[10/17/2005 09:22 AM] samcvey: wondering if you have to do a bios reset by moving the jumper
[10/17/2005 09:23 AM] samcvey: also, it says you need to be on a recent shipset driver, 6.65 or later
[10/17/2005 09:36 AM] Me: i have 6.66
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] samcvey: ok
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] Me: and i already tried the jumper before
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] Me: didn't help
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] samcvey: after the bios flash?
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] Me: no
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] samcvey: do it again then
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] Me: but it reset the cmos for anyways
[10/17/2005 09:37 AM] samcvey: just to be sure

[10/17/2005 09:38 AM] Me: it asked me to
[10/17/2005 09:38 AM] samcvey: mine expired and i had to buy an update
[10/17/2005 09:42 AM] Me: hmmm
[10/17/2005 09:42 AM] Me: it says it expired
[10/17/2005 09:42 AM] Me: but i updated it and hasn't said it again yet
[10/17/2005 09:43 AM] samcvey: maybe because you're using the same serial number as mine?
[10/17/2005 09:43 AM] Me: it says subscription activated through today
[10/17/2005 09:43 AM] samcvey: check you license, perhaps in About. it should tell you what the expiration date is

[10/18/2005 04:33 PM] Steve McVey: then what got it to work?
[10/18/2005 04:33 PM] Me: then i took out the hard drives, and got it to start

[10/18/2005 04:33 PM] Steve McVey: both ide and sata?
[10/18/2005 04:33 PM] Steve McVey: does unplugging just one work?
[10/18/2005 04:33 PM] Me: then i put my SATA back on and it turned on and brought up the bios screen but it wouldn't receive keyboard input like it froze as soon as it started
[10/18/2005 04:34 PM] Me: and of course i reset the cmos along the way
[10/18/2005 04:34 PM] Steve McVey: did you reset bios with the jumper?
[10/18/2005 04:34 PM] Me: then i unplugged everything but my SATA including pci expansions

[10/18/2005 04:34 PM] Me: that worked it started all the way up
[10/18/2005 04:34 PM] Me: i plugged all the pci stuff back in
[10/18/2005 04:35 PM] Me: and it worked
[10/18/2005 04:35 PM] Me: i plugged the drives back in and it worked
[10/18/2005 04:35 PM] Steve McVey: could be a flaky connection on one of the boards
[10/18/2005 04:35 PM] Me: so not everything is plugged back in except my side panel lights and fans
[10/18/2005 04:35 PM] Steve McVey: its a new boards, so i wonder if they are still finding roblems

[10/18/2005 04:36 PM] Me: i am still very happy with it.... when it works
[10/18/2005 04:37 PM] Me: which is so far only about 30 percent of the time it should be working
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Steve McVey: is it possible that the case is not grounding properly?
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Steve McVey: since its plastic not metal
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Me: i am really considering getting one of those cyber power battery backup babies
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Me: that is very possible
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Me: for example acrylic carries static very well
[10/18/2005 04:38 PM] Steve McVey: check your mb book and see if it has a ground requirement
[10/18/2005 04:39 PM] Me: so maybe someone walking past my computer if they had lots of static could that cause my motherboard to short out?
[10/18/2005 04:39 PM] Steve McVey: doesnt seem likely that it could happen often
[10/18/2005 04:39 PM] Me: well it just happened when Eric passed my computer
[10/18/2005 04:40 PM] Me: i mean it literally just reset on me
[10/18/2005 04:40 PM] Me: and then i started having problems
[10/18/2005 04:40 PM] Steve McVey: is your side panel with the mb attached loose?
[10/18/2005 04:41 PM] Me: but instead lets figure out what could get destroyed assuming that it does happen, would i need to replace my motherboard?  how about memory?
[10/18/2005 04:41 PM] Me: the motherboard is securely attached no it isn't loose
[10/18/2005 04:41 PM] Me: the side panel is also well attached
[10/18/2005 04:41 PM] Steve McVey: ok. that could cause your expansion cards to wobble
[10/18/2005 04:42 PM] Me: i just that the video board
[10/18/2005 04:42 PM] Me: and it is securely attached as well
[10/18/2005 04:42 PM] Me: everything is tightly screwed in
[10/18/2005 04:43 PM] Steve McVey: email support and tell them the symptoms. ask if they recommend grounding in an acrylic case.
[10/18/2005 04:43 PM] Steve McVey: do they have a knowledge base?
[10/18/2005 04:44 PM] Me: i'll check
[10/18/2005 04:44 PM] Steve McVey: what modeL/
[10/18/2005 04:44 PM] Steve McVey: did you register it online?
[10/18/2005 04:45 PM] Me: not sure why?

[10/18/2005 04:49 PM] Me: woah i didn't know so much engergy was left in there even if the power was unplugged
[10/18/2005 04:49 PM] Me: that's crazy
[10/18/2005 04:49 PM] Steve McVey: yup...capacitors
[10/18/2005 04:49 PM] Me: that might help
[10/18/2005 04:49 PM] Me: hopefully
[10/18/2005 04:51 PM] Me: it sure is running slower
[10/18/2005 04:52 PM] Steve McVey: does it auto detect ram and cpu speeds?
[10/18/2005 04:52 PM] Me: probably
[10/18/2005 04:53 PM] Me: should i make it detect manually/
[10/18/2005 04:53 PM] Steve McVey: not if it detects ok
[10/18/2005 04:53 PM] Me: i haven't checked ram
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Me: now it is freezing again
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Me: it stops at the bios and doesn't go anywhere
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Me: and i can't get to the setup to check the ram speed
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Steve McVey: can you get into setup?
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Me: no
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Me: it won't take keyboard input
[10/18/2005 04:54 PM] Steve McVey: possible that it is trying to detecet drives?
[10/18/2005 04:55 PM] Me: i just did a power reset and it worked
[10/18/2005 04:59 PM] Steve McVey: A8N-SLI Deluxe or Premium?
[10/18/2005 04:59 PM] Me: premium

[10/18/2005 05:04 PM] Me: yes
[10/18/2005 05:04 PM] Me: i just did it recently
[10/18/2005 05:04 PM] Steve McVey: forum said there was a problem. you should read down through there ro see if anything sounds familiar
[10/18/2005 05:04 PM] Me: now it won't get passed the bios if i don't do the power reset
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Me: should i plug in the 4 pin next to the pci-e card?
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Steve McVey: don't know. what does manual say?
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Me: i couldn't find any answers to this problem
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Me: it dedicates more power to the card
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Me: makes the system more stable
[10/18/2005 05:09 PM] Steve McVey: you sure?
[10/18/2005 05:10 PM] Steve McVey: That could definitely cause problems

[10/18/2005 05:11 PM] Me: it started properly 3 times in a row
[10/18/2005 05:11 PM] Me: amazing
[10/18/2005 05:11 PM] Me: I found a 4-pin power connector near the PCI-Express x16 slot on A8N-SLI Deluxe/Premium. What is it for? 
 
[10/18/2005 05:12 PM] Me: last page
[10/18/2005 05:13 PM] Me: it sounds more for if the person doesn't have a 24 power supply
[10/18/2005 05:13 PM] Me: i now have both plugged in
[10/18/2005 05:13 PM] Steve McVey: That could certainly do it if it's supposed to have power
[10/18/2005 05:14 PM] Me: nope froze at bios again
[10/18/2005 05:15 PM] Me: and again
[10/18/2005 05:15 PM] Steve McVey: try power supply reset and bios reset
[10/18/2005 05:16 PM] Me: and it will work until the next time i restart
[10/18/2005 05:19 PM] Me: but at least it is turning on each time
[10/18/2005 05:23 PM] Me: i am tired of this, i want to send the entire darn thing back and get a mac
[10/18/2005 05:27 PM] Steve McVey: i suspect that its because the board is so new. check frequently for bios updates.
[10/18/2005 05:27 PM] Steve McVey: tgotta go cya

[10/20/2005 08:38 AM] Me: now i have reason to believe that it is memory, if i leave this stick in it has problems like freezing if i leave it on all night or reseting randomly, but the only problem i have with the other stick is it doesn't load the bios at all if i use windows to restart it
[10/20/2005 08:46 AM] Steve McVey: hmmm.. could be, although it doesnt behave correctly either way
[10/20/2005 08:56 AM] Me: yeah maybe it is restarting ok with the other stick
[10/20/2005 08:57 AM] Me: i will test it some more after the memtest on the suspect bad stick is finished
[10/20/2005 08:57 AM] Steve McVey: ok
[10/20/2005 08:57 AM] Me: so at most i might need to replace both a stick of memory and my motherboard
[10/20/2005 08:58 AM] Me: and i have no doubt that this is all a result from power fluxuations in the dorm

[06/08/2006 11:36 AM] Me: did it reset itself when you were using it earlier?
[06/08/2006 11:37 AM] Steve McVey: no
[06/08/2006 11:37 AM] Steve McVey: was working fine
[06/08/2006 11:38 AM] Me: see that's the kind of stuff that i am talking about
[06/08/2006 11:38 AM] Me: why is it that all of a sudden something that was working, stops working?
[06/08/2006 11:38 AM] Me: it was working all day, you were able to burn a CD
[06/08/2006 11:39 AM] Me: and i can always tell when it resets because trillian was open and when it loads up again its not there, because i took it out of start up
[06/08/2006 11:39 AM] Steve McVey: 5 min and ill go look
[06/08/2006 11:39 AM] Me: it just reset again
[06/08/2006 11:39 AM] Me: no its back up
[06/08/2006 11:39 AM] Me: and i have a message that says "Windows recovered from a serious error"
[06/08/2006 11:40 AM] Me: is there any way for me to figure out what caused the error
[06/08/2006 11:40 AM] Me: of course not, because windows and microsoft is absolutely terrible
[06/08/2006 11:40 AM] Me: is it natural for a computer to NEED to be restarted twice a day?
[06/08/2006 11:41 AM] Me: does windows even have the ability to run for more then 24 hours?
[06/08/2006 11:41 AM] Me: i am absolutely positive that it is not apache causing problems
[06/08/2006 11:42 AM] Me: yeah i am running a web server, but apache is distributed with every version of linux and is probably the most reliable piece of software on there
[06/08/2006 11:42 AM] Steve McVey: tjust read where win servers are more reliable than any linux, but not as good as commercial unix
[06/08/2006 11:42 AM] Me: so there we go
[06/08/2006 11:42 AM] Me: i was running msFTP service today
[06/08/2006 11:43 AM] Me: but even then, it was working all day, so why do things just stop working?
[06/08/2006 11:45 AM] Steve McVey: complexity
[06/08/2006 11:45 AM] Steve McVey: tmine runs for weeks
[06/08/2006 11:45 AM] Me: that's not fair
[06/08/2006 11:45 AM] Me: why can i never get the hardware that doesn't cause errors and reset?
[06/08/2006 11:45 AM] Me: i mean an ethernet port causes errors for me
[06/08/2006 11:46 AM] Me: i stay updated, 2 months later i am having problems again
[06/08/2006 11:46 AM] Me: even when i am running the same software
[06/08/2006 11:46 AM] Me: its like the hardware just changes
[06/08/2006 11:46 AM] Me: i have unplugged an ethernet cord from the port gotten the little bubble in windows and the computer reset on me
[06/08/2006 11:47 AM] Me: i have had problems where if i use the internet too long it will reset
[06/08/2006 11:49 AM] Me: i hope you can understand my frustration, i don't mean to be spilling it all out on you, but its just that i spent 1200 dollars on near top of the line stuff, to me it is still acceptable hardware and i wouldn't consider replacing anything, but even now i can never get to to work just right, i am constantly having computer problems, and unfortunately i can't do anything about it
[06/08/2006 11:50 AM] Me: i can only wonder if it is my hard drive about to fail because it used to reset because of that.  i can't wait for the day when i can't log in and i have you go and check on it and it reads "Boot Disk Error"
[06/08/2006 11:51 AM] Me: i don't have a place to put my music that i have collected and bought, i've spent money on it, where do i back it up to?  my 200gig won't fit all of it

[06/19/2006 01:25 PM] Me: so i was wondering
[06/19/2006 01:26 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[06/19/2006 01:27 PM] Me: do you think that after i get this RS232 infrered receiver i ordered online.  if that works with the serial port, would outputting the commands be as simple as plugging them into the devices RS232 receiver?
[06/19/2006 01:27 PM] Me: so i have the infrared receiver that i record commands with, then i plug one serial port into the other and send the commands to the device
[06/19/2006 01:28 PM] Me: because there are stereo pieces that say they have a RS232 port for upgrades and IR
[06/19/2006 01:28 PM] Steve McVey: possible
[06/19/2006 01:29 PM] Steve McVey: a serial port needs a protocol on both ends
[06/19/2006 01:29 PM] Me: what do you mean?
[06/19/2006 01:29 PM] Steve McVey: both ends have to understand the conversation
[06/19/2006 01:29 PM] Me: yeah
[06/19/2006 01:30 PM] Me: so if a serial port on a stereo receiver is made for IR receiving, and the RS232 standard is used to record the remote control commands, then the stereo receiver should be able to accept the commands directly through the port
[06/19/2006 01:30 PM] Me: the RS232 is the standard for the conversation
[06/19/2006 01:31 PM] Me: so its not just a serial port now, its a serial port using RS232 configuration
[06/19/2006 01:31 PM] Me: and the IR receiver i ordered online said it was RS232
[06/19/2006 01:31 PM] Steve McVey: yes, but rs232 is just a hardware spec.
[06/19/2006 01:31 PM] Steve McVey: software must tell it what to do
[06/19/2006 01:31 PM] Me: yeah
[06/19/2006 01:32 PM] Me: well it should just be a binary command
[06/19/2006 01:32 PM] Me: so i think the stereo receiver should be able to accept that directly if it can take an IR signal
[06/19/2006 01:32 PM] Steve McVey: and what data does it need to see in what sequence?
[06/19/2006 01:33 PM] Me: what ever the remote control sends it
[06/19/2006 01:33 PM] Steve McVey: and what is that?
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Me: so if i record that with my laptop then send it out a serial port into the stereo receiver it should be able to accept it because it will be whatever the remote control sends it also
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Me: i am not sure yet, i haven't been able to record anything
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Me: this is what i ordered
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Me: (Link: http://www.irblaster.info/receiver.html)http://www.irblaster.info/receiver.html
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Me: so can i use an IR Blaster, the link above that section to send 1 signal?
[06/19/2006 01:34 PM] Steve McVey: if you can find info on the data streams and the rules they follow, that will help
[06/19/2006 01:35 PM] Me: yeah that's what the recording will do
[06/19/2006 01:35 PM] Steve McVey: gotta hop on a call.
[06/19/2006 01:35 PM] Me: ok ttyl

[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Steve McVey: one of your apache services is pounding my network, so i stopped them both.
[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: what are you talking about?
[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: there isn't even any activity
[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Steve McVey: your computer is using up much of my bandwidth
[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Steve McVey: i find when i stop the apache services that the problem goes away
[06/24/2006 04:40 PM] Me: how do you know its my computer?
[06/24/2006 04:41 PM] Me: is my computer still plugged in because now i can't get to it at all
[06/24/2006 04:41 PM] Steve McVey: becuase i can see the router light going full time and when i unplug it everything gets better
[06/24/2006 04:41 PM] Me: well plug me back in so that I can find out what is wrong instead of just making assumptions
[06/24/2006 04:41 PM] Steve McVey: it is plugged innow, but apache is not running
[06/24/2006 04:42 PM] Me: i can't remote desktop to it
[06/24/2006 04:42 PM] Steve McVey: pardon me, but there are no assumptions being made here
[06/24/2006 04:42 PM] Steve McVey: ispent an hour last night with the network monitor
[06/24/2006 04:42 PM] Steve McVey: figuring out who was eating my network
[06/24/2006 04:42 PM] Me: so why can't i remote desktop now?
[06/24/2006 04:43 PM] Me: is my computer connected in my room?
[06/24/2006 04:43 PM] Steve McVey: dunno. is your ip address .100?
[06/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: i cannot connect at all
[06/24/2006 04:44 PM] Me: it should be 101
[06/24/2006 04:44 PM] Steve McVey: nope. the router says .100 and it is .100
[06/24/2006 04:45 PM] Me: ok well i should still be able to connect
[06/24/2006 04:45 PM] Me: port 3390 is being forwarded?
[06/24/2006 04:45 PM] Steve McVey: yes. if i'm logged in, would that prevent your remote desktop from working?
[06/24/2006 04:45 PM] Me: it should let me connect
[06/24/2006 04:45 PM] Me: are you logged in still?
[06/24/2006 04:46 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[06/24/2006 04:46 PM] Me: try pressing windowskey+L
[06/24/2006 04:46 PM] Me: did you change the IP address?
[06/24/2006 04:46 PM] Me: what is the IP address of the router?
[06/24/2006 04:47 PM] Steve McVey: ip is 24.251.157.116
[06/24/2006 04:47 PM] Me: still got nothing
[06/24/2006 04:47 PM] Me: is my computer running or using the hard drive?
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: running any scans?
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Steve McVey: no not now
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: is it connected?
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Steve McVey: did last night
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Steve McVey: yes
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: is my computer getting and IP address?
[06/24/2006 04:48 PM] Me: it might say its connected but not really be connected
[06/24/2006 04:49 PM] Steve McVey: yes, 192.168.15.100
[06/24/2006 04:49 PM] Me: then there is no reason i should not be able to remote desktop to it, unless of course windows just decided to crap out on me again
[06/24/2006 04:49 PM] Me: will you go in an restart it?
[06/24/2006 04:50 PM] Steve McVey: i will, but we'll need to get rid of apache soon after
[06/24/2006 04:51 PM] Me: i will
[06/24/2006 04:51 PM] Me: i will figure out what is taking up so much bandwidth using Sygate, it prints out network usage
[06/24/2006 04:51 PM] Me: then i can figure out if it is apache or another program
[06/24/2006 04:51 PM] Steve McVey: all i know is stopping the apache service makes it go away
[06/24/2006 04:52 PM] Me: ok
[06/24/2006 04:56 PM] Steve McVey: restarted and immediately eating my bandwidth
[06/24/2006 04:56 PM] Me: ok
[06/24/2006 04:57 PM] Me: did you just log on?
[06/24/2006 04:57 PM] Me: or did my computer just reset itself again?
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Steve McVey: yes i logged in
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Steve McVey: did you create a temp user?
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Me: a temp user?
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Me: for apache?
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Me: oh yes for windows
[06/24/2006 04:58 PM] Me: i was playing around with the ftp service
[06/24/2006 04:59 PM] Me: turns out the only way for you to designate a user to a specific directory with the ftp service is to create a user account with the same name as the virtual directory that you want
[06/24/2006 04:59 PM] Me: kind of dumb
[06/24/2006 05:00 PM] Me: i think i diagnosed the problem
[06/24/2006 05:01 PM] Steve McVey: and?
[06/24/2006 05:01 PM] Me: my friend Dave is downloading from me
[06/24/2006 05:01 PM] Steve McVey: all day long?
[06/24/2006 05:02 PM] Me: yes
[06/24/2006 05:02 PM] Steve McVey: not any more....
[06/24/2006 05:02 PM] Me: i turned it off
[06/24/2006 05:03 PM] Steve McVey: ok. no problem over niht when i'm sleeping, but during the day its affecting my phone lines

[07/16/2006 04:17 PM] Me: I restarted my computer about 10 minutes ago and its still not responding, think you could check on it when you get the chance, i am trying to get my site working again
[07/16/2006 04:39 PM] Me: this is very strange
[07/16/2006 04:40 PM] Me: i think the corruption from a little while back has something to do with this problem i am having
[07/16/2006 04:40 PM] Me: apache keeps listing out a file in an image directory that i deleted
[07/16/2006 04:41 PM] Me: it only lists one file when there was 10 files in it, and it still lists it even though the entire parents directory is gone
[07/16/2006 04:41 PM] Steve McVey: maybe you should run a more thorough hard rive check . Norton?
[07/16/2006 04:41 PM] Me: yeah that was i was just going to ask
[07/16/2006 04:42 PM] Steve McVey: its been years since i have a true corrupted drive like that
[07/16/2006 04:43 PM] Me: yeah
[07/16/2006 04:43 PM] Me: but my problem is i can't pinpoint a certain program responsible
[07/16/2006 04:43 PM] Me: i turned off sygate and it seems to happen less
[07/16/2006 04:44 PM] Me: apache is pretty memory intensive but there are no blue screens, and it never happens periodically
[07/16/2006 04:44 PM] Steve McVey: your config is too complex.....
[07/16/2006 04:45 PM] Steve McVey: impossible to narrow it dow with all that stuff running
[07/16/2006 04:45 PM] Me: they're just applications, the only thing in common ethernet card access
[07/16/2006 04:46 PM] Me: which i've had problems with before, if that explains the resets, then i wouldn't doubt apache explains the corruption
[07/16/2006 04:46 PM] Steve McVey: a firewall is an application?
[07/16/2006 04:46 PM] Me: yes
[07/16/2006 04:46 PM] Me: well with driver extensions
[07/16/2006 04:47 PM] Steve McVey: so is an operating system
[07/16/2006 04:47 PM] Me: but i've disabled that, it doesn't loads the drivers so it shouldn't be causing problems
[07/16/2006 04:48 PM] Steve McVey: how many things start automatically?
[07/16/2006 04:50 PM] Me: well the standard services, apache, mysql, tomcat, norton stuff, video drivers stuff, my processes list isn't very long, and i hardly use half my memory
[07/16/2006 04:51 PM] Steve McVey: then i guess all is well
[07/16/2006 04:51 PM] Me: yeah i wish
[07/16/2006 04:53 PM] Steve McVey: strokeit?
[07/16/2006 04:53 PM] Me: yeah
[07/16/2006 04:53 PM] Steve McVey: and what else?
[07/16/2006 04:54 PM] Me: daemon
[07/16/2006 04:54 PM] Steve McVey: what s that?
[07/16/2006 04:54 PM] Me: one note
[07/16/2006 04:54 PM] Me: for mounting cd images
[07/16/2006 04:54 PM] Steve McVey: no wat that application could do anything unusual....
[07/16/2006 04:55 PM] Me: its just custom cd drivers
[07/16/2006 04:55 PM] Steve McVey: is that all?
[07/16/2006 04:56 PM] Me: yeah
[07/16/2006 04:56 PM] Steve McVey: then i guess there isnt anything that could be causing it

[07/24/2006 05:37 PM] Me: hmmm can't get pptp to work from a computer outside the network
[07/24/2006 05:37 PM] Steve McVey: what are you trying to do?
[07/24/2006 05:38 PM] Me: create a VPN between my laptop and server
[07/24/2006 05:38 PM] Me: so that i can map a network drive to my music server and load the music files into WMP locally
[07/24/2006 05:39 PM] Steve McVey: Do you have a server-side piece of softare running to do that?
[07/24/2006 05:41 PM] Me: the windows Incoming Connections
[07/24/2006 05:41 PM] Me: its supposed to support PPTP connections
[07/24/2006 05:41 PM] Me: and i forwarded the port also
[07/24/2006 05:41 PM] Me: but still nothing
[07/24/2006 05:43 PM] Me: does the router support Ips 192.168.15.10 to .11?
[07/24/2006 05:43 PM] Me: starts at 100 and there are 12
[07/24/2006 05:45 PM] Steve McVey: 100 - 112
[07/24/2006 05:45 PM] Steve McVey: not 10 - 12
[07/24/2006 05:45 PM] Me: that's what i meant
[07/24/2006 05:46 PM] Me: i claimed IP addresses with the accept incoming connections
[07/24/2006 05:46 PM] Me: i claimed the addresses 192.168.15.110 and 192.168.15.111
[07/24/2006 05:47 PM] Steve McVey: just dont mees up my router. i've got phone calls to be on this afternoon and a restart will kill them
[07/24/2006 05:47 PM] Me: ok
[07/24/2006 05:47 PM] Me: port settings don't need to restart the router
[07/24/2006 05:53 PM] Me: will you try connecting to my servers vpn
[07/24/2006 06:00 PM] Me: i think my computer just reset it self again
[07/24/2006 06:05 PM] Steve McVey: how do i do that?
[07/24/2006 06:05 PM] Me: uhhh well i think it died again
[07/24/2006 06:06 PM] Me: i got it to connect through 127.0.0.1
[07/24/2006 06:06 PM] Me: but now i can't access it at all
[07/24/2006 06:06 PM] Steve McVey: isn't that your own computer?
[07/24/2006 06:06 PM] Me: yeah
[07/24/2006 06:06 PM] Me: i did that on my server
[07/24/2006 06:07 PM] Me: so it was accessing itself ok
[07/24/2006 06:07 PM] Me: and i am not sure if that changed my current connection or if it just reset my computer, because now i can't get back on to it
[07/24/2006 06:07 PM] Me: will you tell me if it is stuck on a disk scan
[07/24/2006 06:07 PM] Me: ?
[07/24/2006 06:08 PM] Me: i need to back up my files again before my disk gets so corrupted that i can't read it
[07/24/2006 06:09 PM] Me: wait nvm
[07/24/2006 06:09 PM] Me: i got it back
[07/24/2006 06:09 PM] Steve McVey: i just logged in and it said the vpn was connected, so i dosconneced it
[07/24/2006 06:09 PM] Me: interesting
[07/24/2006 06:10 PM] Me: that it would interfere with my working connection
[07/24/2006 06:10 PM] Me: thank you though
[07/24/2006 06:10 PM] Steve McVey: if you use 127.0.01, i would guess that would not work too well
[07/24/2006 06:10 PM] Me: how about using a LAN address?
[07/24/2006 06:11 PM] Steve McVey: what two things are you trying to onnect?
[07/24/2006 06:11 PM] Me: a VPN connection is supposed to go on top of your existing connect, not replace it
[07/24/2006 06:11 PM] Steve McVey: yes, so what two things are you trying to connect?
[07/24/2006 06:11 PM] Me: i want to connect my laptop to my server through a VPN, so i can get file and printer sharing
[07/24/2006 06:12 PM] Steve McVey: then using 127.0.0.1 wouldnt do it
[07/24/2006 06:12 PM] Me: so let say it can connect to its own vpn through 127.0.0.1 then obviously its not a settings problem
[07/24/2006 06:12 PM] Steve McVey: is there a specific port that needs to be open to your computer?
[07/24/2006 06:12 PM] Me: so now if i connect through 192.168.15.100 then its not a computer problem
[07/24/2006 06:13 PM] Steve McVey: that is an internal LAN address
[07/24/2006 06:13 PM] Me: so if i can't connect using the router ip address, it absolutely must be a port problem on the router, i'm just trying to narrow down the problem possibilities
[07/24/2006 06:13 PM] Steve McVey: the only address you can see is the router address
[07/24/2006 06:14 PM] Me: and i don't understand why it kicked off my entire computers network connection
[07/24/2006 06:14 PM] Me: yes i know, i am just testing it locally on the server, not even trying to connect my laptop yet, i need to know if the server setting are correct
[07/24/2006 06:14 PM] Me: but why would it ruin my apache server and remote desktop connections, just by connecting to a vpn?
[07/24/2006 06:15 PM] Steve McVey: connecting to a vpn makes you part of the remote network, so that could have ended your desktop session
[07/24/2006 06:16 PM] Me: hmmm
[07/24/2006 06:17 PM] Me: ok so if you were to try it, as long as you aren't in the middle of file sharing
[07/24/2006 06:18 PM] Steve McVey: are you on a router on your end?
[07/24/2006 06:18 PM] Me: yes
[07/24/2006 06:18 PM] Steve McVey: Is outbound PPTP enabled on that router?
[07/24/2006 06:20 PM] Me: maybe not
[07/24/2006 06:20 PM] Me: you would add a connection, then "connect to a business network at my workplace" then on the next page select VPN
[07/24/2006 06:20 PM] Me: does it have to be enabled on the router?
[07/24/2006 06:20 PM] Me: if i was going to try it from my dads network
[07/24/2006 06:21 PM] Steve McVey: there is typically an option for that in the router to do VPN pass-thru

[07/25/2006 04:05 PM] Me: wanna know why?
[07/25/2006 04:05 PM] Steve McVey: Cause you have lots of money to waste and then be obsolete next week?
[07/25/2006 04:05 PM] Me: LOL
[07/25/2006 04:06 PM] Me: know because i hate my current phone and it would be a reasonable investment
[07/25/2006 04:06 PM] Me: and because i can develop for it
[07/25/2006 04:06 PM] Me: :-P
[07/25/2006 04:06 PM] Steve McVey: Don't use the word investment with electronics or cars
[07/25/2006 04:07 PM] Steve McVey: spend your money getting smart instead of collecting "things"
[07/25/2006 04:08 PM] Me: so what if i learn from getting a mobile phone?  i am investing in it because i will learn how to develop on smaller devices
[07/25/2006 04:08 PM] Steve McVey: however you wish to justify it
[07/25/2006 04:08 PM] Steve McVey: it's your money
[07/25/2006 04:09 PM] Me: actually the real reason is because i want to hook an external hard drive up to the phone and download all my MP3s into my car
[07/25/2006 04:09 PM] Steve McVey: how about investing equal amounts to that which you spend?
[07/25/2006 04:10 PM] Me: hm?
[07/25/2006 04:11 PM] Me: i'd rather not spend money at all
[07/25/2006 04:11 PM] Me: but i need to hard drives because i worry about data loss, and i need a new phone because i hate this one, so if i am going to buy a new phone it might as well be something i know i will like, heck if i don't like it, at least i can develop for it and change it so that i do
[07/25/2006 04:12 PM] Me: *new
