[10/05/2005 06:11 PM] trumpetchewie: i am an admin for a multi gaming clan, pcgamerasylum.com ; i know a few things just to let ya know
[10/05/2005 06:11 PM] Me: oh good good
[10/05/2005 06:11 PM] Me: anything to help let me make you an admin for this group
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] trumpetchewie: I am pretty good at quake 3 console commands and things
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] trumpetchewie: other stuff too
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] Me: yeah me too i love quake 3
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] trumpetchewie: well refering to the engine i mean
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] Me: so far i have set up a quake 3, doom 3, halo pc, and half life server
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] Me: dedicated of course
[10/05/2005 06:12 PM] trumpetchewie: cool
[10/05/2005 06:13 PM] trumpetchewie: this is gonna be fun!
[10/05/2005 06:13 PM] Me: lots of fun, yeah i love the quake 3 engine, especially how so many companies have bought it
[10/05/2005 06:13 PM] trumpetchewie: yeah, 
[10/05/2005 06:14 PM] Me: we are now admin and officer
[10/05/2005 06:14 PM] Me: for the group
[10/05/2005 06:14 PM] Me: there aren't many people that know much about this sort of thing, so i am glad you have experience with another clan
[10/05/2005 06:14 PM] trumpetchewie: my current FPS's that i own are halflife and halflife 2, their counterstrike counterparts, doom 3, i had halo,  enemy territory, DOD Source, 
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] trumpetchewie: UT 2004
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] trumpetchewie: hmm
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] Me: i tried to start one, it had all of 7 members, but we had a really nice website complete with forums
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] Me: i love all of those
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] trumpetchewie: i bunch of mods
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] Me: except counterstrike
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] Me: so if we do this i think we should start off with quake 3 and doom 3, i think those will be the most recognized and popular
[10/05/2005 06:15 PM] trumpetchewie: i cant think of anything else, 
[10/05/2005 06:16 PM] Me: then we can get into some valve (sucks for Mac users)
[10/05/2005 06:16 PM] Me: and UT is awesome
[10/05/2005 06:16 PM] trumpetchewie: actually all i have now thats quake 3 ish is enemy territory, i lost a lot of image files a while ago
[10/05/2005 06:16 PM] Me: and of course Halo will be going on the X-Box the whole time
[10/05/2005 06:16 PM] trumpetchewie: lol
[10/05/2005 06:17 PM] trumpetchewie: they didnt move the second one to pc, why?
[10/05/2005 06:17 PM] Me: yeah well i'll get you set back up, i have all of those so i can rip them for you if you like
[10/05/2005 06:17 PM] trumpetchewie: cool
[10/05/2005 06:17 PM] Me: i am not sure about the second one
[10/05/2005 06:17 PM] trumpetchewie: ill go download a keygen then.

[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] trumpetchewie: its not working so hot with my board or something, maybe i need a faster processor
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] Me: hmmm
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] Me: what is the one you have now?
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] trumpetchewie: actually i think its because i need a new monitor
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] trumpetchewie: really old, horrible refresh rate crap
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] Me: could be, if the refresh rate it slow
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] trumpetchewie: or however that works
[10/05/2005 06:20 PM] Me: yeah

[10/28/2005 05:00 PM] Me: the one on my desktop when playing a video game will clock at 4.2 ghz
[10/28/2005 05:01 PM] Me: but it was 500 dolla
[10/28/2005 05:01 PM] Me: i like AMDs better though
[10/28/2005 05:01 PM] Me: they are more powerfull then pentiums when it comes to gaming

[10/28/2005 06:24 PM] Me: a 4800 X2 is better then a FX 57

[10/28/2005 06:24 PM] Me: how much you looking to spend?
[10/28/2005 06:25 PM] Michael Rivera: for now im just going to compile a list of what I want for a machine
[10/28/2005 06:25 PM] Me: ah
[10/28/2005 06:25 PM] Me: definitely go PCI-E
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Michael Rivera: yeah 
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Michael Rivera: and SLI tech
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Me: playing quake 3 i get over 400 FPS
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Michael Rivera: oh shit.
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Me: i would definitely go AIW X800 XL PCI-E
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Me: do you care about having a TV Tuner?
[10/28/2005 06:26 PM] Michael Rivera: oh I was thinking of going with NVIDIA
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: for their &800 chip they are going to comeout with soon
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: for their 780 0chip
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fasdjklfdas;ljkfdas
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fda
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fads
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fasd
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fasd
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: fasd
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Michael Rivera: 7800 chip
[10/28/2005 06:27 PM] Me: just keep in mind, a 6800 is better then a 9800 but an x800 is better then 2 6800 dual screen
[10/28/2005 06:28 PM] Me: however the new 7800 is about as powerful as a x800 so SLI 7800 is better then an x800 but not twice a good
[10/28/2005 06:28 PM] Me: if that makes any sense
[10/28/2005 06:29 PM] Me: so go with the Asus A8N-SLI Premium
[10/28/2005 06:29 PM] Michael Rivera: ATI seriously?
[10/28/2005 06:29 PM] Me: i like ATI
[10/28/2005 06:29 PM] Michael Rivera: oh ok
[10/28/2005 06:29 PM] Me: it is more powerful in single mode, but the sli i more powerful but not twice
[10/28/2005 06:30 PM] Me: but you pay about the same amount for 1 of either GeForce or ATI
[10/28/2005 06:30 PM] Me: i love the All in Wonder, so i stick with ATI
[10/28/2005 06:30 PM] Michael Rivera: gotcha
[10/28/2005 06:30 PM] Me: but if having a TV tuner on your computer doesn't matter then go with the 7800
[10/28/2005 06:31 PM] Me: MSI has a card with the 7800 chip, i would like to see an Nvidia version though
[10/28/2005 06:31 PM] Michael Rivera: yeah
[10/28/2005 06:32 PM] Me: definitely go with the Asus A8N though, i am very happy with mine, its a socket 939 so it can handle a 4200-4800 X2 AMD and it comes with dual gigabit lan, 8-channel audio with 6 jacks
[10/28/2005 06:32 PM] Me: it has coaxial and optical out for sound
[10/28/2005 06:33 PM] Michael Rivera: oh wow
[10/28/2005 06:33 PM] Me: yeah its nice
[10/28/2005 06:33 PM] Me: its got 4 SATA and 4 RAID SATA
[10/28/2005 06:33 PM] Me: so 8 in all is nice
[10/28/2005 06:33 PM] Me: 2 channel IDE
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Me: 10 USB
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Me: 2 Firewire
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Me: i think 2 media ports
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Me: its amazing
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Me: its definitely worth putting into a full tower case
[10/28/2005 06:34 PM] Michael Rivera: yeah I was going to go with ASUS, or maybe SOYO again, 
[10/28/2005 06:35 PM] Michael Rivera: there was also someone else
[10/28/2005 06:35 PM] Me: because most of those are onboard expansions so it takes up PCI slots on the case
[10/28/2005 06:35 PM] Me: i would go with Asus, but soyo isn't a bad choice either
[10/28/2005 06:35 PM] Me: i've just heard good things about asus, and i've likes it so far
[10/28/2005 06:36 PM] Me: also another feature is it can devote an entire 4 pin power to the video boards
[10/28/2005 06:37 PM] Me: with two 7800 you will need it, with just 1 card you don't need it buts its still nice
[10/28/2005 06:37 PM] Michael Rivera: so what if I got their deluxe sli board
[10/28/2005 06:38 PM] Me: no
[10/28/2005 06:38 PM] Me: its got a few problems with ATI video cards
[10/28/2005 06:38 PM] Me: and if you look at the reviews i think there was something that burns out on it
[10/28/2005 06:38 PM] Michael Rivera: so the premium is more compatable with ATI?
[10/28/2005 06:38 PM] Me: its been fixed in the premium version
[10/28/2005 06:39 PM] Me: yes
[10/28/2005 06:39 PM] Michael Rivera: but what if I go with NVIDIA
[10/28/2005 06:39 PM] Me: i would still get the premium
[10/28/2005 06:39 PM] Me: its newer, its not that much of a price difference is it?
[10/28/2005 06:40 PM] Michael Rivera: so premium is better than deluxe?
[10/28/2005 06:40 PM] Me: yes
[10/28/2005 06:40 PM] Me: the premium is their newest
