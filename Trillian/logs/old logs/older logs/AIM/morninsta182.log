[07/22/2005 01:03 AM] Danica: cool
[07/22/2005 01:04 AM] Me: During World War III an elite group of scientists from all over the world was formed.  Predicting the destruction of earth they traveled to the moon to begin colonization.  Nuclear war broke out and rendered the Earth’s resources useless while on the moon a failed Terre formation left a strange cloudy un-breathable atmosphere close to the surface.  A large gravity generator was placed in the center of the moon but also failed and caused the moon to stop its rotation.  As the project continued and more survivors from the nuclear war arrived a Utopian lifestyle was formed on the light side of the moon.  The dark side of the moon was used as a waste disposal site during the war.  Now refugees and hitchhikers inhabit the wastelands.  You have an experimental implant made to allow you to breath in the foggy atmosphere outside of the shielded cities.  Though you are well established and an experienced bounty hunter, you still fight to find your place in society.
[07/22/2005 01:04 AM] Me: that is the description
