[06/29/2006 02:51 PM] Keifer Street: hahha
[06/29/2006 02:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i might just take this mac from the office
[06/29/2006 02:52 PM] Keifer Street: Yes, but I'm thinking about waiting until after the semester starts before I do to ensure that I will have enough to cover my room and board
[06/29/2006 02:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: isn't your dad going to help you pay for school?
[06/29/2006 02:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or is he already paying tuition?
[06/29/2006 02:52 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: room and board should be about 2700
[06/29/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no wait
[06/29/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not that much
[06/29/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: like 2000$
[06/29/2006 02:53 PM] Keifer Street: Well, he is going to pay... but I don't want to put 100% of the weight on his shoulders, besides... I'm guessing that I'm going to need a little, "slush money" for groceries and the like
[06/29/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah good idea
[06/29/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you better not be a moocher
[06/29/2006 02:54 PM] Keifer Street: Haha... no... well in the past few weeks I've saved up $650... so... I think I can get $1500 or more before I go back
[06/29/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i want server components after working here
[06/29/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: is that aside from the money to pay for the mac?
[06/29/2006 02:55 PM] Keifer Street: No

[06/29/2006 02:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am going to get a rackmount server for the room
[06/29/2006 02:56 PM] Keifer Street: Well... our computers would be connected to eachother almost seamlessly, but that would bae about it, right?  Our conneciton to the internet could not get any faster
[06/29/2006 02:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: true
[06/29/2006 02:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i am going to build a new linux based server
[06/29/2006 02:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so file transfer speeds would be very important since all my files will be on a different computer
[06/29/2006 02:59 PM] Keifer Street: Did you hear that Richard got another hard drive and installed linux on it... he's been toying around with it for a while
[06/29/2006 02:59 PM] Keifer Street: to quote him, "VERY user unfriendly"
[06/29/2006 02:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol

[06/29/2006 02:59 PM] Keifer Street: I'm not exactly sure which version he installed, but he told me that it took him a while to figure it out
[06/29/2006 03:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: lol
[06/29/2006 03:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: silly richard linux is for uber 1337 hax0rs 0/\/1y

[08/13/2006 07:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: there are infinite possibilities on how to install it
[08/13/2006 07:00 PM] Keifer Street: hmmmmm
[08/13/2006 07:01 PM] Keifer Street: I suppose I should have asked a more appropriate question
[08/13/2006 07:01 PM] Keifer Street: Does it work?
[08/13/2006 07:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[08/13/2006 07:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: it worked the 2nd and 3rd time
[08/13/2006 07:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i still didn't know if it was right
[08/13/2006 07:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so i stopped after the 4th time installing it
[08/13/2006 07:04 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: now i am copying files over
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: then i am going to work on my new server
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] Keifer Street: cool
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah lots of work to do
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i will probably need more hard drives
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because i only have 250
[08/13/2006 07:05 PM] Keifer Street: What are you going to use the server for?
[08/13/2006 07:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: file serving and my websites
[08/13/2006 07:07 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i want to back up my entire hard drive to it
[08/13/2006 07:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i need 2 more seagates
[08/13/2006 07:08 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: at least 2 more
[08/13/2006 07:08 PM] Keifer Street: You and you're security... who needs security... you could have twice the space... I've never had a hard drive quit on me yet
[08/13/2006 07:08 PM] Keifer Street: lol
[08/13/2006 07:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: someday
[08/13/2006 07:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you will lose everything
[08/13/2006 07:09 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and be like shit i should have listened to brian
[08/13/2006 07:09 PM] Keifer Street: Nope because I will have a Mac and I'll use the new features in Leapord's "Time Machine" to solve all of those problems
[08/13/2006 07:09 PM] Keifer Street: *Leopard's
[08/13/2006 07:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not if the hard drive dies douche bag
[08/13/2006 07:10 PM] Keifer Street: You have no idea what I'm talking about
[08/13/2006 07:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is time machine/
[08/13/2006 07:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ?
[08/13/2006 07:11 PM] Keifer Street: (Link: http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html)http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/timemachine.html
[08/13/2006 07:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: great that stupid apple page froze my computer
[08/13/2006 07:12 PM] Keifer Street: haha
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the drives could still die douche bag
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] Keifer Street: Just watch the quicktime video and you'll know what I'm talking about
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah... BOTH would have to die
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's the exact same thing i am doing
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dur dur dur
[08/13/2006 07:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why not use the external drive as another drive to store other files?
[08/13/2006 07:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's the exact same thing i am doing
[08/13/2006 07:14 PM] Keifer Street: Because 500GB is enough for me
[08/13/2006 07:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah well i will have 500 gigabytes also
[08/13/2006 07:14 PM] Keifer Street: Oh yeah?  Well, how many HD's is it going to take for you to get 500GB?
[08/13/2006 07:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: dude it doesn't matter, there is a reason i am using small drives, you want to know why?
[08/13/2006 07:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because of speed, partition size, organization, do you know what these words mean?
[08/13/2006 07:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sure i could have bought 2 500 GB drives
[08/13/2006 07:15 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i don't want to
[08/13/2006 07:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because if a drive fails i'd rather replace 1/4th of my system, then 1/2
[08/13/2006 07:16 PM] Keifer Street: All I am saying is that I don't think that the security you get from buying an additional HD is not worth the money
[08/13/2006 07:16 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: OMFG
[08/13/2006 07:17 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok buying 3 of my 4 drives has the same price as one of your douche baggish 500GB drives
[08/13/2006 07:18 PM] Keifer Street: I'm not speaking in particular about Macs.  Even with a personally built computer, I would much rather pay twice as much for space, not security.
[08/13/2006 07:19 PM] Keifer Street: If anything I would have 1 external drive as a backup... but that's as far as I would ever go
[08/13/2006 07:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok well that's what i am doing excepts its internal instead of external
[08/13/2006 07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am buying more
[08/13/2006 07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 2 seagates and a spare PCI adapter for 4 more after that
[08/13/2006 07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: incase i have to plug in someone else's or want to add more
[08/13/2006 07:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am paying less for space then you would ever pay for mac space
[08/13/2006 07:23 PM] Keifer Street: I don't argue that
[08/13/2006 07:23 PM] Keifer Street: I know Macs, in general, cost more than PC's
[08/13/2006 07:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: for 500GB its costing my $160, where as a Mac, you pay around $300 for 500GB all on 1 drive
[08/13/2006 07:23 PM] Keifer Street: However, I am willing to pay for the performance and design
[08/13/2006 07:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: understand now?
[08/13/2006 07:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: do you understand?
[08/13/2006 07:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why i am buying the hard drives 250GB per drive?
[08/13/2006 07:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because it only costs me $80 instead of Mac price
[08/13/2006 07:26 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not to mention these seagates have a 5 year warrenty and use upcoming perpendicular recording
[08/13/2006 07:27 PM] Keifer Street: (read previous statements)
[08/13/2006 07:36 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: fucking keifer you don't understand
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: Mac buys their drives from another company!
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: their not special just for mac
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] Keifer Street: Yes they are
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its the exact same technology
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no their not
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they use SATA II now
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's it
[08/13/2006 07:37 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i could take it out and plug it into my linux box and read your file system
[08/13/2006 07:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: mac doesn't even use a special file system
[08/13/2006 07:38 PM] Keifer Street: This is where you fail to understand, my weasly, little friend
[08/13/2006 07:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: no you don't understand
[08/13/2006 07:38 PM] Keifer Street: I would pay more for a Mac HD because if its exterior design
[08/13/2006 07:38 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: mac makes very few parts themselves
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ah
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but what about the interior one?
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the one that goes inside the computer?
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah sure an external drive would be nice
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not special though
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: the design is it
[08/13/2006 07:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: performance is exactly the same as i could buy from another company for cheaper
[08/13/2006 07:40 PM] Keifer Street: Did you know that Dell Computer Inc. is one of the most financially stable companies on the market?
[08/13/2006 07:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i am willing to bet that the interface is firewire 800, and all companies have external hard drives with firewire 800
[08/13/2006 07:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: sure i'd believe that
[08/13/2006 07:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because they don't just invest in their shit laptops
[08/13/2006 07:41 PM] Keifer Street: They are extremely smart with a lot of their business practices... for example... all of the warehouses and factories are leased to make the compnay more liquid
[08/13/2006 07:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: they have some nice higher end stuff, but their standard under $1200 dollar laptops suck
[08/13/2006 07:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: that's a good idea
[08/13/2006 07:41 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but how did we get off topic about arguing about macs
[08/13/2006 07:42 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah... I'm learning a lot about accounting and the business world from this book I bought... "Accounting Demystified"
[08/13/2006 07:42 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: cool
[08/13/2006 07:42 PM] Keifer Street: Speaking of Macs... did I mention that I'm applying to be one of NAU's "Apple Campus Sales Representatives"?
[08/13/2006 07:43 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well why don't i demystify exactly what you are paying brand name prices for when buying a Mac, you want me to do that?  i would be willing to research for you, every single component of the mac system you pick out, and compare prices and find the original manufacturer
[08/13/2006 07:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes you mentioned that, Ryan is going to go apeshit
[08/13/2006 07:44 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: hey i meant to ask you, have you ever had the desire to give a girl oral sex?
[08/13/2006 07:52 PM] Keifer Street: Yes, I have had the desire
[08/13/2006 07:52 PM] Keifer Street: More than that, I actually have, many times
[08/13/2006 07:53 PM] Keifer Street: I'm not exactly proud of it, knowing who I am and what I beleive, but I cannot deny my past
[08/13/2006 07:56 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what about when you get married will you go down on your wife?
[08/13/2006 07:57 PM] Keifer Street: Oh yes
[08/13/2006 07:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: same here
[08/13/2006 07:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i'd go down on Christina
[08/13/2006 07:57 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but maybe back out because its too naughty
[08/13/2006 07:57 PM] Keifer Street: I wouldn't expect a woman to give me head if I was unwilling to do the same
[08/13/2006 07:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wouldn't expect a woman to give me head even if i went down on her
[08/13/2006 07:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: see i want to go down on a woman because i want to, not because she wants me to
[08/13/2006 07:58 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: why are females so grossed out by the idea of oral sex?
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] Keifer Street: haha... Sarah was the same way... she liked it, but she was afraid that I'd be too grossed out when I did it
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i asked Christina if she would ever let a guy go down on her, even if they were married, and she said it was disgusting
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] Keifer Street: I'm sure she would change her mind ... in fact, I KNOW she would
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i'm pretty sure she would too
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you go down on Sarah?
[08/13/2006 07:59 PM] Keifer Street: Yes
[08/13/2006 08:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: really?  i thought you were christian when you met her?
[08/13/2006 08:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you naughty boy you
[08/13/2006 08:00 PM] Keifer Street: I was... but I told you... the ONLY thing Sarah and I didn't do was vaginal/penis intercourse
[08/13/2006 08:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah
[08/13/2006 08:00 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i guess i forgot what that did include
[08/13/2006 08:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: look i'm not saying that what you did what right or wrong, and being sexually active in any way should never become a habit or main focus in a relationship
[08/13/2006 08:01 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but some times, there is a need to keep that part of your body and mind alive
[08/13/2006 08:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i mean i know its probably not christ like to be sexually active in ANY way before marriage
[08/13/2006 08:02 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but still, if you don't use it, you lose it
[08/13/2006 08:03 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and a big reason for divorce, is because of sexual dissatisfaction with your partner, you wouldn't want that to happen before it starts.
[08/13/2006 08:05 PM] Keifer Street: haha
[08/13/2006 08:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i was showing my brother linux
[08/13/2006 08:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i love linux
[08/13/2006 08:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: omfg dude
[08/13/2006 08:10 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: ok heres something you will like
[08/13/2006 08:10 PM] Keifer Street: haha
[08/13/2006 08:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i have this picture of a chick that is naked but has xbox controllers over her breasts and her crotch
[08/13/2006 08:11 PM] Keifer Street: You've shown me that one before... its an Xbox 360 controller, right?
[08/13/2006 08:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i got christina to agree to let me take a picture of her like that
[08/13/2006 08:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[08/13/2006 08:11 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so now all i need is controllers
[08/13/2006 08:12 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what do you say?
[08/13/2006 08:12 PM] Keifer Street: Wait a sec...
[08/13/2006 08:13 PM] Keifer Street: If I am correct (and I do beleive I am) Christina would have only agreed to take such a picture under certain stipulations...
[08/13/2006 08:13 PM] Keifer Street: ...which would include NOT showing anyone else
[08/13/2006 08:13 PM] Keifer Street: am I right?
[08/13/2006 08:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yes
[08/13/2006 08:13 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i can get that rule amended for the owner of the equipment used
[08/13/2006 08:14 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: so?
[08/13/2006 08:16 PM] Keifer Street: You'd have to have it approved with Christina first
[08/13/2006 08:19 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: well yes of course
[08/13/2006 08:19 PM] Keifer Street: Besides... don't you think that'd be kinda weird for one of your best friend's and roommate's to have seen your gf practically naked/
[08/13/2006 08:19 PM] Keifer Street: ?
[08/13/2006 08:20 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: shes been naked infront of me
[08/13/2006 08:20 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah, duh... I know that much... but how would you feel if a guy that WASN'T her boyfriend to see her that way
[08/13/2006 08:21 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i would stand naked infront of you
[08/13/2006 08:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you wouldn't like it much
[08/13/2006 08:22 PM] Keifer Street: Yes, but you see... I am a MAN and Christina is a WOMAN
[08/13/2006 08:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but say if you caught me without a towel getting out of the shower
[08/13/2006 08:22 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: therefore under the certain 1337 h4x0r gaming circumstances you should be able to see her practically naked
[08/13/2006 08:23 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: linux is so amazing
[08/13/2006 08:23 PM] Keifer Street: why is it so amazing?
[08/13/2006 08:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: you know how when windows copies stuff and it like stalls and counts the files it has to copy and gives you some bullshit estimated time that is never even close, and in between each file it stops pounding the hard drive
[08/13/2006 08:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: linux doesn't do any of that
[08/13/2006 08:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: even over the network there is absolutely no pausing between files, its hard core straight to the point no fucking around, and has a fairly accurate estimated time
[08/13/2006 08:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i g2g get ice cream
[08/13/2006 08:24 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: be back in like 15 minutes
[08/13/2006 08:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh yeah before i go, we are gonna find you a new girlfriend, with Christina and my help you will have so many options you won't know what to do
[08/13/2006 08:25 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: we got you back
[08/13/2006 08:26 PM] Keifer Street: good
[08/13/2006 08:27 PM] Keifer Street: I'm not entirely helpless, either ya know ;) but I'll take all of the offers I can get... the more, the marrier!
[08/13/2006 08:27 PM] Keifer Street: It helps when making a decision... if you have a lot to choose from, you can pick one that suits you best
[08/13/2006 08:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: back
[08/13/2006 08:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: yeah i definitely agree
[08/13/2006 08:39 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: and i don't mean you're helpless, but it's always easier to talk to girls when you have friends around
[08/13/2006 08:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: copying stuff is fun
[08/13/2006 08:40 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: i wish it showed the kilobytes speed of the files being transferred
[08/13/2006 08:43 PM] Keifer Street: I had my 2nd hangover EVER the other day
[08/13/2006 08:43 PM] Keifer Street: it freakin' sucked
[08/13/2006 08:44 PM] Keifer Street: I woke up with a pounding headache, I had a fever, I was extremely nausious, and I threw up twice... it only lasted an hour... but I was miserable in that hour
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] Keifer Street: u still there
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow dude
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: not even worth it
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] Keifer Street: Yeah... I know
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: how much did you drink/
[08/13/2006 08:45 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: were you at a party or at your house?
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: did you make out with any more hot chicks?
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] Keifer Street: I emptied a bottle of Bacardi Rum and 1/4 bottle of J
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] Keifer Street: D
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: at a party?
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: or by yourself?
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: girls?
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] Keifer Street: party... yes girls... I even saw girls making out with other girls
[08/13/2006 08:46 PM] Keifer Street: at my friends house... going away party

[08/13/2006 08:47 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: but i thought of a fairly good way to explain it
[08/13/2006 08:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: its not that lesbianism is right, because the bible says homosexuality is wrong, but the most important thing about it is the lack of cock in the middle
[08/13/2006 08:48 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: because guys don't like other cock, so seeing two lesbians get off together is hot
