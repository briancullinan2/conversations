[08/16/2006 02:49 PM] Christina Sanders: so my dad and i think we've figured out what that pain was
[08/16/2006 02:49 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: what is it?
[08/16/2006 02:52 PM] Christina Sanders: well we think it is a muscle linked to my jaw and the soreness is from my jaw being out of alignment every once in awhile (due to old dental devices i used to have in my mouth) and we think that is what also is causing my headaches
[08/16/2006 02:52 PM] Christina Sanders: and i didn't get that much headaches this summer until you came back
[08/16/2006 02:52 PM] Christina Sanders: and i seriously think kissing you is what started to bother it again
[08/16/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[08/16/2006 02:53 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: guess we have to stop kissing for a whle
[08/16/2006 02:53 PM] Christina Sanders: ya know overextending my jaw
[08/16/2006 02:53 PM] Christina Sanders: no i think it was  my jaw wasn't used to doing that for quite awhile
[08/16/2006 02:54 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: oh
[08/16/2006 02:55 PM] Christina Sanders: ill try to see if i can go to my dentist again
[08/16/2006 02:55 PM] b.cullinan@cox.net: wow i am so bored i am watching teen titans

[08/17/2006 12:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: For sexual massage, see erotic massage. For "massage" as a euphemism for paid sexual favors, see prostitution.''
 Massage is the practice of applying pressure or vibration to the soft tissues of the body, including muscles, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, and joints. A form of therapy, massage can be applied to parts of the body or successively to the whole body, to heal injury, relieve psychological stress, manage pain, improve circulation and relieve tension. Where massage is used for its physical and psychological benefits, it may be termed "therapeutic massage therapy" or manipulative therapy.
 
[08/17/2006 12:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 
 most massage techniques involve the client being treated lying down on a massage table or in a massage chair; though there are a few exceptions, as with Thai massage (see below). Due to the necessary physical contact between the practitioner and the client or patient, care is taken to avoid causing sexual arousal. Although the massage subject is generally unclothed, their body is "draped" with towels or sheets. This also helps keep the patient warm.
 
[08/17/2006 12:23 AM] b.cullinan@cox.net: 
 the genitalia or intimate parts of the body are not touched at all in legitimate therapeutic massage. The treatment may start with the client face up or down for the first part of the session: the client then rolls over (draped by the towels or sheets) for the second half of the session.
