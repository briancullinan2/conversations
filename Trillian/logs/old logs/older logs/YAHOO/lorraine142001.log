[09/27/2005 10:26 PM] lorraine142001: and like 20 hugs.
[09/27/2005 10:27 PM] bjcullinan: want to spend the night?
[09/27/2005 10:28 PM] bjcullinan: i make a bad boyfriend
[09/27/2005 10:28 PM] bjcullinan: you wouldn't want to go out with me
[09/27/2005 10:28 PM] lorraine142001: lol whys that?
[09/27/2005 10:28 PM] bjcullinan: because i can't stay put
[09/27/2005 10:28 PM] lorraine142001: meaning?
[09/27/2005 10:29 PM] bjcullinan: i just like being around friends all the time, including other females
[09/27/2005 10:31 PM] lorraine142001: lol you are strange. ive never had a guy ask me to spend the night and then basically say no for me.
[09/27/2005 10:31 PM] bjcullinan: what?
[09/27/2005 10:31 PM] bjcullinan: oh
[09/27/2005 10:32 PM] bjcullinan: yes i am very strange to
[09/27/2005 10:32 PM] bjcullinan: well it would be fun if you did
[09/27/2005 10:32 PM] bjcullinan: we wouldn't really have to do anything
[09/27/2005 10:32 PM] bjcullinan: but i just want to warn you ahead of time, i would make a bad boyfriend
[09/27/2005 10:32 PM] bjcullinan: if that's what your looking for that is
[09/27/2005 10:33 PM] lorraine142001: lol what are you looking for? thats what im wondering.
[09/27/2005 10:33 PM] bjcullinan: i don't know
[09/27/2005 10:34 PM] bjcullinan: i haven't decided
[09/27/2005 10:37 PM] lorraine142001: lol wow. whys that? whats there to decide about, if you dont mind me asking. 
[09/27/2005 10:38 PM] bjcullinan: because i don't want a girlfriend
[09/27/2005 10:38 PM] bjcullinan: i'd rather be "seeing" someone
[09/27/2005 10:39 PM] bjcullinan: girlfriend boyfriend relationships are pointless
[09/27/2005 10:40 PM] lorraine142001: depends on the definition i guess. im not looking for anything serious myself, but theres no way im going to be a friend with benefits either.
[09/27/2005 10:40 PM] bjcullinan: the only reason for them is so that if someone changes their mind about the person they are with then they have an excuse to "hate" them
[09/27/2005 10:41 PM] bjcullinan: i wouldn't call it friends with benifits
[09/27/2005 10:41 PM] bjcullinan: but i'd rather have that kind of relationship then always be trying to find a way out of one
[09/27/2005 10:44 PM] lorraine142001: hmm you must have had bad relationships in the past. i dont like serious relationships, id rather feel like i am going out with a friend not dating my father (always wondering where i am etc.) that doesnt make it not a relationship to me though, just a different one. my best guy friend in the world is my ex. our relationship was really laid back, no pressure for any commitment. 
[09/27/2005 10:46 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[09/27/2005 10:47 PM] bjcullinan: i had two relationships end really shitty so i figure i am just not a good boyfriend and i don't really want a girlfriend
[09/27/2005 10:47 PM] bjcullinan: i think anything past a friendship is a bonus
[09/27/2005 10:49 PM] bjcullinan: whether that be just affection, or the occasional kiss, or just spending more time together then you would with "just a friend"
[09/27/2005 10:50 PM] bjcullinan: so if i was seeing someone, but i was also attracted to another friend, i would be really open about it, no secrets or anything, i would just let the person(s) know that i am seeing someone else
[09/27/2005 10:52 PM] lorraine142001: so you mean you wouldnt stay loyal to that person but tell them you are seeing two people? lol
[09/27/2005 10:53 PM] bjcullinan: i am the most loyal person to my friend
[09/27/2005 10:53 PM] bjcullinan: s
[09/27/2005 10:53 PM] bjcullinan: so yeah i would always be loyal, especially as a friend
[09/27/2005 10:53 PM] bjcullinan: what do you mean by loyal
[09/27/2005 10:54 PM] lorraine142001: i mean, see two people at the same time?
[09/27/2005 10:54 PM] bjcullinan: so do you have more then two friends?
[09/27/2005 10:56 PM] bjcullinan: i am all for finding that perfect other person and settling down and getting married
[09/27/2005 10:56 PM] bjcullinan: but until i find that person i have the right to search
[09/27/2005 10:57 PM] bjcullinan: so what if i just am trying to hurry the search along a little
[09/27/2005 10:57 PM] bjcullinan: actually that is a pretty crude way of describing this method of dating
[09/27/2005 10:57 PM] bjcullinan: but do you understand what i am saying?
[09/27/2005 10:57 PM] bjcullinan: you have more then two friends
[09/27/2005 10:57 PM] bjcullinan: so what if you want more then just a friendship with both or either?
[09/27/2005 10:58 PM] bjcullinan: like you care about those two people so much
[09/27/2005 10:58 PM] bjcullinan: that you know you would be happy with either
[09/27/2005 10:59 PM] bjcullinan: so instead of going out with one or being in that boyfriend/girlfriend relationship, just progress your relationship with both
[09/27/2005 10:59 PM] bjcullinan: eventually you will have to option to break it off with the other person with minimal emotional pain for both of you
[09/27/2005 10:59 PM] bjcullinan: it makes it easier and more fun for both
[09/27/2005 10:59 PM] bjcullinan: understand?
[09/27/2005 11:00 PM] bjcullinan: please let me know how you feel, i want to be completely honest with you, i don't want to have to play those stupid little dating games
[09/27/2005 11:00 PM] lorraine142001: dude i have been in that situation before but i have enough respect for those two people that i wouldnt let them have the feeling of knowing that they have to share. so its one or the other. 
[09/27/2005 11:01 PM] lorraine142001: i date one person at a time. its not serious but im not going to act like a whore either.
[09/27/2005 11:01 PM] bjcullinan: i understand why you see it that way and i respect you for being considerate, i would never lie about seeing another person
[09/27/2005 11:02 PM] lorraine142001: yeah ive heard that one before. you would if you wanted to still see me and new i wasnt cool with that and would break it off if you were.
[09/27/2005 11:03 PM] bjcullinan: i would ask both people to understand that i am close enough to another friend that it could become more then just a friendship
[09/27/2005 11:03 PM] bjcullinan: ok hypothetically speaking if i asked you out to dinner and a movie and paid would that be considered a date?
[09/27/2005 11:05 PM] lorraine142001: i suppose in a traditional sense. if you did this with other girls it wouldnt be a problem, where the problem comes in is when you get physical.
[09/27/2005 11:05 PM] bjcullinan: so you wouldn't give me a kiss at the end of the night?
[09/27/2005 11:05 PM] bjcullinan: what about a hug?
[09/27/2005 11:06 PM] lorraine142001: not if i knew that all i was was a date, and not any more than the person lined up for the next night.
[09/27/2005 11:06 PM] lorraine142001: a hug yes
[09/27/2005 11:06 PM] bjcullinan: so what if it became a routine
[09/27/2005 11:07 PM] bjcullinan: like we went did something together at least once every weekend?  would that be called dating, or seeing someone?
[09/27/2005 11:09 PM] lorraine142001: depends on who you talk to. id say we were still just friends if it was paid movie dinner, then hug. kiss would be different, yes if it was a kiss.
[09/27/2005 11:09 PM] bjcullinan: i c
[09/27/2005 11:09 PM] bjcullinan: do you like reality shows?
[09/27/2005 11:10 PM] lorraine142001: not really, the only amusement i get from them is laughing at peoples stupidity really.
[09/27/2005 11:10 PM] bjcullinan: remember the bachelor?  how come he is never ridiculed for making out with 20 different girls?
[09/27/2005 11:13 PM] lorraine142001: im not american society. im a person with my own beliefs. im not going to say that its right because others do and it was on television. i dont necessarily care that he did it. i just wouldnt be in that situation. 
[09/27/2005 11:14 PM] bjcullinan: all i am saying is that i think it is better to be seeing someone or more then one person, then to try it, find out that its not going to work out, and have a major heart break
[09/27/2005 11:15 PM] bjcullinan: i love spending time with you, but i also like spending time with other people
[09/27/2005 11:15 PM] lorraine142001: you wont have a heartbreak if you keep it a light relationship.
[09/27/2005 11:16 PM] bjcullinan: if it gets to deep to be seeing other people then i completely believe in breaking it off with the other people and devoting all your attention to that one special person
[09/27/2005 11:20 PM] lorraine142001: i guess that my theory is that if you like more than one person at once then keep it friendly until you decide who to be with. you dont have to kiss and hold hands to be able to decide who to be with, physical affection shouldnt be the basis of the decision. and even if you made the wrong decision you could try a relationship with the other person later. it just seems to messy they way your putting things.
[09/27/2005 11:20 PM] bjcullinan: yeah and it could be
[09/27/2005 11:22 PM] lorraine142001: if your kinda seeing someone and then decide to see only  one, are the others going to want to kinda see you again when you find out you made the wrong decision. not likely. 
[09/27/2005 11:22 PM] bjcullinan: if you can stay friends with them
[09/27/2005 11:22 PM] lorraine142001: maybe
[09/27/2005 11:22 PM] bjcullinan: but that is the problem with going out with them
[09/27/2005 11:22 PM] bjcullinan: because its hard to be friends afterwards
[09/27/2005 11:23 PM] bjcullinan: so if you cut it off before it gets there then there is more of a chance of staying friends
[09/27/2005 11:24 PM] lorraine142001: well if i kiss a guy and he gets a girlfriend, then breaks up and wants to kiss me again i wouldnt want to. most girls i know feel the same way.
[09/27/2005 11:25 PM] bjcullinan: then the guy should know not to kiss you
[09/27/2005 11:25 PM] bjcullinan: if he knows you well enough he wont take it that far
[09/27/2005 11:25 PM] lorraine142001: ok yeah so your just friends. not seeing eachother. if you dont show that kind of affection.
[09/27/2005 11:26 PM] lorraine142001: i dont care if someone im seeing has girls that are his friends, but i do care if hes making out with all kinds of girls besides me. 
[09/27/2005 11:27 PM] bjcullinan: you blowing this out of proportion
[09/27/2005 11:28 PM] lorraine142001: im trying to put it in a way thats easily understandable. i dont believe you understand what im saying. 
[09/27/2005 11:29 PM] lorraine142001: or maybe i dont understand what your saying
[09/27/2005 11:29 PM] bjcullinan: i don't understand what the big attraction to going out with someone is
[09/27/2005 11:32 PM] lorraine142001: its not a fad lol. its not something that people are into right now. going out just means that you have a relationship with someone because you care about them so much you want to be with them. if you dont care about someone that much, dont be with them. i dont go out with random guys just to go out with them. ive had friends that me and them were attracted to eachother but never go out.
[09/27/2005 11:33 PM] bjcullinan: so what if you really care about all of you friends including the opposite sex?
[09/27/2005 11:34 PM] bjcullinan: its not that i don't believe being with one person is a good idea
[09/27/2005 11:34 PM] bjcullinan: you are looking at this from the wrong side
[09/27/2005 11:34 PM] bjcullinan: i would love to just be with one girl all the time
[09/27/2005 11:34 PM] bjcullinan: but until i decide who i want to be with i am going to leave my options open
[09/27/2005 11:35 PM] bjcullinan: there is no reason for me to just pick some girl that i like and am attracted to
[09/27/2005 11:35 PM] bjcullinan: just because you really like some doesn't mean you are still going to like them in a boyfriend girlfriend relationship
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] bjcullinan: so why shouldn't i try to progress on a relationship with a girl
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] lorraine142001: so dont go out with them
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] bjcullinan: i don't plan to
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] lorraine142001: ok
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] bjcullinan: but if the relationship never progresses how would one expect to find out whether it is right or not?
[09/27/2005 11:36 PM] lorraine142001: you can progress emotionally 
[09/27/2005 11:37 PM] bjcullinan: omg, how is that any different
[09/27/2005 11:37 PM] lorraine142001: ive never had a physical relationship with someone that worked without an emotional one.
[09/27/2005 11:38 PM] bjcullinan: just because i gave you a hug, and from what i could tell you hugged me back, does that mean we were illegally progressing our relationship physically?
[09/27/2005 11:38 PM] lorraine142001: no hug is different. i hug friends that are girls. lol
[09/27/2005 11:39 PM] bjcullinan: you're not understanding my point, it is different for guys, i don't hug Eric, what if when we first met i decided that you weren't my type
[09/27/2005 11:39 PM] bjcullinan: do you think i would ask you to come over all the time?  and talk to you online all the time? and give you a hug when we part?
[09/27/2005 11:40 PM] bjcullinan: probably not, sure i have close friends that i hug, but if i wasn't at all attracted to you, i would be paying so much attention to you
[09/27/2005 11:40 PM] bjcullinan: i hardly ever talk to richard and keifer even though they are guys whenever they are around i feel like it is just small talk
[09/27/2005 11:41 PM] bjcullinan: something doesn't match up, so i don't spend as much time with them
[09/27/2005 11:43 PM] bjcullinan: maybe i just haven't met a girl that can change my mind
[09/27/2005 11:45 PM] lorraine142001: ok, i understand. 
[09/27/2005 11:45 PM] lorraine142001: and ill leave it at that.
[09/27/2005 11:45 PM] bjcullinan: that's it?
[09/27/2005 11:46 PM] bjcullinan: you don't want to argue about me not yet finding a girl worth the heartbreak?
[09/27/2005 11:47 PM] lorraine142001: no, my hearts been broken. 
[09/27/2005 11:48 PM] lorraine142001: he wasnt worth it, but i didnt see it until now. i hope your method works and you dont get your heart broken.
[09/27/2005 11:50 PM] bjcullinan: when a girl comes along that convinces me that shes the one i should be devoted to, then i will change, i am a pretty honest person, mom says i "wear my heart on my sleeve" but i haven't found that person yet, so until then i'd prefer to stay available and progress my relationships with people until i find out that its not going anywhere
[09/27/2005 11:54 PM] lorraine142001: well thats fine. you have the right to do things the way you want, i have a different look on it. i dont expect you to understand. im not going to argue with you. i dont like arguing, if i wasnt already so upset i wouldnt have said anything, just that i didnt agree with your method.
[09/27/2005 11:58 PM] lorraine142001: you want me to be 100 percent truthful, tell you something i dont tell anyone?
[09/27/2005 11:59 PM] bjcullinan: ok
[09/27/2005 11:59 PM] bjcullinan: lets here it
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] bjcullinan: what are you upset about?
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] bjcullinan: is it because of me?
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] lorraine142001: dude i lost my phone remember? lol 
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] bjcullinan: that's it?
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] bjcullinan: phones are pretty cheap
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] lorraine142001: hold on 
[09/28/2005 12:00 AM] bjcullinan: its the service that costs money
[09/28/2005 12:01 AM] lorraine142001: im not worried about the actual phone, just my dad
[09/28/2005 12:01 AM] bjcullinan: shit happens dude, it will be alright, i know parents are sometime hard to deal with, but he'll get over it, you might even try calling to company and seeing if you can get anything out of them
[09/28/2005 12:02 AM] bjcullinan: what is this thing you never tell anyone? i hope you trust me enough to tell me
[09/28/2005 12:10 AM] lorraine142001: thats it. i trust too much. see the thing is that i do like you. im not saying i want anything serious, just an attraction, i like hanging out with you. but i have been so taken advantage of the trust i give (i say give because my mother thinks trust should be earned, i seem to have an innocent until proven guilty policy) that all the people that really care about me have all warned me, especially now that im in college and away from them all, not just family but friends and teachers too have warned and warned and are worried so much about me trusting too easily that i immediately took your method to be a lie, a justification on just wanting a  sexual relationship. its happened to me before. i could say more about it but its not something im proud of or easy for me to even elude to. 
[09/28/2005 12:10 AM] lorraine142001: thats why i argued.
[09/28/2005 12:11 AM] lorraine142001: i hope that makes sense to you.
[09/28/2005 12:12 AM] bjcullinan: it does
[09/28/2005 12:12 AM] bjcullinan: i am not trying to lie, that is something i'd never do, i just want an open relationship with people
[09/28/2005 12:15 AM] bjcullinan: i need sleep
[09/28/2005 12:15 AM] bjcullinan: goodnight

[10/24/2005 12:33 AM] Andrea Flannagan: she was on her way home from work and something fell off the dash and she looked to see what it was and when she looked back there was something in the road so she swerved to miss it and hit some gravel.

[10/24/2005 12:34 AM] Andrea Flannagan: yep, it ended up being a rabbit
