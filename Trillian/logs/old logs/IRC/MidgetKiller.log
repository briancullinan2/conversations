[02/13/2005 07:03 PM] MidgetKiller: hi, sorry, was away watching tv
[02/13/2005 07:08 PM] MidgetKiller: right now it's kinda hard to get people interested in playing on any server... just the game doesn't have as much popularity as it used to.
[02/13/2005 07:08 PM] MidgetKiller: You're not the only one that has a server with low player count.
[02/13/2005 07:09 PM] MidgetKiller: I'm hoping that when ETUT comes out, it will re-vitalize the community, and spark more interest into Urban Terror.
[02/13/2005 07:10 PM] MidgetKiller: I'm going through the same problem with my site... used to average 500 to 700 visitors a day when it first opened nearly 2 years ago, but now it's only around 150 to 300 a day.
[02/13/2005 07:10 PM] MidgetKiller: You could always try running some sort of special event, like a competition or something.
[02/13/2005 07:16 PM] WG_Wise_Master: ok
[02/13/2005 07:17 PM] MidgetKiller: if you come up with some sort of contest / competition, and you need any publicity, let me know. I'd be happy to help that way. I have admin access on deadllamas.net, and on my site map-depot.com
[02/13/2005 07:17 PM] WG_Wise_Master: ok
[02/13/2005 07:17 PM] WG_Wise_Master: come play on UrbanRevival
[02/13/2005 07:17 PM] WG_Wise_Master: Rommel
[02/13/2005 07:19 PM] MidgetKiller: i can't... dialup whore
[02/13/2005 07:19 PM] WG_Wise_Master: oh
