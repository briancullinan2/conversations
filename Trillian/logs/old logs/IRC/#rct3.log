[06/27/2005 11:34 AM] Mark: [11:01] EventServices: <notPyros> RCT made a dramatic change between 2 and 3, going from 2D to 3D. Do you forsee any large innovations to the genre or changes in future games, or was that strictly a change to fit in with the 3D generation?
[06/27/2005 11:34 AM] Mark: [11:03] David: It was indeed a dramatic change, but there are still many more things we can do in the future. I guess you're fishing for what we might do in RCT4 - but that is not yet decide
[06/27/2005 11:34 AM] Mark: does that mean there will be an RCT4 :O
