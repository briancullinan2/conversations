[10/17/2005 09:34 PM] jqibfmg: [ 4 ] 10/19/05 - Starting in 1999 ETG burst onto the scene and became the Main Chat Network for the Quake Series in the western hemisphere. With some of our recent additions we are now offering more options to clans then ever before. Our NEW Scrim/War services for example, enable us to bring features to the Quake DM/CTF community it has NEVER had at its finger tips before.
[10/17/2005 09:34 PM] jqibfmg: [ 5 ] 10/19/05 - If you are the chanadmin for your clan, we invite you to check it out, type " !set scriminfo " in your chan when authed. It will take you less than 3 min to setup. Once setup, you or others in your clan, can request a war/scrim from other clans by typing a simple command, a process which takes less then a min. It sends to all other clans who play that game/mod in your area that might be interested!
[10/17/2005 09:34 PM] jqibfmg: [ 6 ] 10/19/05 - Beyond the new scrim system, we are also relaunching our Quake 4 website it has all of the current information regarding Quake 4 with links to every major news item about the game so you don't have to go searching.
