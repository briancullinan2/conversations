[06/08/2006 08:31 PM] ChanServ:  As you may have noticed ETG has been undergoing some attacks the past couple days which has been causing some downtime. The people doing this are criminals, and are causing quite a bit of damages to a number of companies. As a result of breaking a number of major laws, they deserve to face the consequences for their actions. This isn't a game for us, this is costing real money and real time for real people.
[06/08/2006 08:31 PM] ChanServ:  So, we are looking into opening cases with both the FBI and the AFP to deal with it. As we go through this tough period, we really could use your help to bring it to a permanent and speedy stop. We are looking for any identifying information you have on any of the following people. Any information from Real Names, Postal Addresses, Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, AIM/MSN/ICQ #s, MySpace pages.
[06/08/2006 08:31 PM] ChanServ:  Basically anything that will aid in tracking them down and identifying them in real life. Also any evidence you may have of them attacking us or info of other illegal activity they are involved with would also be most appreciated. The people we are looking for information on are: Damier, daddycool / dcz, Anixion, Serra, PwNz, XoC, xeron, [iDH]risker, [iDH]HaHa, and any other iDH members.
