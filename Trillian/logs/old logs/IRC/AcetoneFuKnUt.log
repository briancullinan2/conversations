[01/12/2005 11:04 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: should breath new life and increase the player base significantly
[01/12/2005 11:04 PM] WG_Wise_Master: theres only like 300 servers, not even, compared to half life and expansions, over 50,000 servers

Session Start (WG_Wise_Master:Acetone|FuKnUt): Wed Jan 12 23:13:47 2005
[01/12/2005 11:13 PM] WG_Wise_Master: oh yeah one more thing
[01/12/2005 11:14 PM] WG_Wise_Master: would it be to much to ask to send me the map cycle you use?
[01/12/2005 11:14 PM] WG_Wise_Master: because on some maps servers have different flag points, and i don't know how to do that
[01/12/2005 11:14 PM] WG_Wise_Master: for example on shAbbey2
[01/12/2005 11:15 PM] WG_Wise_Master: if you want to do me that favor my e-mail is b.cullinan@cox.net
[01/12/2005 11:15 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: no such thing
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] WG_Wise_Master: what?
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: maps are uniform on all server
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] WG_Wise_Master: changing the flag points?
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: you can't change flag points in UT
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] WG_Wise_Master: hmmm what about spawn points?
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: nope
[01/12/2005 11:16 PM] WG_Wise_Master: that's weird because on my server when people spawn it isn't always in the same place
[01/12/2005 11:17 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: it's random in various spawn points, but it's not a server setting
[01/12/2005 11:18 PM] WG_Wise_Master: oh, i thought it was
[01/12/2005 11:18 PM] WG_Wise_Master: thanks for clearing that up
[01/12/2005 11:18 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: there are certain maps that have spawn rooms ie. docks and rommel
[01/12/2005 11:18 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: and others too
[01/12/2005 11:18 PM] WG_Wise_Master: yeah
[01/12/2005 11:22 PM] WG_Wise_Master: you wouldn't happen to know how to turn off a "Second Half" would you?
[01/12/2005 11:22 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: crap i forget
[01/12/2005 11:22 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: should be off be default
[01/12/2005 11:23 PM] WG_Wise_Master: i can't find it in my server config, but it does it anyways
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: it's in the manual somewhere
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: either i can look it up or you can
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] WG_Wise_Master: which manual?
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: guess who will?
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: :)
[01/12/2005 11:24 PM] WG_Wise_Master: urt?
[01/12/2005 11:25 PM] WG_Wise_Master: me?
[01/12/2005 11:25 PM] Acetone|FuKnUt: ahahahah yes
