[12/04/2005 08:06 PM] Richard Lesder: oooh

[12/04/2005 08:06 PM] Richard Lesder: i see
[12/04/2005 08:07 PM] Richard Lesder: can you have settings based on the genral weather? like raining and stuff
[12/04/2005 08:07 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that's on the right
[12/04/2005 08:07 PM] bjcullinan: change the option to Weather or Both
[12/04/2005 08:07 PM] Richard Lesder: oh the type one
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] Richard Lesder: do you like type 'rain' into the type? or 'Rain' or is there a Rain constant?
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] bjcullinan: mmm i don't know all of them
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] bjcullinan: it is Fair now
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] bjcullinan: it would probably be Rainy
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] bjcullinan: with a capital
[12/04/2005 08:09 PM] bjcullinan: or Raining
[12/04/2005 08:12 PM] Richard Lesder: gocha
[12/04/2005 08:13 PM] bjcullinan: you will just have to wait until it rains
[12/04/2005 08:13 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah i guess so
[12/04/2005 08:13 PM] Richard Lesder: or go to weather.com and see if i can find a key
[12/04/2005 08:13 PM] bjcullinan: make a new image every day the weather condition changes
[12/04/2005 08:14 PM] Richard Lesder: wow, its strange when you set the background as the weatherdesktop.bmp

[12/04/2005 08:56 PM] bjcullinan: semi transparent?
[12/04/2005 08:57 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah, you know, alpha values between 0-255 insted of a boolean
[12/04/2005 08:57 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[12/04/2005 08:58 PM] bjcullinan: in which part? on the images?

[12/04/2005 08:58 PM] bjcullinan: yeah it does
[12/04/2005 08:58 PM] bjcullinan: it draws the transparencies for PNG files
[12/04/2005 08:58 PM] Richard Lesder: oooh pngs. let me try taht
[12/04/2005 08:58 PM] bjcullinan: or gifs
[12/04/2005 08:59 PM] bjcullinan: jpgs don't support transparencies

[12/04/2005 09:36 PM] Richard Lesder: ya know what would be really handy?
[12/04/2005 09:36 PM] bjcullinan: what?
[12/04/2005 09:37 PM] Richard Lesder: horizon offsets.  so you could choose at what hight the lowest gradient color is.  im using an image with a higher horizon than yours, and so its getting to be a pain trying to reajust the colors so i can see more than just the top 2-3 colors
[12/04/2005 09:37 PM] bjcullinan: ahh yes
[12/04/2005 09:37 PM] bjcullinan: good idea
[12/04/2005 09:38 PM] Richard Lesder: yup yup, also if you put a place to just enter a hex code into the program insted of using the color picker that would be a nice easy thingy too
[12/04/2005 09:53 PM] bjcullinan: oh yeah good idea
[12/04/2005 09:55 PM] Richard Lesder: also a few small things just to make event creation faster: default to greater than at 0, 0 (Offset time) AND less than 0, 0 (Offset time), with date set to none (that confused me, because it dosnt register your event if the day isnt set to something
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] bjcullinan: i'll make those changes right away
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] Richard Lesder: w00t
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] bjcullinan: the hardest one will be the offset
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] bjcullinan: should it be picture specific or general?
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah i was thinking that too
[12/04/2005 09:58 PM] Richard Lesder: id make it per time slot
[12/04/2005 09:59 PM] bjcullinan: how do you mean?
[12/04/2005 09:59 PM] bjcullinan: per event?
[12/04/2005 10:01 PM] Richard Lesder: well i was refering to the offset for the color gradiants, so i figured it would be related to the 7:00 AM and such
[12/04/2005 10:03 PM] bjcullinan: well yeah but you can already change the 5 colors per time of day
[12/04/2005 10:03 PM] bjcullinan: but should the offset be different for every available picture?
[12/04/2005 10:04 PM] Richard Lesder: thats true
[12/04/2005 10:04 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah you could put it next to the picture thingy
[12/04/2005 10:04 PM] Richard Lesder: in the events
[12/04/2005 10:19 PM] Richard Lesder: sweet, im finished with the clear day cycle

[12/05/2005 02:12 PM] bjcullinan: ok ttyl
[12/05/2005 02:13 PM] Richard Lesder: make sure your limiting your gradients so they dont try to gradient past the mark, that might be the problem, were a single pixle width causes a change in color past target

[01/08/2006 10:25 PM] bjcullinan: When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they quickly discovered that ball-point pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 billion developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside-down, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C. 
  
 the Russians used a pencil. Your taxes are due again--enjoy paying them.

[01/09/2006 02:26 PM] Richard Lesder: sweet its downloading, i figure im probably gona have to redo a batch of settings huh? or cleverly cut and paste from your setting files
[01/09/2006 02:27 PM] bjcullinan: yeah the settings file did change significantly
[01/09/2006 02:27 PM] bjcullinan: were you using the advanced events for pictures?
[01/09/2006 02:27 PM] Richard Lesder: probably
[01/09/2006 02:27 PM] Richard Lesder: actualy i was lazy and never did anything involving weather, only time right now
[01/09/2006 02:28 PM] bjcullinan: yeah you'll have to redo those probably i don't think you have the version with the new date ranges
[01/09/2006 02:28 PM] Richard Lesder: hmm i think i had the date ranges, i remembered having to disable them
[01/09/2006 02:28 PM] bjcullinan: i was thinking just supplying a whole bunch of pictures with the program and instructions on how to make your own, and makes some preset advanced settings
[01/09/2006 02:29 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah i could see alot of nice 'horizon pack' wizards coming in handy
[01/09/2006 02:45 PM] bjcullinan: yeah but i need pictures
[01/09/2006 02:45 PM] bjcullinan: then i need to edit every one
[01/09/2006 02:45 PM] bjcullinan: and they have to be high quality

[01/18/2006 03:45 PM] bjcullinan: we have an emulator CD
[01/18/2006 03:45 PM] Richard Lesder: yeah, you would need a binary conversion thingy, it would be slow, but for small programs it would be cool
[01/18/2006 03:45 PM] bjcullinan: that has like 20 different ones
[01/18/2006 03:45 PM] Richard Lesder: oh cool, ff6?

[02/23/2006 02:12 AM] bjcullinan: hey
[02/23/2006 02:12 AM] Richard Lesder: yo
[02/23/2006 02:12 AM] bjcullinan: i decided that i will not remove the pictures because i have the ability to find the beauty in every photograph, however naughty movies are completely intended to be stimulating and could actually lead me to sin
[02/23/2006 02:13 AM] Richard Lesder: i see
[02/23/2006 02:13 AM] Richard Lesder: yeah movies are definantly no good
[02/23/2006 02:15 AM] bjcullinan: but although some people make find the pictures stimulating despite there intent which i completely disregard, there is always artistic value, the was every picture looks so perfect, so peaceful and calm, it is the human body in its most natural state without the superficial clothing that dictates such a large part of our society
[02/23/2006 02:17 AM] bjcullinan: can you imagine what we have become, the t-shirts we wear are an example of being a poor college student, when i man dresses in a suit and tie he is considered appropriately dressed to go to a desk job, a man in robes is considered holy, a man in orange stripes is a prisoner, how does any of this make sense?
[02/23/2006 02:17 AM] Richard Lesder:  alright, well if you sure you can consistantly ignore the intent than thats cool, though i advise you that if you are ever looking at a picture and feel that gut feeling 'delete this' that you dont hesitate
[02/23/2006 02:18 AM] bjcullinan: our clothing today reflects our status in society, but then the absence of clothing considered inappropriate when it is most natural, any person from any part of society can model and the viewer would never be able to tell where that person came from
[02/23/2006 02:18 AM] bjcullinan: that is what i see
[02/23/2006 02:20 AM] bjcullinan: natural beauty
[02/23/2006 02:20 AM] Richard Lesder: thats good, its imporant to see people apart from what society places on them
[02/23/2006 02:20 AM] Richard Lesder: just be careful, because that natural beauty can be perverted
[02/23/2006 02:20 AM] bjcullinan: yes i know
[02/23/2006 02:21 AM] bjcullinan: but i have turned away from that as a part of my acceptance of jesus, i will not let the pictures i keep be used in vain
[02/23/2006 02:21 AM] bjcullinan: its sort of a test for myself and my will and self control
[02/23/2006 02:22 AM] Richard Lesder: :)
[02/23/2006 02:22 AM] bjcullinan: thank you, both of you for being there for me
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] bjcullinan: let keifer know i am thankful
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] Richard Lesder: we are glad to help.  Its amazing to see how far you've come in christ
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] bjcullinan: and i will explain why i don't believe in theft of movies and software
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] bjcullinan: tomorrow
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] Richard Lesder: hehe alright
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] bjcullinan: to both of you
[02/23/2006 02:23 AM] Richard Lesder: i look forward to it
[02/23/2006 02:24 AM] bjcullinan: i think i have a pretty good argument, so we will see if there is anything you can extract from the bible that disproves it
[02/23/2006 02:24 AM] Richard Lesder: hehe, dont worry, im resourceful
[02/23/2006 02:24 AM] Richard Lesder: i gotta get some sleep here

[03/13/2006 05:36 PM] bjcullinan: its quite a bit different
[03/13/2006 05:37 PM] bjcullinan: i'm fairly sure that everything that i moved is actually movable
[03/13/2006 05:37 PM] Richard Lester: I want the corner next to your desk!
[03/13/2006 05:37 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that's what i was planning on
[03/13/2006 05:38 PM] bjcullinan: and i was actually thinking about not using that table, either moving it, or stacking food stuffs in that whole corner
[03/13/2006 05:38 PM] bjcullinan: show keifer before he leaves
[03/13/2006 05:38 PM] Richard Lester: oh he just busted out.. sorry
[03/13/2006 05:38 PM] bjcullinan: well then i will have to print it
[03/13/2006 05:38 PM] Richard Lester: we should put the table in the bedroom
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] Richard Lester: that way we can use that room for study/sleep
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: or show him in a little while
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: yeah that would work
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: like in the middle maybe
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] Richard Lester: yeah
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: i don't think everything is to scale because in the 3d view the table looks smaller
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] Richard Lester: we could also use to to play cards or crap like that
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: feel free to make changes and send it back to me
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] bjcullinan: yeah definitely
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] Richard Lester: yeah the beds in the reilly blueprint is bizzar
[03/13/2006 05:39 PM] Richard Lester: they are fat and stuff
[03/13/2006 05:40 PM] bjcullinan: we should find someone that lives there and make sure everything is moveable
[03/13/2006 05:40 PM] bjcullinan: well i g2g
[03/13/2006 05:41 PM] bjcullinan: but that is basically what i was thinking i spent a little bit of time arranging that
[03/13/2006 05:41 PM] bjcullinan: ttyl
[03/13/2006 05:41 PM] Richard Lester: ok
