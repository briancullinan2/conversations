[08/28/2005 03:51 PM] bjcullinan: looks fine to me
[08/28/2005 03:52 PM] azdbacksluvr: She tried to update the ASU page and uploaded it, and then the form disappeared.  So I guess she uploaded the old file.
[08/28/2005 03:52 PM] azdbacksluvr: Now the updates aren't there
[08/28/2005 03:53 PM] azdbacksluvr: can't have both i guess
[08/28/2005 03:55 PM] bjcullinan: well i fixed the form and updated it
[08/28/2005 03:55 PM] bjcullinan: so she destroyed something that included the form
[08/28/2005 03:55 PM] azdbacksluvr: I guess she will have to figure out how to edit and not lose the form
[08/28/2005 03:55 PM] bjcullinan: which i don't understand why because i told her spacifically to not delete any of the text
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] bjcullinan: she deleted code that included the form
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] azdbacksluvr: Maybe the right version of the website would be good?  She thought she may have been using the wrong pages
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] bjcullinan: *sigh*
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] azdbacksluvr: she said she didn't touch the form
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] bjcullinan: she was using the right page
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] bjcullinan: she just deleted code
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] azdbacksluvr: she uploaded and it was gone
[08/28/2005 03:56 PM] bjcullinan: so i replaced it with the one that had the form

[11/06/2005 02:22 PM] bjcullinan: find it?
[11/06/2005 02:22 PM] azdbacksluvr: i'll try in a minute
[11/06/2005 02:22 PM] bjcullinan: i sent them an e-mail notifying them of this issue
[11/06/2005 02:23 PM] bjcullinan: the problem is that you have a high contrast monitor therefor the color of the scroll bar and the background blend together, any web designer would know this, and therefore their page designer should be fired and replaced by me
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] bjcullinan: but i didn't put that last part in the e-mail
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] azdbacksluvr: there is no scroll bar, but i think i found the spot
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] bjcullinan: they should know better then to make a scroll bar such a similar color
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] bjcullinan: there should be a scroll bar it just matched the color of the background
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] bjcullinan: your using internet explorer right?
[11/06/2005 02:24 PM] azdbacksluvr: yes
[11/06/2005 02:25 PM] bjcullinan: yeah internet explorer supports the scroll bar colors, so web designers can change the color of the scroll bar

[01/22/2006 02:06 PM] bjcullinan: yeah
[01/22/2006 02:08 PM] azdbacksluvr: what happens if you pretend you don't know the rule and stay in calculus
[01/22/2006 02:09 PM] bjcullinan: not sure
[01/22/2006 02:09 PM] bjcullinan: they probably find out at the end of the semester and hold my grade
[01/22/2006 02:09 PM] azdbacksluvr: has your instuctor said anything
[01/22/2006 02:09 PM] azdbacksluvr: yea, but if you get better than a C how can they complain

[02/21/2006 08:37 AM] azdbacksluvr: what now?
[02/21/2006 08:38 AM] bjcullinan: he's mad at me from last night because he was getting mad at the video game and he kept turning around every second, so i said "maybe you can't beat it because you can't concentrate on it for more then 5 minutes" and he automatically assumed i was talking about him talking to brianna so he told me to shut the fuck up and wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night, he told other people that came in to shut up to
[02/21/2006 08:39 AM] azdbacksluvr: you just gotta let it go, and ignore him
[02/21/2006 08:39 AM] bjcullinan: if it was gods will to be friends with he sure has given me a tedious task
[02/21/2006 08:40 AM] azdbacksluvr: yea, I think you gotta give up trying

[02/21/2006 08:40 AM] azdbacksluvr: have a good day.
[02/21/2006 08:40 AM] bjcullinan: later on he brought it up again and he asked tony for some tool
[02/21/2006 08:40 AM] bjcullinan: he said he wanted to kill me with it
[02/21/2006 08:41 AM] bjcullinan: he said the world would be better off
[02/21/2006 08:41 AM] azdbacksluvr: great, just what I like to hear
[02/21/2006 08:41 AM] bjcullinan: and i told him "no Eric, unlike you i have friends that care about me" and he said he didn't care that he doesn't have any friends
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] azdbacksluvr: what a jerk
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] azdbacksluvr: he is going to end up like his dad at this pace
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] bjcullinan: probably
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] azdbacksluvr: don't ever tell him i said that
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] bjcullinan: i know
[02/21/2006 08:42 AM] bjcullinan: i sent him a long series of messages explaining to him how i felt
[02/21/2006 08:43 AM] azdbacksluvr: did he respond
[02/21/2006 08:43 AM] bjcullinan: no only with silence
[02/21/2006 08:43 AM] azdbacksluvr: then you have tried enough
[02/21/2006 08:43 AM] bjcullinan: yes
[02/21/2006 08:44 AM] bjcullinan: my stupid CS teacher lost my last project
[02/21/2006 08:44 AM] azdbacksluvr: did you send it again?
[02/21/2006 08:44 AM] bjcullinan: we print it out and turn it in
[02/21/2006 08:44 AM] azdbacksluvr: so you had it to turn in again
[02/21/2006 08:44 AM] bjcullinan: i will print it out and show him wednesday
[02/21/2006 08:45 AM] bjcullinan: no i didn't know he lost it until yesterday and next class is tomorrow
[02/21/2006 08:45 AM] azdbacksluvr: i c
[02/21/2006 08:45 AM] bjcullinan: he checked his grade book to and it wasn't there
[02/21/2006 08:45 AM] bjcullinan: but i have someone to vouch for me, we were comparing before class started
[02/21/2006 08:45 AM] azdbacksluvr: are you getting an A
[02/21/2006 08:46 AM] bjcullinan: i will use him and the logic that i already have the next project done yesterday so there is no way i could completely write an entire 2 programs and do the homework proving that i must have had the previous one done ontime
[02/21/2006 08:46 AM] bjcullinan: yes i'm getting an A
[02/21/2006 08:47 AM] azdbacksluvr: yea ha

[02/21/2006 08:50 AM] bjcullinan: hmmm
