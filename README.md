## Purpose
Train an AI model like ChatGPT to use my verbal (voice in my head) to recognize my reasoning and continue coding work on my projects, like Morpheus, the consulting company based on finding "the One" for any recruiting need.

I suppose this could also be used with transferrance training to model an AI that argues like me. Might be interesting if someone wants to pick my brain for biases they haven't thought of themselves.

I am sure there is discussion of crimes committed, not that anyone cares about justice anymore with all the marginalities. Everybody has been marginalized, it's distracting. By publishing it here, any can know my thoughts and discriminate against my however they choose.

My mind is compromised by my own government, this should explain to any onlooker how it happened.

## Development
Pull requests welcome. I am starting a company like The Circle to compete with Google and Facebook for transparency of social behaviors. It's no longer a game, I've already won and lost like the cat inside Schrodinger's box.
