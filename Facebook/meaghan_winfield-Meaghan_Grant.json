I was also planning on bringing a lot of alcohol, and if you don't mind, some cool colored jello shots in the most science-y containers I can find. I've also been working on recipes for drunken gummy bears, so if you want I can make a huge batch of those. I know they make cool gummy shapes like worms/bugs/other things which might kind of fit with the science theme. \n\nLet me know if you're okay with that.\n\n-Meaghan\n"

And even a 5 dollar donate helps, Leah and I spent a ton of money and we are working out some experiments for the party, it should be pretty amazing!\n"
