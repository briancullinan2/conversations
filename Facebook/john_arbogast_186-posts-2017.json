We are in the process of creating a list of Veterans that would be interested in spending a few days at our outdoor facility in 2018. We have plenty of waters to fish that are wild and stocked trout and the area has plenty outdoor activities near and this is just a great place to have a get-away and relax, All you need to bring is your clothes everything else is furnished. Just send us a private message include your Name, Phone #, Address, Branch of service and we will add you to the list. We have many contacts at the VA hospitals but we want to keep increasing our contacts to allow more veterans to enjoy the facility. Thank You and we look forward to meeting you.
