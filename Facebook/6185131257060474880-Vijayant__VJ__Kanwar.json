When I was in middle school, I was the kid in the back of math class writing programs on my TI-83/89 and using software to generate graphs.  I am on the job hunt and would love to connect if you think you have a need for a senior software developer.  I have spent the last year writing an iOS app in Swift.  I have spent the last 17 years writing all kind of software, server and web.  Thank you!",
