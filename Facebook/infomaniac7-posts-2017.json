It's simple, just register and click 'Sign This Petition'. Software is the only thing that is covered by both copyright and patents. A patent is designed to protect tangible innovations while copyright is designed to protect ideas.  Software Patents are a burden on the patent office who is obligated to churn out thousands of them every year. They are a burden on the legal system who must process thousands of incomprehensible legal suits. They are a burden on businesses that may not even produce software:   http://www.nytimes.com/…/ford-sued-over-patents-for-sync-co…  Just like taxes as they trickle down the hierarchy, one way or another, software patents are ultimately a burden on you too.",

I'll admit I too was guilty of this and drag the room cleaning on for 1-2 days or until mom threatened the garbage bag and we would never see those toys again.

        "description": "Clare Hagearty Willis Finally the semester is over. And it really isn't that anyone said I couldn't do it, its just that I knew how hard it was going to be and I wasn't sure  I could do it. Nevertheless I showed up everyday and found some friends who helped me along.  Jason Travis   Josh Sommers   Antonio Rios  (The Great),        It Couldn’t Be Done  (Edgar Guest)  Somebody said that it couldn’t be done,      But, he with a chuckle replied  That \"maybe it couldn’t,\" but he would be one      Who wouldn’t say so till he’d tried.  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin      On his face. If he worried he hid it.  He started to sing as he tackled the thing      That couldn’t be done, and he did it.  Somebody scoffed: \"Oh, you’ll never do that;      At least no one has done it\";  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,      And the first thing we knew he’d begun it.  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,      Without any doubting or quiddit,  He started to sing as he tackled the thing      That couldn’t be done, and he did it.  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,      There are thousands to prophesy failure;  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,      The dangers that wait to assail you.  But just buckle it in with a bit of a grin,      Just take off your coat and go to it;  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing      That \"couldn’t be done,\" and you’ll do it. Clare",

L. UPDATE FROM COMMENTS  While the majority of protestors are peaceful, seems there are some groups who are purposefully escalating — just like when civil rights leaders MLK Jr. and Gandhi held to nonviolence while other activists escalated beyond their vision. The goal of this post is discussion, and special thanks to Todd Sheldon, Francine Doe, Aj Baginski, Stacy Ashley, Bob Doug and others in the comments who are ensuring the full picture is shared.
