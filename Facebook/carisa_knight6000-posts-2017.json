        "description": "Today is \"Puppy Mill Free AZ\" Day, a day to remember that puppy mill dogs are allowed to be sold in Arizona, that their parents will live their entire lives in small crates in terrible conditions, and that nothing will change if nothing is done. In the last three years, AAWL has rescued almost 100 dogs from puppy mills, and worked tirelessly to make them healthy and find homes. We fought to stop the import of puppy mill dogs for sale into this state, but our legislature voted against us, and against those animals.  Go to  Puppy Mill Free Arizona   to learn how you can help.",

I'll admit that I'm always shocked when a client comes back to me telling me that their doctor told them that they (or their child) needs to consume dairy for calcium.   Really? How outdated is that information?!  Don't get me wrong, I'm not so black and white to say that dairy, in different forms, is not well processed and possibly even healthful for some, select, individuals. But for many of us, it results in a physiological cascade of issues from blood sugar, to immune, to digestive, to neurological, to hormonal disruption -- not to mention the acne and skin issues that can ensue. (I sure wish someone had told me this when I was a teen!)  And calcium? Seriously?  Calcium levels are much more complex than anything that can be solved with a glass of milk, as evidenced by this massive new study:   http://bit.ly/1NzhSME    Be sure to understand the biochemistry of calcium metabolism before pouring milk on the fire with your clients and patients. Please. Rachel Charlotte Louise Walker",

He is very friendly and used to being indoors as well as outdoors and was very loved. Unfortunately his crowing does not fall within the guidelines of the zoning rules for his Phoenix area home. I think he will be very happy here. We have about 5 other Silkie breeds here as well as other small breeds he will love to hang out and search for bugs in the garden with. He will also attend therapy visits to the care homes when we take our other hens and roosters for lap snuggles with the elderly.",

        "description": "Got pulled over for a random d.o.t. inspection this morning. No big deal, nothing to hide and no worries about passing. Had to reach into my center console to get my insurance and registration papers, which were sitting underneath my concealed carry. With both hands on the wheel I told the officer that I was licensed to carry and in order to give him my papers I would have to move my firearm and h ... ow would he like me to proceed. He thanked me for being upfront about everything and asked me to slowly open the console with my right hand while my left hand remained on the wheel. I did just that. He leaned in a bit and acknowledged that he could see my firearm. He then instructed me to slide the firearm enough to be able to get the envelope I needed. I did just that. He asked me to close the console. I did just that. He thanked me for my respect and responsibility.  We carried on with our business. When it was said and done his last words to me were of thanks and he wished ME a safe day. I was a little taken back and said, Sir with all that's going on in the country today, allow me to wish YOU a safe day, and I thanked him for his service. The moral of the story...attitude and respect are 2 way streets, this officer could have handled the situation completely different given all of the recent events. My thanks and respect go out to all in Law Enforcement!   See More",

Project Regeneration variety spotlight: The Boitano Sweet Red onion has been passed down through the Italian family of David Cavagnaro’s grandmother, Mary (Boitano) Cavagnaro. Her family has grown it since at least the 1920s. David, a Seed Savers Exchange adviser and former farm manager, shared the seed with us in 1988. The onion's exact origin is unclear, but David suspects that Mary's parents, John and Rosa Boitano, brought it with them when they emigrated from Genoa, Italy in the 1870s and settled in California. Seeds like this variety are heirlooms - worthy of being preserved and shared, which is what we are working to do. You can help by supporting Project Regeneration. Your donation ensures varieties like the Boitano Sweet Red onion will be grown by future generations. Donate:  seedsavers.org/regenerate",

Charlotte enjoyed the experience so much that this year she asked her guests to do the same thing for her 5th birthday (her parents have never been more proud). Her donations have doubled since last year and so has her smile. She even got to give one of the toys she donated to Judo, a current shelter pup! Thank you Charlotte for your on-going support and we look forward to watching you grow up to become a future animal advocate!",

Project Regeneration variety spotlight: The Boitano Sweet Red onion has been passed down through the Italian family of David Cavagnaro’s grandmother, Mary (Boitano) Cavagnaro. Her family has grown it since at least the 1920s. David, a Seed Savers Exchange adviser and former farm manager, shared the seed with us in 1988. The onion's exact origin is unclear, but David suspects that Mary's parents, John and Rosa Boitano, brought it with them when they emigrated from Genoa, Italy in the 1870s and settled in California. Seeds like this variety are heirlooms - worthy of being preserved and shared, which is what we are working to do. You can help by supporting Project Regeneration. Your donation ensures varieties like the Boitano Sweet Red onion will be grown by future generations. Donate:  seedsavers.org/regenerate",

        "description": "What a day with this goat pen. The missionaries removed the old pen so we could put up the new pen. We got the idea to use the tractor to scoop out the mush. The tractor got stuck in the mush, then I got it unstuck, went to dump some mush into the dumpster and missed the dumpster. oy. We welcome any volunteers who want to come work hard with finishing this project after the rain clears next week.  ... It will entail scooping our some stinky mush that you see in the pen, onto the tractor pail so I can unload it. Also there are 3 more panels of new fencing to put up. Each panel weighs about 100 pounds. These boys worked hard today for a few hours, and wont be able to come back until next week sometime. It is a stinky job, and a strenuous job. If you want to burn some Christmas Cookie calories, then this is the job for you! Message me for details if interested. I am looking to have this done early next week if possible. The missionaries got a nice head start on it and made an enormous pile that is ready to be removed. There will be about a truckbed load full or two more that needs to go! Then fresh straw can be placed down.   See More",

Max is the first fur baby my husband and I adopted as our first son.  He is not feeling well, and I need to spend every minute I can with him. If I am not posting much over the next few days, this is why. I ask that no visitors come over the next few days for tours as I will be too distracted. It is so hard to see a family member get old. Whether human on furry.",

He is very friendly and used to being indoors as well as outdoors and was very loved. Unfortunately his crowing does not fall within the guidelines of the zoning rules for his Phoenix area home. I think he will be very happy here. We have about 5 other Silkie breeds here as well as other small breeds he will love to hang out and search for bugs in the garden with. He will also attend therapy visits to the care homes when we take our other hens and roosters for lap snuggles with the elderly.",

Project Regeneration variety spotlight: The Boitano Sweet Red onion has been passed down through the Italian family of David Cavagnaro’s grandmother, Mary (Boitano) Cavagnaro. Her family has grown it since at least the 1920s. David, a Seed Savers Exchange adviser and former farm manager, shared the seed with us in 1988. The onion's exact origin is unclear, but David suspects that Mary's parents, John and Rosa Boitano, brought it with them when they emigrated from Genoa, Italy in the 1870s and settled in California. Seeds like this variety are heirlooms - worthy of being preserved and shared, which is what we are working to do. You can help by supporting Project Regeneration. Your donation ensures varieties like the Boitano Sweet Red onion will be grown by future generations. Donate:  seedsavers.org/regenerate",

This brought back an incredible email we received from a cancer patient who had watched Cereal Killers and chose a similar route - successfully - back in 2013. He wrote to thank us but the reality is it's not possible to claim any credit. Cancer is so damn complex we may never know what's at play. It's a war we're losing (if you look at the raw data  ... that is) so YES it would be great to see some fresh angles explored (and that's started to happen), but it would also be misguided to jump the gun.   Keto won't cure cancer but it may well be a tool to put in the treatment box. Time will tell.....we hope.   # dontfearfat   # cerealkillersmovie   See More",

Nibali managed to finally make his goal Tour weight (64 kilos) during the team's final training camp in San Pellegrino, Italy, where he combined intense motorpace workouts with a strict diet.\"   The margins these guys function at are where victory - or defeat - gets decided. Balancing minimal body fat with maximal power and endurance output is the secret sauce for cyclists ... , yet sports science continues to \"study\" carbs pretty much exclusively as a source for fuel in acute performance metrics. The full picture for any athlete includes recovery, consistency, power, speed and longevity (seasonal up to and including career) before we can think constructively and strategically about winning.  Of course the best athletes - and their coaches - already know this. Sports doc Dr Peter Bruker called it in Run on Fat Movie when he told us \"This is a one per cent-er\".   Today in Dublin, the gaelic footballer Andy Moran (also featured in Run on Fat) goes for gold in the national final in front of 83000 spectators. At 33 y/o, he is one of the favorites for player of the year. The commentators are bemused at how he keeps his level of performance against much younger men.    In the world of elite sport, that Brukner one per cent is where the magic can happen. Ask Andy  ;)     # runonfatmovie   See More",

They have been there !!! Done that !!  Friends your own age go through life right by your side and younger friends keep you aiming  high as they seek for your guidance  and well they keep You young with their perspectives,  energy  and thirst for life ! In the end though , friendship matters no matter how old Or young you are . The end   😘",

When we try and force children to keep eating after they say they are full, or convince them they aren’t hurt when they are, or tell them that what they are crying about isn’t worth crying about, we are telling them that their experiences aren’t reality. When we gaslight our children, they begin to question their own judgment. They stop listening to their intuition.

        "description": "Knight Air Conditioning Inc. We recently sent out our reminder postcards for seasonal tune ups and today something really wonderful happened.  I answered the phone to one of our friends who is also a client. I've known her since I was about 4 years old, so that's 30+ years without admitting my actual age  ;)   She'd received the postcard and wanted to call us because she had recently sold her home and moved to an assisted living facility. We spoke for awhile, and the predominate feeling during the whole call was one of  long standing friendship. She thanked us for all the valuable service over the years. I thanked her for the call and made sure she knew that we're here for her whether related to air conditioning or not.  These are the kind of relationships that we value and it means a lot to us that so many of our friend clients feel the same.",

Project Regeneration variety spotlight: The Boitano Sweet Red onion has been passed down through the Italian family of David Cavagnaro’s grandmother, Mary (Boitano) Cavagnaro. Her family has grown it since at least the 1920s. David, a Seed Savers Exchange adviser and former farm manager, shared the seed with us in 1988. The onion's exact origin is unclear, but David suspects that Mary's parents, John and Rosa Boitano, brought it with them when they emigrated from Genoa, Italy in the 1870s and settled in California. Seeds like this variety are heirlooms - worthy of being preserved and shared, which is what we are working to do. You can help by supporting Project Regeneration. Your donation ensures varieties like the Boitano Sweet Red onion will be grown by future generations. Donate:  seedsavers.org/regenerate",

Please, if considering getting a bunny for Easter, think it through, this is a 9-12 year commitment! Research all that you will need so your bunny can live a long healthy life! I can not begin to tell you how many bunny rescues are full, especially a few to several months after Easter when the novelty of a bunny wears off, and the families did not research what bunny care consists of. They are not novelty gifts, they are living creatures that deserve to be loved for all their bunny years. If after you research all there is to know on bunny care and want to make that commitment, check rescues! There are bunnies of all sizes and ages just waiting to be loved by you! Or...Donate to a bunny rescue this Easter rather than purchase one. That is all  <3",

Max is the first fur baby my husband and I adopted as our first son.  He is not feeling well, and I need to spend every minute I can with him. If I am not posting much over the next few days, this is why. I ask that no visitors come over the next few days for tours as I will be too distracted. It is so hard to see a family member get old.

I think he will be very happy here. We have about 5 other Silkie breeds here as well as other small breeds he will love to hang out and search for bugs in the garden with. He will also attend therapy visits to the care homes when we take our other hens and roosters for lap snuggles with the elderly.",

        "description": "Tim Ferriss \"I Am Not A Self-Made Man\", a short essay by  Arnold Schwarzenegger .  Speaking as a Long Island kid raised on Commando and Predator, this is a dream come true.  Arnold Schwarzenegger – the freaking Terminator – was kind enough to write the Foreword for Tools of Titans. Whaaat?! Seriously, I have to pinch myself. ...  The more time I spend with Arnold and his team, the more impressed I am. The more I study his life, the more I want to think bigger, stretch my limits, and smile at the naysayers of life. His habits, decisions, philosophies, and routines are endlessly fascinating, which I explore in ToT.  Arnold, thank you. Danke sehr!  Now, without further ado, click here to read the Foreword for Tools of Titans by Arnold, which could also be titled “I Am Not A Self-Made Man.” ➜  https://toolsoftitans.com/foreword/   See More Tim",

There were only 3 sweet ladies at this facility today, a good place to start to see how Flo would react, and how people with Alzheimer's and Dementia would react to having a duck come for a visit. It went wonderfully! Flo snuggled into their laps, One lady was reluctant to let go of Flo towards the end. Her smiles lit the room up! Flo enjoyed some snuggles, some food and water the ladies fed to her. The ladies all were talking about Flo, asking questions and whatnot. One of the women had bad memory and had asked me about 20 times what Flo's name was. It is sad to see people with memory loss, but brightened my day to bring smiles with this special little duck  <3",

Arnold Schwarzenegger – the freaking Terminator – was kind enough to write the Foreword for Tools of Titans. Whaaat?! Seriously, I have to pinch myself. ...  The more time I spend with Arnold and his team, the more impressed I am. The more I study his life, the more I want to think bigger, stretch my limits, and smile at the naysayers of life. His habits, decisions, philosophies, and routines are endlessly fascinating, which I explore in ToT.  Arnold, thank you. Danke sehr!  Now, without further ado, click here to read the Foreword for Tools of Titans by Arnold, which could also be titled “I Am Not A Self-Made Man.” ➜  https://toolsoftitans.com/foreword/   See More Tim",

I was just notified of some really basic needs for families in our shelter here at  UMOM New Day Centers  which we are struggling to meet based on low levels of donations of these items. If you are able to provide any of these items, I would be ever so grateful (as would the families!):  - new/gently used twin and full sheet sets and blankets  - new/gently used towels (bath, face, hand, bath mats)  - new packages of underwear for men/women/children   - specific school supplies: colored pencils, markers, pocket folders, pencil sharpeners  Furniture needs - Please contact Arthur Perez, our Resource Logistics Coordinator, to discuss your furniture donation and possibly arrange a pick-up (602-899-7061):  -  twin, full, and queen mattresses and box springs (no rips/stains/excessive wear), kitchen tables/chairs, dressers, night stands, lamps, flat screen led/lcd tvs  Any assistance you are able to provide is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your consideration.  :) Vynnie McDaniels",

Tips to protect yourself against heat stress:  ​ Drink cool water periodically. Avoid liquids that contain alcohol or large amounts of sugar. Also avoid ice-cold drinks, which can cause stomach cramps.  ·         Pace yourself; take breaks, preferably in the shade.  ·         If you work outside, do the heaviest work during the cooler hours.  ·         Avoid large meals before work activities.  ·         Wear sunscreen; apply it on your face, ears, hands and arms.  ·         Wear light-colored clothing; cotton is the most breathable.  ·         Wear a wide-brim hat to protect your neck, ears, eyes, forehead, nose and scalp.  ·         Read medication labels for information about possible drug interactions with the heat and sun. Certain medicines can increase the risk of sunburn and heat stress.  Signs and symptoms of heat-related disorders include dry, pale skin with no sweating; hot, reddened skin that looks sunburned; and mood changes such as irritability and confusion. If somebody exhibits signs of heat stress, get the person under shade and call 911.",

        "description": "Knight Air Conditioning Inc. Hi Friends and Family! Here it comes, the day we've all been waiting for/dreading. Hunker down because the forecast temperature for next Wednesday is 120°!!     You had your ac tuned up in anticipation of this day. Here are a few more things to be aware of with heat like this:   *Do you have outdoor pets?  Consider bringing them inside or providing access to a cooled/shaded area with access to plenty of cool, fresh water. Direct sunlight heats up a dish of water quickly. These are literally \"killer temperatures\".    *Keep doors closed and window shades drawn. Consider shading windows from the outside that typically get a lot of direct sunlight.  *Change your ac filter if you haven't already done so within the last few weeks-adequate air flow to the unit is key.   Do you have any questions or tips for surviving the desert heat? Chat with us here...",

        "description": "Baylee's Wish To everyone who has participated in Baylee's Wish, you made SO many kids happy today!!! The smiles on those kids faces were priceless! We literally watched kids laying there, feeling crummy while getting infusions, light up with the chance to get a new toy! Kids that were in chairs next to each other started playing together and bonding over their new toys. And on a side note, we got to see the doctor who diagnosed Baylee, whom we haven't seen since that day because he left PCH and recently came back. Baylee blew his mind! He couldn't believe how healthy she is! It is a true blessing to get to do this every year and to get to celebrate life with these two amazing kids.  # survivor   # hero   # miracles   # dontstopbelieving",

Over the last 4 weeks, they have made it a company-wide effort to gather toys to bring smiles to the little warriors at Phoenix Children's Hospital. They talked about it daily in their morning meetings, and they had a \"goal thermometer\" on the wall to track their progress and keep everyone excited. They truly care about making a difference and helping their community. Their team collecte ... d 326 toys and raised $700!!!!!! I can't even describe the emotions that I felt when I saw all of those toys. There was so much love on that factory floor, it was just incredible. Thank you, thank you, thank you, to Chromalloy's entire team for your generosity, selflessness, support and love. We are so blessed to have you be part of this!!  # survivor   # hero   # miracles   # NEGU   # strongerthancancer   # faith   See More",

I saw this little girl crying out on the sidewalk in front of the Hyatt hotel.   I'm assuming she was with these people and heading somewhere. Being this is not a place for kids really. but its real life unfortunately. As I walk by I hear the lady ask why she is crying. And the little girl says...\"Because people were yelling mean things to each other\". I wish everyone could just see through the eyes of a child. this makes me wanna tear every time I look at it.  #trumprally",

        "description": "Our beloved friend and founder Louise Hay transitioned this morning, August 30, 2017, of natural causes at age 90. She passed peacefully surrounded by loved ones.    Louise was an incredible visionary and advocate. Everyone who had the privilege to meet her, either in person, or through her words, felt her passion for serving others.    “Meeting Louise changed the direction of my life,” said Reid Trac ... y, President and CEO of Hay House, Inc. “Her passion for serving others translated into everything she did. Simply by working alongside her, an analytical accountant like me transformed into someone who became aware of the power of affirmations and self-love. Being able to learn from her has been one of my life’s greatest blessings. The beauty of Louise was that you didn’t have to work alongside her to learn from her, you felt like you were there with her, with every word you read or heard.”    Hay House will carry on Louise’s legacy and continue to publish products and online learning courses that align with her message of self-improvement and self-love.
