I'm all for training yourself AND your family (including your kids) on how to properly defend themselves. But that's all guns are for - self defense.   Self defense does not include parading your guns around. It does not include using your guns as a form of intimidation.   And if you truly want to legitimize your right to own guns, you need to leave these things behind. Because... You're kind of shooting your self in the foot. Roxy Lee Mike Nuetzman",

        "description": "Roxy Lee  is with  Caleb Frieze  and  4 others . .Net is a programming infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying and running applications like desktop and Web services. If you're new to coding, this is a very valuable framework to have under your belt!   A lot of you were asking about Developer events. Well, this one is in Chandler tomorrow night.   I'll be heading over to join .Net Newbies. If you guys would like to join, please do!   BRING YOUR LAPTOPS TO THIS SESSION - WE WILL BE CODING  THIS TIME!  For developers, you have to start somewhere and since this is a newbie group, we are going to start at the very beginning and that beginning will start with basic data types, how they are used, how they are referenced, etc. I'll be using two sources of material:  1. This book, \"The C# Player's Guide\" by RB Whitaker, found at  https://smile.amazon.com/C-Players…/…/0985580127/ref=sr_1_1…  2. This video course as suggested by one of the January attendees:  https://mva.microsoft.com/…/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beg…  Also, look up the acronym \"SOLID\" on Wikipedia and reading the definition enough times that you can rattle off each principal without thinking about it. This will be the topic of discussion.   http://meetu.ps/c/2yL6R/yYWgS/f",
