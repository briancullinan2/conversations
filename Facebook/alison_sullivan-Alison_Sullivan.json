Next weekend I will be in Sedona but I just realized Coachelle is that weekend.  The weekend after that, Friday the 20th, is the Florence and the Machine concert, here is the ticket info:\nhttp://www.ticketliquidator.com/tix/florence-and-the-machine--in--phoenix-az-tickets.aspx\nI think he got tickets in section 2 or 6 so the seats should be pretty excellent.\nMy number is 480-466-0856 if you are interested. \nFlorence and the Machine Phoenix Tickets - Florence and the Machine Tickets Phoenix AZ Schedule\nticketliquidator.com\n"
