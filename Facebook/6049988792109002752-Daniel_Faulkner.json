Later I honed my skills on the web with PHP and JavaScript. I enjoy all forms of software development and computer administration. In previous positions a 6 month salary review has worked well, as it gives us both a chance to show what we are made of, without breaking the bank. I have a lot of experience with start-ups, so I am no stranger to bringing new products and technologies to market in a controlled environment. I would enjoy a change to meet more of the team. For reference, I would be looking in the ballpark of $180k. Thank you.   -Brian",
