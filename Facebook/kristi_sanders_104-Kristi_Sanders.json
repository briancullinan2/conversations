But I wanted to reach out and say, by association with your sister, I think you deserve better than the conditions we met under.  I know people who have taken similar wrong turns in their lives; in fact some of the most brilliant people I know have been victims of substances.  If you ever need to talk to an unbiased party, I am a positive and logical influence. \n"
