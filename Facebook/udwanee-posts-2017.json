        "description": "Ahmed Wallan Muslim prayer ---------------  Muslim prayer is distinguished from other prayers for the owners of other faiths. It is obligatory and imposed.  Without it you will have destroyed religion, and if you have established it, you will have established the religion.  It is imposed and must be done by coercion  Prayer in all religions and other faiths  It is a free relationship in which there is no specific word that must be repeated and repeated  The Muslim prayer must be in the classical Arabic language and it is the language of Quran  While the people and owners of other religions pray in their local dialects and whatever their language  It is not a requirement that you keep certain verses and say them in a certain language  Malaysian or Chinese who does not know Arabic  It is obligatory to read the prayer in Arabic until it is valid.  Without even understanding what he says so he or she chants like a parrot  As if God would not understand the remaining languages.  It is all like a robot, you do things that are repeated and repeated like the machine exactly.  Prayer in other religions can be said in any language  Or even to say it in a group of languages ​​in one prayer.  The prayer of this spiritual relationship must be free and not by coercion or compulsion.  It is a relationship of ponder and thinking.  And not words repeated throughout the day as Al-Fatiha repeated by the Muslim at least 17 times a day  In the number of rak'ahs of the five prayers combined.  It is a relationship that must be a result of true love and desire, not coercion.  Either you are forced to pray  In a certain way  And at a certain time  And in a certain direction  In a certain way  And certain words  And in a certain language  And a certain number  And certain movements  This is the biggest dictatorship in worship  The simple delay of the Muslim about the prayer (Voyl him) so says by(Muhammad)in Quran chapter 107 verse 4and5:  4.So woe to the praying ones,  5 .Who are unmindful of their prayer!  If this threat is just a threat  For worshipers who may be slightly behind the prayer time imposed on them.  \"So what will happen to non-worshipers\"  And do not forget that it is not permissible to pray before the time of prayer even if five minutes  As if you are taking a appointment with the dentist, for example.",

        "description": "Ahmed Wallan Ten ways to make sure that God is a myth made by man  1- Political God  The human political system is based on a hierarchical order in which the authorities increase as we move up, beginning with the authority of the father at home until we reach the authority of the parliament, the government, the president or the king, and we find that each official depends on his control of the people on orders of higher rank. Humans invented something that has a higher authority than the king, so God called it to make it easier for the king to control the people in the name of higher authority, so we found Muhammad saying, \"Obey Allah and the Apostle and the Rulers of You.\" It is clear that Muhammad uses God as an element in a hierarchical political system.  2 - God curiosity  We always find in religions the God who follows and intervenes in every small and large in the lives of people. For example, Muhammad says about God, \"He is with you wherever you are.\" He also says about him: \"Do not leave small or large except counted.\" This curious nature is a human nature, I really care about assessing people based on the outcome of their lives.  3 - God is trivial  Trivialities does not end in the religions and the biggest vanity is what is the religion and what makes him a target for life, I mean worship and sanctification and veneration and praise to God and rituals that are meaningless and useless, was it not the first god that was present to ask the people to use their minds and their time in the benefit of humanity instead From wasting time in silly worship, God who cares to evaluate people based on the movements of their prayers and follow their words no doubt that he is a God of the manufacture of human minds.  4- The emotional God  God gets angry and is pleased and loves and hates and is hostile and rejoice and flaunts revenge and plotted and cheat and be patient and ruthless and gets paranoid and see the words of Muhammad \"when Asfona Antqmna them Vogrguenahm companions,\" This is a god with emotional decisions but it is a human invention and expresses the man who invented psychological.  5. The Human God  God is always in the religions paints in human beings, even in Islam, which is not allowed to draw God's Word in the modern recipe (I saw my Lord in the form of a young man glabrous frizzy him a green suit) and attributes of God in the Quran and Hadith of the hearing, sight, eye, hand and right fist paint him in the end image Closer to humanity, and this can not be explained, but God made the minds of humans so it was in their image, and if cats believe in God was never in the image.  6 - God the criminal  If any people God sent them collective punishment has not been subjected and exterminated with weapons of mass destruction, old and young, men and women, in the Koran, \"and if we want to drown the village ordered Mtrfaita Vvsagoa the right of them to say Vadmournaha destructive\" and where \"what I believed before them from the village Ohlknaha,\" This destruction Mass and collective punishments are human acts par excellence, for humans invented the idea of ​​God attributed to them the same means.  7-God is male  Always talk about God in the conscience of the masculine, the idea of ​​God mentioned, imagine the male, the male societies in which religions originated produced a male god, and produced religions biased against women, in the Koran \"and for men to degree.\"  8-God is the speaker  Speak of the qualities of human beings, God can communicate with humans without this human trait, but we noticed that all gods are dealing with human beings human words and languages ​​of human, causing a problem in communication and learning religions to those who are different language, but because God is a human industry, the one who made only find Speech to deliver his message.  9 - God racial  Every religion depicts God in the form of the race in which this religion originated. In Indian religions, we see the drawings of the gods in the image of an Indian. In Christianity he paints God as a white man. In Islam he did not paint but gave privileges to the Arabs as stated in the hadeeth: Chose the Arabs, then chose Arabs Quresha, then chose Quraish Bani Hashim, then chose me from Bani Hashem, I am the finest of the finest \"and saying:\" Caliphate in Quraysh. \"  10 - God the poor  God always needs money \"Who will lend God a good loan?\" In which mosque will you find a donation box? Why does God need money? Can not he save the money for his religion ?! This can only be explained by the fact that God is a human idea invented by some to collect people's money in their name.",

Why do not we see this on the ground? Why do millions of creatures die every day because of hunger and thirst? Why does this merciful God create a savage, merciless environment based on prey on one another? Why have 90% of the planet's organisms been extinct? What is the wisdom of creating non-rational beings so that they may suffer and die and become extinct? Or is your Lord plaguing unconscionable creatures to test them as you justify your suffering and consider it an abomination? That the wise person will know answered to the questions posed and will know that your father does not protect and does not live and has no impact on something your God does not bear responsibility to his creatures and leave them to die starvation and thirst and disease even monsters in the wild in the wild if it was in place would have mercy on him And therefore do not talk about a merciful and loving and just and you live in a deadly environment, merciless and destructive, this is illogical and incorrect and that God does not exist only in the imagination of the primitive man who invented it in a moment of despair and weakness because of the cruelty of nature And she killed her  An impressive image of an animal in the height of satisfaction and happiness thanks to the blessing of blessing  Life and divine care for his only son and for his living",

        "description": "‎ Ben Andrews ‎   to   Ahmed Wallan Thank you for your request to become a friend on facebook and I approved it gladly. PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE TO THE END. I hope you have sent your request because you are interested in my posts and my writing. I am 80 years old and happily married. I have researched world religion, archaeology and neuro-science for many years and created my website  www.origin-of-religion.com  to help people find the arguments to use when defending a secular worldview and to overcome the fear of Hell. There is much free material to find there. If you agree with a post of mine, ‘Like’ and ‘Share’ this information with all your friends. TO RECEIVE MY POSTS YOU MUST “FOLLOW” ME AS WELL.   Go to  http://www.facebook.com/Benjowou/   and click on “follow” . If you do not want to see or debate my posts or blogs, please “unfriend” me, since Facebook has a limit to the number of friends one can have, thus making room for someone who is interested. I have also written a book that you can recommend to your friends. It is a great present to give to people who struggle with doubts about their religion or sit on the fence and don’t know which way to jump, also for older teenagers to show the other side of the story. I feel it is not enough just to become an unbeliever but that it is important to spread factual knowledge so we can finally live in a world free from superstitions and religions trying to coerce their worldview on others. I hope you find that important as well and help me to do just that.",

Everyone feels less vulnerable to a traffic accident than others. We all have that belief that our chances of danger are small compared to others. \"For others, this dangerous cognitive bias is called\" optimism. \"It is the most common illogical behavior. Pessimism is more rational than optimism because it drives us to act cautiously. However, pessimism and optimism are arbitrary ways of dealing with the unknown and the future. The best alternative is probability thinking, which only recognizes numbers.  ‏The probability of your death in a traffic accident is no different than the probability of those who died!",

Muslims scholars said most of the Quran keepers died in wars against the apostates especially in the war of Yamama 632 AD before the gathering of the Quran by 21 years.  2-The Hadith:  Al-Bukhari born in Bukhara(Uzbekistan) in 810 AD and died in 870 AD.  The first book of the Hadith was written in 842 AD,(210 years after the death of Muhammad)!!!!.  the Bukhari collected 600000 hadith and accepted only 7000.!!!.so how much the lies was profused,[  Abu Huraira (narrator of most of the hadith he was Ruler at the time of the Umayya era)(Follow the Umayya authority]  3-The biography of Muhammad:  The first biography of Muhammad appeared in 754 AD and was written by Ibn Ishak(122 years after the death of Muhammad)!!!  Ibn Ishak born in704 AD and died in 761 AD  but his book is (missed)!!! so the biography which is available now is the second copy (appeared 200 years after the death of Muhammad !!)  Ibn Hisham rewrites the book of Ibn Ishak and admitted that he delete a lot of it.  Ibn Hisham died in 828 AD.  In Summary [, Islam was made after the death of Muhammad including all Quran, Hadith and the biography]",

        "description": "Ahmed Wallan Shared from  Ben Andrews  :  Is Religion a Delusion?  Read the symptoms outlined by the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mentally Disorders) published by the APA (American Psychiatric Association) of Delusion Disorder.  -The patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force.  -That idea appears to have an undue influence on the patient's life, and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent.  -Despite his/her profound conviction, there is often a quality of secretiveness or suspicion when the patient is questioned about it.  -The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive, especially about the belief.  -There is a quality of centrality: no matter how unlikely it is that these strange things are happening to him/her, the patient accepts them relatively unquestioningly.  -An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, often with irritability and hostility.  -The belief is, at the least, unlikely, and out of keeping with the patient's social, cultural, and religious background.  -The patient is emotionally over-invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of their psyche.  -The delusion, if acted out, often leads to behaviors which are abnormal and/or out of character, although perhaps understandable in the light of the delusional beliefs.  -Individuals who know the patient observe that the belief and behavior are uncharacteristic and alien.  -It is a primary disorder.  -It is a stable disorder characterized by the presence of delusions to which the patient clings with extraordinary tenacity.  -The illness is chronic and frequently lifelong.  -The delusions are logically constructed and internally consistent.  -The delusions do not interfere with general logical reasoning (although within the delusional system the logic is perverted) and there is usually no general disturbance of behavior. If disturbed behavior does occur, it is directly related to the delusional beliefs.  -The individual experiences a heightened sense of self-reference. Events which, to others, are nonsignificant are of enormous significance to him or her, and the atmosphere surrounding the delusions is highly charged. (Wikipedia)  Furthermore: \"Another difficulty with the diagnosis of delusions is that almost all of these features can be found in \"normal\" beliefs. Many religious beliefs hold exactly the same features\". (Wikipedia)  For more particulars go to “Delusion” in Wikipedia and to the References near the end of the article. Lots of information to be found there.",
