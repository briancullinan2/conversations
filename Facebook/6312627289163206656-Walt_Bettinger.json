You give them a clearly defined set of goals and objectives with a mutually agreed upon timeline. If you haven't already done so, I suggest you create a 30-60-90 day plan, or a 30d-6mo-1yr timeline with each direct report in a creative role. If their role is a service job, then tell them you expect at least 2 unsolicited positive comments from the people they provide service over the next 2 months. If they ask - how am I supposed to do that -your response is - thats for you to figure out. If they don't, replace them. I assume you have hire and fire responsibility. If not, then you can't hold anyone accountable.",
