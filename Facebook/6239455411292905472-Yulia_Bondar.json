Booking.com is now the 3rd largest e-commerce site in the world behind only Amazon and Alibaba. The biggest our challenge is handling with Big Data and Scalability.\n\nI specifically wanted to reach out to you as it seems you have quite broad experience with various programming languages. Here at booking our hackers use Perl in 80% of our code, however having experience with Perl isn't a necessity. We tend to look for developers who are technically agnostic with a polyglot mindset and your experience seems to be exactly what we would look for. \nWe are a great place to work in terms of technical challenges and we offer full relocation support to make you comfortable.\n\nWould you be interested to hear more?\nRegards,\nYulia\n\nYulia Bondar\n+380980209821 | juliyabondar@gmail.com\n"
