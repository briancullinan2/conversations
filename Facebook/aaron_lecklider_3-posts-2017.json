The rules are simple:  * Once you are nominated your 22 days starts the following day  * Every day record yourself doing 22 push-ups and post it, copy this text and the hashtag to each post.   * Every day nominate a different person, try to choose people you think will want to do this and/or have the ability to do it.  * And finally, this is a simple and fun way to get the word out about a serious matter that more people need to be aware about. Our veterans are brave men and women who put their lives on the line for us. It's sad that so many good veterans feel that suicide is the only way out. We encourage you to reach out to the Veterans in your life and remind them that they have your love and support or they may lose their battle. Please spread the word that Veteran suicide is not the answer.",

        "description": "Aaron Lecklider Don't pay attention to the title of the video so much as the content.  A young man makes a claim that there are \"skinheads\" at an event, ends up talking to him, finds out the reason and apologizes. Then listens to his point of view and they discuss calmly.  This is the way I (and most people I believe) want to see debate on a personal level.",
