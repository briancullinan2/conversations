It is so nice to finally have a tracker that gives me a semblance of accuracy for my activity. Thanks for that Apple. Now this year they are taking care of me in the classroom with iOS 11 and the iPad Pro! I'm so excited to make that a part of my class this year! Bryant Diaz  ¬∑  June 13, 2016  ¬∑  Thank you Apple for taking people like me into account. I could not more more thrilled that you are optimizing Apple Watch for wheelchair users.

You all weren't concerned that he never brought that up. Also don't act like these Anti-Fa people are not ever violent. They purposely make situations violent in order to stifle the abilities of those they disagree with from pushing their dialogue. Had there not been a counter protest (which they have every right to do) this would have been a total non story. Then the culprit of the killing would have probably only killed some of his fellow minded friends. Try doing what you told republicans to do for the last 8 years and try to stand by the President. He's far from perfect but he's what we got. Oh wait... he's gonna get impeached though right? /rant Timmy Turner Joy Musillo Bryant Diaz Joe Louis Manning III",
