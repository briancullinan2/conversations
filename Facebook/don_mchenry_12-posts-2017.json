If you believe that there is some kind of equivalency between a semi-automatic assault rifle, equipped with a bump stock, [which effectively turns it into a fully automatic weapon] and a car, or a knife, or a hammer, or a torque wrench, or a TOASTER [yes, some fuckwit said he could kill me with a fucking 'toaster',... ya know, I could kill you with a fucking toilet seat, but, I guarantee..., we ain't banning toilet seats any time soon.].............. then you simply belong in a goddamn mental institution, period.",
