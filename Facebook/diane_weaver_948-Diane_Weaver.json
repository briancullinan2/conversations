I love being with senior adults because they are wise and kind.  I learn so much from them.  And it is so much fun to work with young couples as they are beginning their lives together and the joy they exude.  It took me a long time to get here and I had many jobs I didn't like, stressed about.  My prayer for you is you find your joy and that you gave patience to live into it.  Love you!\n"
