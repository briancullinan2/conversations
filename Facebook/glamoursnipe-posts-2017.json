        "description": "Mariposa P. Schmetterling (Wedge, Simone, and Hobbie read their hate comments - some of these are shamelessly based on the Mean Tweets segments you see all over YouTube.  Rough language ahead; suck it up.)  Simone’s disclaimer: “Before we get started, these pertain only to us three - we deliberately left out anyone who can’t be here to defend themselves, but if you’d like to see Reese, Wes, et cetera read their own hate messages, comment to the side and let us know.  Right.  Let’s get roasted.”  “Is it just me, or does Hobbie have the most punchable face in the galaxy?  I’d like nothing more than to sock him right in his mopey, slack, girly-lipped face.”  Aww, you like my lips.  “I bet Simone gives really halfhearted tit-fucks.”  Wes, is that you?  “I hope Wedge’s dick falls off.  In public.”  How much did Jonek Vlarr pay you to say that?  “Hobbie is delightfully paradoxical in that he he’s a huge dick with a small cock.” Compared to Wedge, everybody has a small cock.  “Someone just told me I could be a clone of Wedge Antilles and I don’t know whether to take a thousand selfies or put a blaster to my head.”  Put it in your mouth if you want to make sure.  “Simone always looks like she needs something very basic explained to her.  Seriously, is that bitch just high on drugs all the time?”  Well, that’s not the mark of an amateur - you can’t even specify which drugs you think I’m on.  [whispers] It’s Pleezer. [wink]  “Hobbie is so annoying when he eats...or laughs...or speaks...or exists.” Couldn’t agree more.  “Wedge’s snaggleteeth bother the fek out of me.  They look like a mouthful of Tik Taks throwing gang signs.” And here’s a smile just for you. That’s actually hilarious.  “How does Simone look anorexic and fat at the same time? Weird.” I think that's called being a healthy weight. I could be wrong.  “Klivian is a sewer rat who got turned into a human being and became a sex offender.” These unauthorised biographies are getting out of hand.  “I imagine Wedge smells like a Wookiee’s toilet brush.”  You’ve smelled a Wookiee’s toilet brush?  Damn, son.  “Simone’s forehead the size of my ass cheek.  And you should know that I weigh over 110 kilos.”  You should know that it’s called a fivehead.  Feigning ignorance is no way to land a burn.  “Just gonna throw this out there.  I hate Hobbie.  I hate his mouth-breathing face.  I hate his dumb fake name.  I hate how he’s better known for wrecking ships than doing anything productive in them.  I hate how he always looks like he’s about to start ugly-crying because the waitress fekked up his order.  I hate the smug way way he stares at Simone now like, ‘Yeah, I’m sticking my knob in that.’  I hate you, you potato-headed bastard.”  Oh, you just had to bring potatoes into this, didn’t you?  “It’s like Simone’s titties are a mid-school dance where the boys stand on one side of the room and the girls stand on the other.”  And you’d know all about mid-school, using the word ‘titties’.    “Every short, smug, mediocre-looking human male is Wedge to me.” I thought these were supposed to be hate comments.  “Hobbie looks like his voice is putting his face to sleep.” And my middle finger is putting you in your place.  “Simone is a crazy-eyed Worlport ghetto trash bag and someday I’m going to knock her bitch ass out.”  Hobbie, tell your mother she wishes.  “I think Klivian will fit right in on Corellia.  We have a lot of sarcastic, unlikeable, egotistical assholes here.” Yes, it seems you do.  “Hey, Antilles!  Eat a sack of dicks, you half-melted-candle-looking wanker!” Nah, I just had lunch; I’m good.  You dig right in, though.  “You know Simone has got the most stretched-out busted-up pussy of all time.  You could probably fit the Rogues’ entire fleet of X-Wings up there.  With the foils open.”  Never could take rejection, could you, Reignbos?  “Wedge is kind of a phenomenon, when you think about the struggle of balancing that giant head and that massive ego on that wormy little body.” I’m just overrun with talent.      “Wedge and Hobbie look like those misshapen fruits the supermarkets try to push on you because they still taste just as good as the stuff that looks right.”  [Wedge] We do taste good - not that you’ll ever find out.  “Oh, look.  Simone’s still a cunt.” Hmm.  Imagine if I put time and effort into it.  “I would rather break off my own arm and fuck myself in the ass with it than spend another nano listening to Hobbie and Simone giggle hysterically at nothing.” [Simone] Kinky.  [Hobbie] We'd pay to see that.",

So as a newly-minted political nihilist, I've chosen to embrace escapism and hedonism, and basically spend the rest of my life as the string quartet on the sinking Titanic.

Oversells the cranberry component a little bit, but another solid seven out of ten.  But I don't think anything in this joint is going to beat the chocolate truffle cake.  WEDGE: That cake not only receives a XXX taste bud rating, it's so dark it practically has an event horizon.  I wish Simone and Hobbie would eat stuff like that on The Ord Ralltiiri Experiment, instead of cabbage soda or five layers of hate sundae.  DANIELLE: You and Hobbie need take a load of our stuff home. Spend an entire episode breaking down what we sell and getting fat.  WEDGE: Might take you up on that. No fruit toast, though.  DANIELLE: No, Rogue Leader, no backing out of the fruit toast. Especially after this morning - I'm ready to properly drag the next motherfucker who orders it.  We need Simone and Hobbie on this case.  Only they can see through the hype.  WEDGE: Hobbie can already tell you it's overrated - and disgusting besides. Like something his mother would eat before she went on a permanent crash diet.  And Simone isn't going to look up from that truffle cake.  You won't find any straight answers there.",

Just remember, when that one you-are-all-so-far-beaneath-us acting family comes in, it's like Wes pointed out - a bad perm is still a bad perm, no matter how posh you think your ass is.  DANIELLE: At least we won't have to deal with those two knuckleheads rolling up like they just broke out of a Bruce Springsteen album fifteen minutes before we open.  I don't understand why 7:30 is such a difficult concept for them to grasp.  Also, them wanting us to bend the rules on THEIR behalf?  Shyeah.  The later I can postpone their fuckery, the better.  Indefinite would be literally perfect if you ask me.
