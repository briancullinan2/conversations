It's crazy how fast a year can go by and how much things can change in a year. People make it seem like such a big deal that I just upped and moved to the other side of the world. To me i think people are crazy for staying stuck somewhere they don't want to be. They have every excuse in the world of why they couldn't do it, but they wish they could. My question to you is what makes me any different than you? You can't complain about life and want different results but do the same stuff. I'm not saying you have to move across the world like I did. I'm just saying don't let life get in the way of your dreams.

So many people turn to violence as a solution. So many people use drugs and alcohol as a void. So many people really just don't believe they have a purpose on this earth. So many people people feel like they are alone. You're not alone. You have a purpose.  You can kill people with kindness. Drugs and alcohol just make things worse. Take a second and be thankful god woke you up today because so many people didn't get to. Whether or not you believe people don't love and need you. They do. When times get really hard don't be afraid to ask for help. God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. Just stay strong my friends. Keep fighting through the hard times. They will go away eventually.   C.y.p ---> change. Your. Perspective. Britney",

The family came to Arizona to visit. I am just so grateful to make it to another year. This birthday has been different. Not just cause I chilled at home in sweatpants practically all day or the fact it's 10 pm and I'm already getting ready to go to bed üòÇ üëµüèº  different as in my mindset. I'm not just getting older, I'm getting wiser. As I look back on the last 24 years all I can see is progress. Behind every strong person lies a broken childhood. I have been to hell and back. Twice! I've had to pick myself up on countless occasions. I stopped making excuses. I stopped blaming people. I learned how to forgive even when it hurts. I've learned that self development is the best gift you can give yourself. I learned to look for stars when it's dark. Most importantly I've learned how to change my perspective. #24  # positivevibes   # positivemind   # positivelife Britney Cline",
