Actually, regardless of what's going on with the bike lane, if there are two lanes and they're in the right, probably don't tail them and blare your horn.  Actually actually, you know what?

(I'm currently riding on the horrible, hard, weirdly shaped saddle my bike came with, made by people who think butts are concave steel blocks.) I called a local bike shop, and they tried to talk me into doing a $200 fitting.  This seems pretty unnecessary for someone who's just riding to and from work, not doing long rides, and who just wants \"reasonably comfortable,\" not \"absolutely perfect.\" I've tried out Gwen's saddle, and while it's not perfect, it's doable, unlike mine. Is there some arcane bicycle knowledge I'm missing that would make my decision to skip this fitting unreasonable?",

On the down side, the first half of our much-anticipated camping trip is canceled, and now I'm by myself for those three days. Anything going on tonight? Tomorrow?  😏",

Thanks to Kathy and  Sara  for collecting money and selling Jell-O Shots.   Thank you to  Crystal  and Greg; the Crystal Fussell Duo for playing mysic.  Thanks to Gwen and her wife  Eva Sclippa  for arranging the Jell-O Wrestling and setting up the pool.  Thanks to our referee for keeping it clean,  T Alesia Corley .  This year's Jell-O Wrestling Queen was Liz.  (Someone tag Liz) Thanks to all the girls and one drunk dude for wrestling.  We had great competitors and there would have been more if they had a change of clothing.  Thank you,  \"B\" aka  Bridge Palmer  for going out for more Beer!!!!  The ladies drank a whole Keg in 2 hours.  Lol.  The inspiration of the evening was Donna who was visiting Julia and Angie from Connecticut as well as the Wilmington Pride Youth Group.  Thank you to each and every person who came.....the grand total of donations was $550.00.  Every penny will be used to make the summer more enjoyable for LGBTQIA YOUTH.  I am sure just the thought that there is a group of wonderful women and a few guys who are already supporting them will be an amazing feeling.  The youth will decide as a group what they want to do for fun this summer.  It seems a bit self serving but I also wanted to pat myself on the back.  There was drama surrounding the event because of the Jell-O wrestling yet I continued to organize this event despite the backlash.  The wrestlers were not degraded or embarrassed.  It was good clean (sticky) fun and I even got in the ring and wrestled as well.  I would do ANYTHING for these kids and risked being beat by a woman which would have hurt my ego.  Thankful her knee started to hurt before she pinned me down and saved my ego.  She is training to be an MAA fighter so I was understandably nervous.  Also thanks to my pretend Wife for holding my goods while I wrestled.  She knows who she is! Lol.  Thank you to anyone and everyone who advertised the party.  Great fun!!! Bridge Palmer",

I don't necessarily think removing these statues is the MOST important issue we face right now, but it's where battle lines are being drawn, and at this point what should have been an obvious choice all along has finally become an urgent one, too. So heck yes. Put them in museums. Put them in parks and contextualize the heck out of them. Replace them with statues of people who didn't fight--whether personally or as a nation--for the right to enslave, torture, and kill other humans.
