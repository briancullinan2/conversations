Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.

If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

If you thought any woman could blame any man at any time before now, consider how easy it is for any woman to ride the coattails of any other accuser, which in turn makes any accusation look stronger.  No proof.  No investigation. No evidence. No witness. No due process.  N ... o official legal case.  Just say it and its true.  Accusation = proof.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate.

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",

Hillary. We're talking Hillary here. Your reason for pledging such undying support? Certainly not her platform or experience. Most definitely not her charisma. No, no, you bow down and kiss the pant leg because Hillary's a woman. You excuse any and all criticisms ofHillary Clintonas blanket \"sexism.\" You  ... cry, sometimes actual real tears, when anyone rebukes your pantsuited queen.   Your abject weakness proves what I've always believed: modern SJW feminists do not care about \"equality.\" Nor are you \"strong\" women. So stop it with the hashtags and vanity mugs. You're nothing more than whining brats who throw tantrums when things just aren't going your way. I suggest you bulk purchase boxes of Depends. And no, the government shan't provide them for you.   If you actually cared about \"equality,\" as your oft cited mission statement of \"Feminism simply means gender equality\" states (which you bludgeon your critics with at every opportunity), you wouldn't put such blind support in a candidate who has flagrantly broken the law. Or who has covered up for her husband's many, many rapescapades. Allegedly.   Your blind support for a female candidate, for no other reason than she's a female, paints feminists as the very sexists you claim to hate. If it's wrong to vote for a man simply because he's a man, how is it not sexist to...\"   [Read more below]   See More",
