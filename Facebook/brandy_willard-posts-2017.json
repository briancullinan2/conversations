The Roswell Homeless Coalition will be at Jesse McDaniel's Christmas display located at 2509 Cambridge on Friday, December 15th from 5pm to 10pm collecting donations.  As of right now, there is not an operating homeless shelter in Roswell. The Roswell Homeless Coalition entered into a lease agreement with the Rivers of Life and we are making the appropriate renovations to bring the shelter up to code so the doors may open.   We will have hot cocoa and featured Gold Bars from Chef Toddzilla for $1.00 each donations.  Jesse McDaniel has not only allowed us to collect donations during his light display but will match up to $1,000 of donations raised. We are hoping that 10  local businesses will follow suit and pledge to match the donations raised through the night.    1.

First it was \"politically correct\" to say that people shouldn't use racial slurs.  Then it was \"politically correct\" to say that men should stop sexually harassing women.  Now, apparently, it's \"politically correct\" to have a problem with pedophilia.  As far as I can tell, southern Republicans think it's \"politically correct\" to be a decent human being.",

She is also a Dreamer, arriving to the United States when she was 7 months old from Alamos, Sonora, Mexico. A month before DACA was announced by President Barack Obama, Blanca found herself graduating college with no clear idea on what the future entailed for her and pushed aside her future aspirations.   DACA completely changed her life by granting her the opportunity to pursue the goals she once had to put on hold. However, Blanca‚Äôs work permit expires in 358 days and like her fellow Dreamers she now awaits for what the future holds for her.   Join Blanca in telling your members of Congress we need a Dream Act NOW.",
