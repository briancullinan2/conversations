Festivities will begin at Horizon Park at 5. We've reserved the Gila Monster softball field (the one closest to the building).\n2. Because we rented the field and lights, it would be much appreciated if everyone could chip in a couple bucks to help cover that cost.\n3. Bring waterguns...please.\n4. There is always the option of grabbing some grub after, so if you're interested be sure to bring some money. \n\nAgain, anyone and everyone is welcome so so bring all your friends (if you have any).\n"

Also, thank you for pitching in a few bucks to cover the fees and for helping to clean up.\nLast night I acquired quite the selection of water weaponry, so if you would like to claim any of that just let me know.\n\nThanks again for everything. Sorry for those of you who couldn't make it.  We'll probably plan another in the winter so be ready!\n\n"
