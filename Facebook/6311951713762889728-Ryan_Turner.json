Right now I have 2 different permanent Software Engineer roles and both companies have EXTREMELY different culture. Generally the name of the company comes up about 5 minutes into the conversation.  Also, I am a Systems & Network Engineer, you don't get the full story of anyone in technologies backgrounds until you talk to them. Either way, it is a great opportunity. If you are interested, I would like to talk more.",
