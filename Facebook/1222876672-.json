There are 4 sites now and I have made the account login the same for most of them.\nThe username for the following 2 sites is bjcullinan\nThe password is daddy123\nhttp://newzbin.com is back up and running, their site got hacked and people are illegally updating it, so I might not renew after my credits expire.\nhttp://nzbmatrix is similar to newzbin\nThe files from those sites can be uploaded, or in the case of newzbin a link can be provided on this page:\nhttp://sabnzbd.bjcullinan.com\n\nThe torrent sites are even better, these two sites have a ridiculous amount of music, so please go on there and download discographies worth of music.  I do need to keep a ratio on the sites, so please let me know if you download a ton.\nThe username for the following 2 sites is wisemaster\nthe password is daddy123\nhttps://www.waffles.fm/Main_Page you have to hit the login in the top left, it is disguised as a wiki site.\nhttp://what.cd/index.php this is the new site that has an incredibly powerful and large community.  I do need to be careful with my ratio at first, so try to stick to really popular artists on that site.\n\nLet me know what you think!\nNewzbin - Login\nNewzbin is a member-only site (see signup page). You need an account to proceed. Please do not contact us unless you are an existing member in need of assistance.\nnewzbin.com\n"

It is very important that you post them to my torrent server and not torrent them from Phoenix.  Only one location is allowed to be connected.  If the torrent.bjcullinan.com does not finish loading, you have to clear your cache by doing a CTRL+SHIFT+DELETE in Firefox.  Just cookies and active sessions have to be cleared.\n"
