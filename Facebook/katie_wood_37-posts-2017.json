POTUS Obama wrote a little more thoughtfully when he wrote, “I am grateful to Yad Vashem and all of those responsible for this remarkable institution. At a time of great peril and promise, war and strife, we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of man’s potential for great evil, but also our capacity to rise up from tragedy and remake our world. Let our children come here, and know this history, so that they can add their voices to proclaim ‘never again.’ And may we remember those who perished, not only as victims, but also as individuals who helped and loved and dreamed like us, and who have become symbols of the human spirit.\"      Barack Obama, 2008  I really miss having a POTUS with class and compassion.",

        "description": "Dobbie Shackleford I learned something important and am sharing it.  Feel free to copy and paste so others can learn \"non-alternative facts\", i.e. the Truth.  Shared from Williams Adkins:  I made a comment recently where I claimed that Republican administrations had been much more criminally corrupt over the last 50 plus years than the Democrats. I was challenged (dared actually) to prove it. So I did a bit of research and when I say a bit I mean it didn't take long and there is no comparison. When comparing criminal indictments of those serving in the executive branch of presidential administrations it's so lopsided as to be ridiculous. Yet all I ever hear is how corrupt the Democrats are. So why don't we break it down by president and the numbers.  Obama - 8yrs in office. zero criminal indictments, zero convictions and zero prison sentences. so the next time somebody describes the Obama administration as \"scandal free\" they aren't speaking wishfully, they're simply telling the truth.  Bush, George W. - 8yrs in office. 16 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 9 prison sentences.  Clinton - 8yrs in office. 2 criminal indictments. one conviction. one prison sentence. that's right nearly 8yrs of investigations. tens of millions spent and 30yrs of claiming them the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime.  Bush, George H. W. - 4yrs in office. one indictment. one conviction. one prison sentence.  Reagan - 8yrs in office. 26 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 8 prison sentences.  Carter - 4yrs in office. one indictment. zero convictions and zero prison sentences.  Ford - 2 1/2 yrs in office. one indictment and one conviction. one prison sentence.  Nixon - 6yrs in office. 76 criminal indictments. 55 convictions. 15 prison sentences.  Johnson - 5yrs in office. zero indictments. zero convictions. zero prison sentences.  So, let’s see where that leaves us. in the last 53 years Democrats have been in office for 25 of those years while Republicans held it for 28. in their 25yrs in office Democrats had a total of three executive branch officials indicted with one conviction and one prison sentence. that's one whole executive branch official convicted of a crime in two and a half decades of Democrat leadership.  In the 28yrs that Republicans have held office over the last 53yrs they have had a total of(a drum roll would be more than appropriate), 120 criminal indictments of executive branch officials. 89 criminal convictions and 34 prison sentences handed down. That's more prison sentences than years in office since 1968 for Republicans. If you want to count articles of impeachment as indictments (they aren't really but we can count them as an action), both sides get one more. However, Clinton wasn't found guilty while Nixon resigned and was pardoned by Ford. so those only serve to make Republicans look even worse.  With everything going on with Trump and his people right now, it's a safe bet Republicans are gonna be padding their numbers a bit real soon. So let's just go over the numbers one more time shall we. 120 indictments for Republicans. 89 convictions and 34 prison sentences. Those aren't \"feelings\" or \"alternate facts\" those are simply the stats by the numbers. Republicans are, and have been for my entire lifetime, the most criminally corrupt party to hold the office of the presidency.  Thanks Brenda",

Whether it’s up in the sky or here in your hands. And one day, it'll fall from the sky and hit you in the head real hard and that time, you won't have to put it back in the sky again.”   ― C.

        "description": "Debra Joy I respect law enforcement very much , admiring the courage and sacrifice such a job makes necessary and side effects such as depression, substance abuse that can also be a contributor to domestic violence , PTSD, etc ;  that pay and benefits can't come close to making it worjt it. All of that combined with being improperly trained which helps support the comradeship that makes up the always dangerous \"thin blue line\". Then of course they are humans and as in any group there's baddies. These baddies have attack dogs, tazers, billy clubs, guns and e EXTRA  baddies are sporting a power trip as well.     So don't ink it's worse and I don't think its new. I just think there's more attention on it and the media sells when a story is sensationalised.     It's the goodies that worry me most. They should be the people most outraged by this reversal of morals and honor befitting a LEO and raising F'N hell!!",

No big dramatic cause just to get back to reality briefly as social media can be a bit destructive to the real if you don't step away  If anyone needs to teach me my email is : catmom67@icloud.com.

        "description": "John E Citrone Aug. 22 - Jacksonville  Went to the Willowbranch Library this afternoon to grab a few Tom Clancy audio books when I witnessed something very disturbing. As I was walking up the stairs, a woman was walking in the opposite direction down the stairs. A man was following closely behind her, and near the base of the stairs, nonchalantly hooked his foot around hers and she went tumbling on to the landing below.   Not only did her books go everywhere, but a few landed on the sensor for the automatic sliding doors. The man pretended not to notice and walked through the doors, the poor woman remaining face down trying to gather her composure as the glass doors kept sliding open and closed, open and closed. I couldn't decide whether to run after the man or help the woman with her books. I leaned over to help the woman while shouting after the man, \"Dude what's the deal?!\" The woman had a rug burn on her cheek.",

        "description": "Bev Lockhart Citizens Against Homicide (CAH) is a non-profit, public benefits organization based in California. The group supports the friends and relatives of homicide victims by honoring the deceased, advocating for families seeking criminal justice for the murders, and supporting crime legislation that keeps the citizenry safe. CAH was cofounded in 1994 by Jane Alexander, whose thirteen-year search for the murderer of her 88-year-old aunt inspired the book Citizen Jane, and Jan Miller, ...  whose 19-year-old daughter Veronica was murdered in an unsolved 1984 case.[1] By 1998, the group had become active in all 50 U.S. states and had a mailing list into the thousands.[2] The group's membership actively assists the prosecution of murderers by writing letters to block the parole of convicted murderers and providing advice to families about the criminal justice system.
