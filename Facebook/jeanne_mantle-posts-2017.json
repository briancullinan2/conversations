Apparently this place used to be a bordello! AND it was built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground that was, at some point, dug up and the remains of the indians were ground up and used in the bricks of various buildings around Columbus (including the State House and the Jury Room). Also, I guess it flooded at one point and someone drowned in the basement. And the old bordello owner shot (and killed) someone there. It's got quite a sordid past! Who knew? And I'm only halfway through the episode.  Jeanne Mantle   April Hosfelt-Pierson   Diane Partin   Rodney A Wade",

        "description": "Angie Bindner  is with  Jeanne Mantle  and  63 others . To the Mothers I know- Happiness, like most things, comes from mothers.  An amniotic universe is rare.  Paradises aren't found with others,  Perhaps because we must breathe our own air.  Yet even after paradise, we find  Mothers are a bath of warm affection.  Only mothers' love is truly blind  To guarantee all errant souls protection.  However we find love, it can be only  Evanescences of memories  Retained from when we never could be lonely,  'Ere we left our mother's outsized knees.  So good it is to have that happiness  Designed to grace each subsequent caress,  All future love and joy to underlie,  Yearning backwards towards a mother's sigh. Angie Henley Bindner Angie Henley Bindner Angie",

I used to live next door to your cousins Marianne and Danny Mahoney on Piedmont Road.  I have no idea where you live but your cousin Marianne is living in Austin Texas.     The last time I saw her was in 1988 at her mother's funeral.  I was one of the pallbearers. She is buried very close to my parents in Saint Joseph Cemetery and very close to where I will be buried, although I hope it wont be for a very long time.     In 2010, I spent 3 months in a nursing home in Worthington recovering from foot surgery.  You cousin Bill Switzer was one of my roommates.  He was recovering from foot surgery.  His foot kept getting infected and eventually it was amputated.  He now has a prosthetic foot and seems to be able to walk okay.  Danny still lives the same home he lived in for a long time on Park Street in Victorian Village.     I have seen some of your family photos and you have a couple of very cute daughters.  I am not computer sophisticated and have no way of knowing how to put photos on Facebook if I wanted to.  Sincerely, Howard York",

        "description": "‎ Howard York ‎   to   Jeanne Mantle If you wish to call your cousin Marianne Mahoney, please call her in Austin, Texas at (512) 284-2588.  In circa 2009, she was forced to resign her long time position as a lecturer in political science due to a severe exacerbation of her asthma.  The biggest loss she ever had to suffer was 14 years ago when her then 14 year old son Mathew was killed by a Time-Warner van while riding his bicycle.  The van driver was at fault but knowing that her son was not at fault did not bring her son back to life.    Marianne has been through the mill.  She went through the mill just trying to have her to 2 children.  Prior to having her 2 children, she had 3 miscarriages.  She has been divorced for the last 13 years.  She needs a lot of moral support .  Please give her a call.",

        "description": "Randy Strong POLICE WARNING!! Police Warning Ladies: If you are a female, take heed! If you are male and have a significant female in your life who you care about, whether it's your wife, your girlfriend, your daughter, your sister, your niece, your cousin, your next door neighbor; whomever..............pass this along! Always, \"Be...tter safe than sorry!\" A man came over and offered his services as a painter to a female putting gas in her car and left his card. She said no, but accepted his card out of courtesy and got in her car. The man then got into a car driven by another gentleman. As the lady left the service station, she saw the men following her out of the station at the same time. Almost immediately, she started to feel dizzy and could not catch her breath. She tried to open the window and realized that the odor was on her hand; the same hand which accepted the card from the gentleman at   the gas station. She then noticed the men were immediately behind her and she felt she needed to do something at that moment. She drove into the first driveway and began to honk her horn repeatedly to ask for help. The men drove away but the lady still felt pretty bad for several minutes after she could finally catch her breath. Apparently, there was a substance on the card that could have seriously injured her. This drug is called 'BURUNDANGA' and it is used by people who wish to incapacitate a victim in order to steal from or take advantage of them. This drug is four times more dangerous than the date rape drug and is transferable on simple cards. So take heed and make sure you don't accept cards at any given time you are alone or from someone on the streets. This applies to those making house calls and slipping you a card when they offer their services. PLEASE SEND THIS E-MAIL ALERT   TO EVERY FEMALE/MALE YOU KNOW!!!! Sgt. Gregory L. Joyner Internal Affairs Unit Louisville Metro Department of Corrections 400 South 6th Street Louisville , Ky 40202 Office: ( 502) 574-7213See More.",

If you know his cell phone number---the same one for 15 years,you may want to just give him a call to pass the time. He has good days and bad,so keep that in mind if he doesn't want to talk. He needs to know that he has a lot of people pulling for him . I don't know his room phone number but you can get connected by the hospital operator at 614 293 8000.

Bob has been steadily declining over the past month with liver failure and all the complications that comes with it.We have spent more time at OSU Doan Hall in the last month than we have been at home. Although he has been on the transplant list for several months now, I never truly believed that he would get one. Friday night when I went to bring him home, the nurses said he had surgery scheduled in the morning---he was getting a liver!  It was a match,and by 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon he was in recovery. It is still a long road ahead,but at least we are headed up the path to recovery! Keep us in your thoughts and prayers,as I am still in shock over the events of the last 48 hours.",
