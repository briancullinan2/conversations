Thanks pop for all the music you exposed me to. Never had a \"lip\" for trumpet as my old friend and trumpet player Barry Berman used to say. His pop played trumpet for the Sonny Costanza orchestra.  Great stuff out there in archived video.",

        "description": "Daniel Glass On September 30th, we celebrated what would have been Buddy Rich's 99th Birthday.  If you have not heard the following clip of Buddy, prepare to have your mind sufficiently blown. It features the 12-year old child star performing John Philip Sousa's \"Stars and Stripes Forever\" on the Vaudeville stage in 1929.  As you would expect, the drumming is impeccable, and all the more impressive when you realize that at this point, Buddy had already been one of Vaudeville's highest paid child stars for more than a decade!  As a historical document, this clip is also an excellent example of what we would call \"Ragtime drumming.\" In an era before the hi hat or ride cymbal were in widespread use, drummers did all their timekeeping solely on the snare and bass drum (with a few \"traps\" for added flavor). Ragtime drummers \"swung\" traditional military rudiments, often improvising on them with incredible virtuosity. This tradition goes back to the late 1800s and belies the commonly held misconception that there were no recorded drum solos or features prior to Gene Krupa's work with Benny Goodman in the 1930s.  Pay attention to Buddy's nimble footwork - he exhibits incredible control and dexterity on the bass drum at a time when most drummers stuck with a more traditional \"1 & 3\" as laid out by military tradition. And remember, Buddy was able to pull all this off while standing up and playing a bass drum that was 30\" or more in diameter!  Lastly, make sure to read the captions that accompanying this clip. They offer many more fascinating tidbits about the life of what was undoubtedly the most celebrated drummer of all time.  Last night I had the honor of participating in a terrific radio tribute to Buddy -  Around The Kit , co-hosted by Joe Gansas and Buddy's daughter  Cathy Rich . Some amazing names on the bill, including  Dave Weckl ,  Kenny Aronoff ,  Gregg Potter Fan Page ,  Matt Sorum ,  Rod Morgenstein  and  Dom Famularo .

        "description": "Julie Hewat  is with  Ignacio Rodriguez  in  Pisac - Valle Sagrado, Cusco . Once in a while, you stumble across a random serendipitous treasure… Ignacio is such a treasure.  Ignacio Rodriguez, is an incredible multi talented musician based in the Sacred Valley in Peru. Ignacio shares his music by wetransfer (internet platform to send audio files directly to the buyer's mail, easy and fast to download) He has 5 different albums to offer. Enquiries and contact to purchase Nacho's music can be made via facebook at  Nacho hang , email, youtube bandcamp or website.   Web:  www.nachohang.com  email: planetahang@gmail.com  bandcamp:  www.ignaciorodriguezmusic.bandcamp.com    Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lscerFSToNM  We met Nacho in the laneway in Pisac, I asked him if he would play something for us and in his own kind and gentle way, he did, I just filmed it on my phone... this is what he played.  I never realised then that this little video would be shared and viewed so many times, by so many people from all around the world. As I type, this has had close to 5 million views [close to a million just in the last few days!] and over 100 thousand shares, from this post alone... this is over and above the millions of views from it being taken over and shared by thousands of others.   I would like to hope that at least some of you who have enjoyed and shared this will show some appreciation, gratitude and support for Nacho hang in his creation of his art.  Many of those who have seen or shared this are sending through friend requests... hundreds of them! It's a little humbling.... and a little overwhelming... and I just can't accept them all. If I don't, please dont take it personally. If I do, welcome.  Thank you for reaching out, I see you and I'm grateful.

In the early hours of 25 December, a Russian Defence Ministry plane carrying 93 people, including 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble Choir, went down off the coast of Sochi, Russia while en route to Latakia, Syria for a Christmas celebration with troops deployed at a military base. The plane crashed with no survivors.   The Alexandrov Ensemble Choir is the official choir of the Russian armed forces and one of the two choirs that can carry the title Red Army Choir. It has a repertoire of over 2,000 songs and is well-embedded in Russia's rich cultural heritage. Until now, the choir was composed of 186 people.",
