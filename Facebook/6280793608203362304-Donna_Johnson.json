I have a client that is asking me to find a PHP Developer and I'd like to discuss it with you if possible. Also, I noticed that you did a Raspberry Pi project and I'm very interested in picking your brain about that if I could. I have another client that is talking to us about a need for a Pi professional and to be honest with you, it is not a technology that I am overly familiar with. I've been recruiting a long time but haven't had anyone ask for this before. So, it would be interesting to chat with you.\n\nThank you for your time and I look forward to your response.\n\nDonna Johnson\nSolu Technology Partners\nScottsdale, AZ\n602-723-1120 | djohnson@solutechnology.com\n"
