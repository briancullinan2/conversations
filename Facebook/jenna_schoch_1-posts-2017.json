        "description": "Jordan Hedges Jenna  and I just got the final achievement in Everlasting Summer.  It's a bizarre Russian dating sim that's free on Steam. The writing is .... well it has lines like, \"I bit my lip until it bled\" which should sum up the quality.  It makes up for that in creativity though. I'm talking Undertale levels of meta game story telling. It's absolutely worth checking out to explore all the endings.   It's also very well put together from a user experience perspective. You can easily fast forward through scenes you've completed already and it always stops the moment you start a scene you haven't played yet. So going back to try new possibilities is super easy.  There's also boobs. Plenty of boobs. Have fun!  EDIT:  I should mention, the Steam version removes said boobs, but the developers have a patch on their website that's super easy to install and restore the boobs.",

They brought in two audience members every time there was a mini game and divided the audience up so they could shout out what to do for the other two players.   They goofed and messed up the projector at one point so there was a brief Q&A while Vernon scrambled around trying to fix it.  We also got a sweet signed poster and sat super close.

XCOM 2 UPDATE  I thought it would be fun to introduce the characters our drawing winners (along with  Jenna  and I) have created so far and give a report on how they're doing.  Listed in the order the screenshots decided to upload:  A Pet Named Steve - Created by  Jenna  Currently our biggest bad ass in spite of the lack of protection hefting a gatling gun and grenade launcher.  Arin Hansen - Created by  Jenna  One of our favorite YouTubers perfectly recreated for XCOM. He even had an Arin-esque meltdown when he got shot once.  Jean Borotra - Created by  Jackson  He's only been on one mission, but has already proven himself as an extremely useful field medic thanks to his GREMLIN droid that can zip over to nearby allies and heal them.  Alexandra McSnugglekins - Created by  Michael  Has already won me over thanks to her excellent mobility and morale-boosting charm.  Jade MacBrady - Created by me  Completely unstoppable in melee combat thanks to the battle axes she recently acquired (not pictured), but pretty reckless. Has had her life saved by Jean TWICE already.  Conn Seanery - Created by  Eddie  Quite handsome, but seriously needs to work on his aim. Even still, he has the potential to be our best sniper.",

I'm going to customize one for myself and  Jenna  is going to do one too. So over the next few days I'll be doing six random drawings.  So far those of you who seemed to be interested (based on likes and comments) in naming a soldier are:   Michael Eickstaedt   Michael Middleton   Gregory Bloom   Eddie Altherr   Johannes Baker   Theo Hedges   Lorenzo Hill   Kevin Theiss   Matthew Wray   Jackson Klinefelter   Aram Zucker-Scharff   Joseph Burks  If you don't see your name and want to join in, let me know. If I listed you and you are not interested, just tell me and I'll take you off the list. No pressure.",

I bought a new upgrade that gave everyone in the squad more armor, which lowers the chance of them dying due to one of my many poor tactical decisions.  What I didn't anticipate was for this to be a cosmetic change as well. This has EXTREMELLY limited the customization options, so unfortunately soldiers in a tank top and bootie shorts are a thing of the past.  :(  Let me know in this post if you'd like anything on your characters changed. I'll try to post a video with the more limited customization options soon.",

Not being particularly big on MY birthday celebration as the years go by, my usual drill the last few years is a day to myself at the spa, to rejuvenate, relax, reflect and contemplate the coming year. With Michael's birthday the day after mine, it is also a time to remember.  This year's birthday was really fun with a new chapter unfolding, being in business for myself and doing more of what I really enjoy. So I did break from the routine a bit, at Carol's insistence booked a Thai massage - OMG talk about stretching! And ended up suspended upside down in the aerial yoga class - it looked like too much fun but it was a workout - I pretty much sweated through my shirt by the end of that, good thing the Well & Being Spa has a cold dip... then yesterday breakfast at my favorite Matt's Big Breakfast with Teddy and the kids then we went to see Billy Elliott at the Phoenix Theater. Being on the front row for such an emotional show was intense - the music is so passionate and the cast was amazing, giving it their all for the final performance.   All in all, a nice sense of closure for 2016 and a great start to the new year. Blessings to you all.",

Michael Eickstaedt 's character, Alexandra McSnugglekins, has become the ultimate ninja. She's been incredibly handy for timed missions where I need someone to slip past the enemies and complete an objective.   Matthew Wray 's character, Kurt Hectic, is getting the hang of his new sniping gig.   Jenna 's character, A Pet Named Steve, is miraculously still kicking ass with no armor.   Michael Middleton 's character, Alexis Sanchez, now has an exo suit with a wrist-mounted rocket launcher.    Theo Hedges 's character, Lena Lethal, is a force of pure destruction.  I gave  Jackson  the right to customize a new soldier I got as a mission reward. His instructions were \"Make him Vegeta.\"",

        "description": "Jordan Hedges Played a lot of XCOM 2 today.  UPDATE TIME!  The whole crew contributed to a special mission where the command ship was disabled and everyone had to defend the ship.   Matthew 's character, Kurt Hectic, completed his sniper training and went on his first mission. That mission was a rescue op to retrieve Arin Hanson, one of  Jenna 's characters who was captured a while ago.  I have way too many snipers.  Colorado Denverson,  Joseph Box 's character has completed his ranger training and will likely be on a mission soon.  I also had a bit of a panic because the Avatar Project meter, which can end the game once it's full, got filled!   I had 20 days to try and lower it so I put all my time and resources into making contact with a region close enough to an alien facility. Raiding facilities brings the meter down and thankfully the one I chose took it down by 2!  The adventure continues soon. I'll let you all know once it's time to start another random drawing for new character names.",

A Glee reunion (Gleeunion?) on a tv show where they're all super heroes?That sounded like a recipe for an amazing thing to watch. It wasn't. Here's why:  - Barely any singing. Darren Criss sang like two lines and the songs that were there were not great. How do you screw up an amazing idea like, \"Two superheroes sing a song called I'm Your Super Friend\" so BADLY.  - The Flash and Supergirl were transported to a dream world that was a musical. They weren't actually made to sing by the Music Meister.  - He wasn't even the Music Meister! He was just some alien that the Flash called the Music Meister as a nickname and the only reason they were transported to a musical world was because Barry Allen likes musicals, which as far as I can tell was established for the first time in this episode.  I feel like I need to watch the Music Meister episode of Batman Brave and the Bold to clean out my brain.",

        "description": "Jordan Hedges  added  11 new photos . Today's quest was a complete disaster.  The fishmen and other eldritch horrors of The Cove proved to be too much for the group of newcomers I sent.   Regina 's Man-At-Arms Duncan lost all hope early on.  Richard 's Antiquarian Ekene-Ata and the Abomination Eileen became irrational thanks to the fishmen that specifically inflict massive stress damage.   Jenna 's Houndmaster Brent rose to the challenge and became focused, but it was not enough to save his companions.  Both Eileen and Duncan fell to heart attacks.  With Ekene-Ata barely alive and half the party dead, I had no choice but to abandon the quest.  Brent is at the Brothel and Ekene-Ata is being flagellated at the Abbey, the only stress relief she'll partake in.  We will recover from this loss and press on. We're now at 3 out of the possible 16 deaths before this playthrough is over.  I'll be drawing names for our next two unlucky heroes in a moment.",
