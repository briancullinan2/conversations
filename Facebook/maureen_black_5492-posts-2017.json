        "description": "Warren Lynch Bernie's response to the Donna Brazile revelations:  \"Politics is not a baseball game, and it is not a soap opera.  People are hurting in this country, and our job is not to be distracted by political gossip and Donald Trump's tweets. Our job is to revitalize American democracy and bring millions of people into the political process who today do not vote and who do not believe that government is relevant to their lives. Our job is to create an economy and government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent and wealthy campaign contributors.  Here's the problem: the strategy the Democratic Party has been pursuing in recent years has failed. Since 2009, Democrats have lost more than 1,000 seats in state legislatures across the country. Republicans now control the White House, 34 out of 50 governorships as well as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In dozens of states, the Democratic Party is virtually non-existent. Too much is at stake for our country and our people for us not to learn from our past failures and move forward in a way that makes the Democratic Party stronger so we can take on and beat Trump and the right-wing Republican agenda.  What the recently released book excerpt from former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile made clear is that unless we get our act together, we are not going to be effective in either taking on Donald Trump or in stopping the extremist right-wing Republican agenda. We have to re-establish faith with the American people that in fact we can make positive changes in this country through a fair and transparent political process that reflects the will of voters across this country.  In order to do that, we need to rethink and rebuild the Democratic Party. We need a Democratic Party that opens its doors to new people, new energy and new ideas. We need a Democratic Party that is truly a grassroots party, where decisions are made from the bottom up, not from the top down. We need a Democratic Party which becomes the political home of the working people and young people of this country, black and white, Latino and Asian and Native American ... all Americans.  And we need to make it abundantly clear that the Democratic Party is prepared to take on the ideology of the Koch brothers and the billionaire class – a small group of people who are undermining American democracy and moving this country into an oligarchic form of society. YES. We will take on the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, corporate America, the insurance industry, the drug companies, and the fossil fuel industry.  Now, what the Establishment (political, economic and media) wants us to believe is that real and fundamental changes in our society are impossible.  No. We cannot guarantee health care to all as a right. No. We cannot revitalize the trade union movement, raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour and provide pay equity for women. No. We cannot effectively compete in the global economy by making public colleges and universities tuition-free. No. We cannot lead the world in combatting climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels. No. We cannot reform our broken criminal justice system or finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform.  They want us to think that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a nation which has more income and wealth inequality than almost any nation on earth, the best that we can do is to accept tiny, incremental change.  I could not disagree more.  Right now, a Democratic National Committee Unity Reform Commission, comprised of people who supported our campaign, people who supported Secretary Clinton's campaign, and people appointed by DNC Chair Tom Perez are working on a set of policies that will determine the future direction of the Democratic Party. In many ways, this Unity Commission will determine whether the Party goes forward in a dynamic and inclusive way, or whether it retains the failed status quo approach of recent years. It will determine whether the Party will have the grassroots energy to effectively take on Donald Trump, the Republican Party and their reactionary agenda or whether we remain in the minority.  In my view, this Commission must:  * Make the Democratic Party more democratic and the presidential contests more fair by dramatically reducing the number of superdelegates who participate in the nominating process. It is absurd that in the last presidential primary over 700 superdelegates (almost one-third of the delegates a candidate needed to win the nomination) had the power to ignore the will of the people who voted in the state primaries and caucuses.  * Make primaries more open by ending the absurdity of closed primary systems with antiquated, arbitrary and discriminatory voter registration laws. Republicans are the ones who make it harder for people to vote, not Democrats. At a time when more and more people consider themselves to be Independents our job is to bring people into the Democratic Party process, not exclude them. It is incredibly undemocratic that in some states voters must declare their party affiliation up to six months before the primary election.  * Make it easier for working people and students to participate in state caucuses. While there is much to be said for bringing people together face-to-face in a caucus to discuss why they support the candidate of their choice, not everybody is able to attend those caucuses at the time they are held. A process must be developed that gives everyone the right to cast a vote even if they are not physically able to attend a state caucus.  * Make the DNC's budget and decision-making processes more open and transparent. If we are going to build a Party that relies on working people who are willing to give $5, $10 and $27 donations, they deserve to know where that money is going and how those decisions are made.  I look forward to following the progress of the Unity Reform Commission, and I urge Chairman Tom Perez and the entire Democratic National Committee to develop policies which move the Democratic Party forward in a very different direction – a direction that will lead us to national and statewide victories. It's important that you do the same:  Please sign the petition calling on the Democratic National Committee and Chairman Tom Perez to accept, support and implement policies which make the Democratic Party more inclusive, more democratic and more transparent.  Right now, our job is to come together, and not be distracted by the political gossip and drama of the moment. We must fight President Trump's destructive efforts to divide us up by the color of our skin, our gender, our religion, our sexual orientation or our country of origin. We must rally the American people to oppose Trump's proposal to provide massive tax giveaways to billionaires while taking away the health care that millions now have.  But we must also make it clear – if we are going to elect Democrats who will move us forward as a country – that we must institute long-needed reforms in the Democratic Party. When we do that, we will not only create a dynamic and progressive party, we will be able to transform our nation and create a government that represents all of us, not just the people on top.  In solidarity,  Bernie Sanders\" Patti Reilly Casey Mehran",

        "description": "Warren Lynch Bernie's response to the Donna Brazile revelations:  \"Politics is not a baseball game, and it is not a soap opera.  People are hurting in this country, and our job is not to be distracted by political gossip and Donald Trump's tweets. Our job is to revitalize American democracy and bring millions of people into the political process who today do not vote and who do not believe that government is relevant to their lives. Our job is to create an economy and government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent and wealthy campaign contributors.  Here's the problem: the strategy the Democratic Party has been pursuing in recent years has failed. Since 2009, Democrats have lost more than 1,000 seats in state legislatures across the country. Republicans now control the White House, 34 out of 50 governorships as well as the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In dozens of states, the Democratic Party is virtually non-existent. Too much is at stake for our country and our people for us not to learn from our past failures and move forward in a way that makes the Democratic Party stronger so we can take on and beat Trump and the right-wing Republican agenda.  What the recently released book excerpt from former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile made clear is that unless we get our act together, we are not going to be effective in either taking on Donald Trump or in stopping the extremist right-wing Republican agenda. We have to re-establish faith with the American people that in fact we can make positive changes in this country through a fair and transparent political process that reflects the will of voters across this country.  In order to do that, we need to rethink and rebuild the Democratic Party. We need a Democratic Party that opens its doors to new people, new energy and new ideas. We need a Democratic Party that is truly a grassroots party, where decisions are made from the bottom up, not from the top down. We need a Democratic Party which becomes the political home of the working people and young people of this country, black and white, Latino and Asian and Native American ... all Americans.  And we need to make it abundantly clear that the Democratic Party is prepared to take on the ideology of the Koch brothers and the billionaire class – a small group of people who are undermining American democracy and moving this country into an oligarchic form of society. YES. We will take on the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior of Wall Street, corporate America, the insurance industry, the drug companies, and the fossil fuel industry.  Now, what the Establishment (political, economic and media) wants us to believe is that real and fundamental changes in our society are impossible.  No. We cannot guarantee health care to all as a right. No. We cannot revitalize the trade union movement, raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour and provide pay equity for women. No. We cannot effectively compete in the global economy by making public colleges and universities tuition-free. No. We cannot lead the world in combatting climate change and transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels. No. We cannot reform our broken criminal justice system or finally achieve comprehensive immigration reform.  They want us to think that in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a nation which has more income and wealth inequality than almost any nation on earth, the best that we can do is to accept tiny, incremental change.  I could not disagree more.  Right now, a Democratic National Committee Unity Reform Commission, comprised of people who supported our campaign, people who supported Secretary Clinton's campaign, and people appointed by DNC Chair Tom Perez are working on a set of policies that will determine the future direction of the Democratic Party. In many ways, this Unity Commission will determine whether the Party goes forward in a dynamic and inclusive way, or whether it retains the failed status quo approach of recent years. It will determine whether the Party will have the grassroots energy to effectively take on Donald Trump, the Republican Party and their reactionary agenda or whether we remain in the minority.  In my view, this Commission must:  * Make the Democratic Party more democratic and the presidential contests more fair by dramatically reducing the number of superdelegates who participate in the nominating process. It is absurd that in the last presidential primary over 700 superdelegates (almost one-third of the delegates a candidate needed to win the nomination) had the power to ignore the will of the people who voted in the state primaries and caucuses.  * Make primaries more open by ending the absurdity of closed primary systems with antiquated, arbitrary and discriminatory voter registration laws. Republicans are the ones who make it harder for people to vote, not Democrats. At a time when more and more people consider themselves to be Independents our job is to bring people into the Democratic Party process, not exclude them. It is incredibly undemocratic that in some states voters must declare their party affiliation up to six months before the primary election.  * Make it easier for working people and students to participate in state caucuses. While there is much to be said for bringing people together face-to-face in a caucus to discuss why they support the candidate of their choice, not everybody is able to attend those caucuses at the time they are held. A process must be developed that gives everyone the right to cast a vote even if they are not physically able to attend a state caucus.  * Make the DNC's budget and decision-making processes more open and transparent. If we are going to build a Party that relies on working people who are willing to give $5, $10 and $27 donations, they deserve to know where that money is going and how those decisions are made.  I look forward to following the progress of the Unity Reform Commission, and I urge Chairman Tom Perez and the entire Democratic National Committee to develop policies which move the Democratic Party forward in a very different direction – a direction that will lead us to national and statewide victories. It's important that you do the same:  Please sign the petition calling on the Democratic National Committee and Chairman Tom Perez to accept, support and implement policies which make the Democratic Party more inclusive, more democratic and more transparent.  Right now, our job is to come together, and not be distracted by the political gossip and drama of the moment. We must fight President Trump's destructive efforts to divide us up by the color of our skin, our gender, our religion, our sexual orientation or our country of origin. We must rally the American people to oppose Trump's proposal to provide massive tax giveaways to billionaires while taking away the health care that millions now have.  But we must also make it clear – if we are going to elect Democrats who will move us forward as a country – that we must institute long-needed reforms in the Democratic Party. When we do that, we will not only create a dynamic and progressive party, we will be able to transform our nation and create a government that represents all of us, not just the people on top.  In solidarity,  Bernie Sanders\" Patti Reilly Casey Mehran",

        "description": "‎ Melinda McCracken ‎   to   Alameda Unified School District The banning of Black Lives Matter signage is in violation of the First Amendment. Nowhere in the Bill of Rights does it say \"except if you are under 18\" or \"except on public school property.\" You are teaching these children that they are second class citizens. How is that preparation for success?   You claim that African American disenfranchisement is \"an outside issue.\" What, then, is relevant to your students' lives now and in the future? How many of your students have already experienced the effects of bigotry? How much of it is right there in your schools? What are you doing about it, if anything?  Sweeping the issue under the rug will not make it go away. It is shocking that you are not nurturing an open dialog which, experience has shown, promotes understanding and can have a mitigating effect on the anger that too often results in violence on campuses across the country.    We, the citizens of California, will not let you try to pretend it doesn't affect your students every day. We won't let you prevent them from speaking out at school, where they live the majority of the time. If necessary, we will picket your district offices. We will also circulate a petition calling for the removal of all those who voted in favor of silencing free speech.  Please reconsider your decision and reverse your position. We are watching, and we WILL act.   Sincerely,   Melinda McCracken   Oakland native and concerned California voter Melinda McCracken",

Trump already surpassed Obama’s murderous record with numbers as high as 4,500 civilian deaths. Trump followed through on his promise to \"bomb the hell out of ISIS,\" and killed more innocent civilians in 9 months than Obama did. While the \"news\" focuses on anything BUT the current state of US intervention in the Middle East, Trump is breaking records by accumulating a horrific number of civilian deaths.

Corporations are still allowed to deduct more than $10,000 in property taxes. Homeowners are not. Corporations are still allowed to deduct moving expenses. Families are not.   And this is on top of a $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut.  Let's be clear, this is not a \"middle-class tax cut.\" Working families get the crumbs and the super-wealthy get everything else.",

        "description": "Sherry L Lottig  shared a  link . Trump's tax plan is a sham to transfer more wealth to the billionaire class.   If the goal of the new tax plan is to shift the tax burden from wealthy, older Americans onto young, already-indebted students pursuing their higher education dreams, it's poised to be a smashing success. But from the perspective of someone who's been a graduate student, gotten their Ph.D., and then been a professor for many years, it looks like a ploy. The ploy appears to be to destroy higher education, to shift the tax burden onto the most educated rather than the most financially successful, and to disincentivize graduate school as a viable option for the majority of people who'd choose to pursue it otherwise.

While visiting the State House in Olympia, I thought about what the people of Washington vote for when they cast their ballots. Getting their kids a great education, keeping our parks clean and open, creating opportunities for small business, and taking care of our people. As I reflect on this, I am proud to have an opportunity to try and represent the will of the people of Washington.  Let's Do Bold Things  # Together",

        "description": "Michael Beattie The Congressional Budget Office Just Released A Bombshell On Trump’s Tax Bill shares  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has released its verdict on the GOP’s new tax bill: analysis found that, if implemented, the new Republican tax plan would add $1.7 trillion to the country’s overall debt.  The GOP has been attempting for decades to reform the tax system. The main aspect of their tax ideology is cutting taxes for the nation’s wealthiest and corporate entities. GOP leaders believe that doing so will incentivize the nation’s wealthy to reinvest their capital into the economy. However, many lawmakers and experts have criticized this approach simply because the lower classes are bound to feel more of an effect on their income. In other words, 30% to someone who is a multi-millionaire is not as impactful as it is to someone earning 50 thousand a year.  Though the proposed rate for top earners remains the same in this bill (39.6%), the tax rate for the lowest bracket ($0-19,000) would increase by 2%. Adding extra burden individuals and families who are already struggling. This would be done all while reducing the tax rate for corporations by 15%.  To make matters worse, the CBO analysis also finds that the nation’s debt burden (debt-to-GDP ratio) would rise to 97.1% by 2027 if this bill is passed. That is 5.9 points higher than what is currently projected for that year: 91.2%.  Despite all of its obvious issues, GOP lawmakers in D.C plan to push forward with this bill. There is a significant chance that the new tax plan will become law because it is backed by the White House and because the Republicans currently control Congress.",

Then good old Regan and his cronies decided to again stick it to us and taxed it and put a limit on what we could earn after retirement the they decided to play around with the COLA. So now the are screwing with Medicare money we also pay. ENOUGH already!\" Julie Lannom   \"Also decided we needed to work much longer to get it, at least the full amount. I understand that they have desk jobs, good lifetime health insurance , etc but I do not. My job is hard! Physically hard, every day. I'm an excellent nurse but dang!

        "description": "Jake Davis I am so psyched that progressive groups proved that they are a force to be reckoned with yesterday. Working in tandem...DSA, Working Families, and Our Revolution showed that the country is thirsting for real change. These groups have also been willing to work with the Democratic Party but have shown no qualms in going at it alone.   If it turns out that the Democratic Party is unable to be reformed (which seems likely) it is going to be essential that we have a consolidated force that can pose a legitimate threat to the duopoly. This is why I think Leftists that aren't working towards reform should throw their support behind DSA. Throughout the country yesterday, the Green Party ran 123 different candidates throughout the country...they won 6 of the races, 4 of which were in CA. DSA won in Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Knoxville, among other places. At what point do we suggest that Greens disband and coordinate with DSA? The Greens have been saddled with a stigma for years and I don't think they recover from it. I just don't want to see progressives who largely agree on the issues end up squabbling over party identity. My hope is that consolidation will bring the solidarity necessary to form a successful coalition in the future. This was just a thought I had today...I voted Green last year but I was supremely disappointed with the result and the behavior of the toxic element within the party. I think it might be time to throw in the towel on the Green Party... 🤷‍♂️",
