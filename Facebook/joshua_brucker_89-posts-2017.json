        "description": "Joshua Brucker Today marks a very special day for me.  50 days ago, I opened my eyes and found myself staring up at the ceiling of a solitary holding cell 700 miles away from home. I was laying on a thin rubber mat, no thicker than a mattress pad. It was cold but I was okay with it. I rolled over and at the other side of the room and sitting open was a hatch, with a cold cup of coffee and a granola bar sitting on it. The night before, I was arrested and charged with a DUI in Minnesota.  That day was the beginning of the rest of my life. For an entire 3 years before then, I had allowed myself to slip back into a place I had sworn I’d never find myself again. It was a gradual process, becoming familiar with alcohol again. For a good while, I’d admit I had a handle on it. But depression comes easy to me, we’ve been good friends since I was little. It’s so strange to look back now, how content I was with feeling alone and isolated. I wanted that again, oddly enough.  Because of this, I pushed those close to me away and ruined friendships I had built for years. I drank for many reasons. I drank because I felt guilt for hurting others because of my drinking. I drank when ever something good happened in my life. I drank when I watched a movie or while enjoying a good meal. I drank around people because my anxiety wouldn’t allow me to socialize otherwise. Eventually, I couldn’t do those things without having a drink or many, actually. It became difficult to do almost any extracurricular activity without involving alcohol somehow. By the end of it, that was all that was on my mind; I needed it because by the end of the day, I’d be irritable and angry without it.  But that day, 50 days ago, was when I had enough. I wish I could say it was because of the hurt I caused my loved ones. I wish I could say it was because I was destroying my health. Sitting in that cell put it into perspective. This is what everyone had warned me about. This was always going to be my rock bottom and unfortunately, there was no other way around it. It needed to happen. I knew at that point everyone was right, that my selfish and reckless actions would come to haunt me, and they were correct.  I’m so terribly sorry to anyone that I’ve hurt because of my issues. I’m so terribly sorry to anyone I let down or failed in any way. And I don’t expect the apology to be accepted but just know that my actions were done in a selfish manner, a character defect I’m working hard to correct.  I wish I could say it’s been an easy 50 days. It certainly hasn’t. I’m filled with guilt and shame, but rightfully so in a way. I’ve had to cut certain people from my life that I love dearly. My DUI was resolved on October 30th, with an outcome that’s less than desirable. I was sentenced to 90 days in jail, 120 hours of community service, a hefty fine, 4 years of probation, and ordered to go to treatment. My Chevy Cruze was seized and forfeited by the state of Minnesota. My drivers license was revoked for one year and all vehicles registered in my name were suspended, and I’m not allowed to own a vehicle until I can show proof that I’ve carried SR22 insurance for 36 consecutive months.  But I’m still alive and loved by those close to me. No one gave up on me, even when I didn’t think I deserved it. I don’t want to name names, or point them out directly, but I couldn’t have done it without you and your love and strength guiding me through all of this because this would’ve lead me down a darker path without you. I have my health, a good set of friends, and a new perspective on life. Many people may wonder why I’m being so candid about this. I understand people enjoy gossiping, and some will gossip about this. So if they are to, I’d rather them know for certain what it is they’re talking about.  But most importantly, I want anyone reading this to know it’s never too late to be a better person. No matter how terrible life can be sometimes, there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes it takes a lot to realize that, sometimes it doesn’t, but you will realize it one day. And I’m not speaking only towards drug or alcohol dependency; anything that currently has its grasp on you, remember that it’s not going to last but you have to want that change. And remember you’re never alone, that no matter how bad things are, others are there for you.  Life gets better. One day at a time, it will get better. Trust me on this. If you ever need anyone to talk to, I’ll be here to listen if no one else is.  We all struggle with things, but what’s important is how we’re there for one another.  Keep looking up, because it isn’t over just yet.   # KeepOnMoving   # SoberLife Joshua",
