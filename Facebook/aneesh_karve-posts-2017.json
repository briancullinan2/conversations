Why are we asked to invest trillions of our money into a super-corporation with guns, a history of murder, scarcely any voting rights for its investors, zero accountability, and a penchant for waste?",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve Our grandchildren will laugh at the idea of government the same way that today's children laugh at rotary phones. Government is an antiquated idea that evolved when information and access were scarce. In this way, the Internet has already killed government. But the behemoth will die slowly. If this seems like an extreme view, recall that things which seemed to be essential in the last century (slaves, newspapers, paper money, horse-drawn carriages) are now considered irrelevant and even harmful.  What we call \"today's news\" is just the death throes of a system of defunct governments that will take a few decades to disappear.  Government has no money (except what it robs from its populace), no intelligence (this one is obvious), and no power of its own (other than what we give it). Crowdfunding and digital currencies are an important stepping stone to a system where sovereign individuals will collaborate and act at scale without any need for a centralized authority.

        "description": "Robert Reich May I have a word with those of you Bernie supporters who consider Donald Trump to be no worse than Hillary Clinton? It’s a point of view a number of you have expressed on this page, and it's dead wrong.    As I said when I endorsed Bernie for president, I view Hillary as enormously qualified to be president of the political system we now have. She is smart, capable, and experienced. I endorsed Bernie because I thought he would help create the political system we need. But Bernie will not be the Democratic nominee. That does not mean the end of the movement Bernie advanced. That movement was never about Bernie; it was about reclaiming our democracy and our economy. And that movement will live on, and it will grow. It needs your continuing activism and your tenacity.   You are, of course, entitled to support anyone you wish to. But if you don’t get behind Hillary you increase the odds that Donald Trump will be president. That would be a disaster for America and the world. Trump is a menace. He is not just unsuited to being the president of the United States – a bigoted narcissist who incites and excuses violence – but his presidency would threaten everything this nation stands for: tolerance, inclusion, freedom of the press, equal justice, and equal opportunity. It would make it far more difficult ever to achieve the progressive goals you and I share.   What do you think? Bernie Sanders Jill Stein Robert Reich Bernie Sanders Robert Reich U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders",

        "description": "Robert Reich Trump has pardoned Joe Arpaio, the notorious former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona. Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order requiring him to stop racially profiling Latinos during traffic stops and detentions. He had faced up to six years in prison.   Arpaio's aggressive tactics became the model for anti-immigrant demagogues, including Trump. In fact, Arpaio was one of Trump's earliest supporters, endorsing him for president early in the camp ... aign.  With this pardon, it's clear that Trump doesn’t care about the courts or the Constitution. Just as with his remarks last week in Charlottesville, he’s intent on dividing America for political gain.   This is yet another example of how far Trump will go to embolden hate in America for his own benefit. Shame on him, and all his enablers.  Shame on every one of us who doesn't do everything possible to lawfully remove from office this loathsome man and utter disgrace of a president.   What do you think?   See More Ryan J. Reilly Ryan J.

        "description": "Robert Reich An update on the Mueller investigation. His team has upped the pressure on Trump.   1) Mueller wants Paul Manafort's business partners to testify before a grand jury. Before joining the Trump campaign, Manafort ran an international consulting firm that lobbied on behalf of pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. In July, federal agents also raided Manafort's home.  2) Mueller has also deepened his inquiry into Michael Flynn's connection to Republican financier Peter W. Smith. Last fa ... ll, Smith assembled a team of computer experts to contact hackers connected with the Russian government, in order to get emails he believed had been hacked from Hillary Clinton’s private server, according to the Wall Street Journal. Smith told multiple people he was working with Flynn.   These updates come as Trump has reportedly put pressure on Senate Republicans to drop legislation that would limit his ability to fire Mueller. Trump wants to make this investigation go away, but Mueller hasn't relented. As Trump is backed into a corner, there's no telling how we will react.   What do you think?

Now, we know where some of that money has gone. The agency spent:   1) $7,100 to rent luxury portable toilets during Trump's recent vacation at his Bedminster golf club.   2) $60,000 on golf cart rentals at Trump's properties. ...  3) $12,000 for Trump to attend the Super Bowl.   These figures of course are small in comparison to what the agency has spent to ferry Trump's children around the world on business trips. For example, Eric Trump's junket to Uruguay cost the agency over $100,000. Other jaunts on the taxpayers' dime have included the Dominican Republic, Dubai, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

But actually, fifteen years after an attack that killed more than 3,000 Americans, Congress has declassified 28 pages from the 9/11 commission report. In short, there is evidence that elements of the Saudi government funded the 9/11 attacks. There is further evidence that these elements were extremely close to the Bush administration, and that the Bushes actively sought to protect the Saudis from investigation and stymie the 9/11 commission.  Below are four uncontroversial, publicly available facts. You can draw your own conclusions about whether the US government was more interested in protecting its people or protecting the Saudis.  1) The 9/11 commission Chairs believed that the commission was \"set up to fail\" due to lack of funding and other constraints. The commission was given a paltry 3 million dollars. Oh, and it was formed fourteen months after the attacks.  https://en.wikipedia.org/w…/Criticism_of_the_9/11_Commission  2) Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan (named as a suspect in the 28 pages), also known as \"Bandar Bush,\" was extremely close to both Bushes, and was known as an architect of US foreign policy in the Middle East  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan    3) At a time when all agencies were on high alert, just two days after 9/11, two planes were allowed to fly across the US picking up members of the Bin Laden family and flying them to Saudi Arabia for their safety.  4) FBI Officials were prevented from fully investigating the Saudis  https://www.theguardian.com/…/nov/07/afghanistan.september11   http://nypost.com/…/04/17/how-us-covered-up-saudi-role-in-…/  \"9/11 Commission member John Lehman was interested in the hijackers’ connections to Bandar, his wife and the Islamic affairs office at the embassy.

        "description": "Ted Simpson My buddy  Filip Morovich  challenged me to the  # 22kill  pushup challenge to bring awareness to the 22+ Veterans that commit suicide each day.  So to start, I think these sort of things are kinda dumb (well, really stupid to be honest), don't get me wrong, its truly ashamed that our veterans are not getting the care they need (and so very much deserve) to cope with the after effects of being in combat.  But to simply bring \"awareness\" to this issue, in my opinion, is kind of a cop out, anyone not living under a rock KNOWS that our Vets are getting screwed by the VA (the government), the awareness is already out there, its in your face everyday, its on the news it seems every week, if your on Facebook, you cant miss the memes, news snippets about the abysmal conditions of the VA hospitals and so on.   That all being said, I am going to \"back challenge\" every single person that reads this. Instead of doing pushups, do something tangible that will make a difference in a Vets life. You (or I) doing pushups doesn't help them cope with the PTSD, loss of limbs, TBA's, or feelings of loss and separation from their brothers and sisters that never made it home.  So, instead of doing pushups, I challenge everyone to find a local Vets organization and either volunteer some time to go help out in any way they may need, or throw some money at that organization, trust me, all the Vets organization can use more money.   I have been involved with  Veterans Sportsman Alliance / VSA  now for about 2 years, helping in anyway they need, and my own contribution has been making hunting knives for their Vets hunting and fishing trips. (visit the VSA website to learn more about what they do), as well as supplying these vets with knives and other items, I sell some of these knives with 100% of the sales going to VSA.  So there it is, put your money (or your time) where your pushups are, go do something that will benefit a Veteran, they deserve the very best. And please checkout VSA-   http://www.veteranssportsmanalliance.com/  Go buy a VSA knife (again, 100% of the sales, all $315, goes to the VSA)   https://www.darksouldesign.com/…/sharp-p…/products/vsa-knife  Or just find a local Veterans Charity to donate to or volunteer at.  P.S. DO NOT DONATE TO WOUNDED WARRIORS, they squander  the donated money on stupid shit, find a local outfit)   Brett Johnson   Alan Crouch   Aneesh Karve  #22kill    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM3J97K9UK8",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve 22 of America's veterans will commit suicide today. That's 22 too many. I'm doing 22 pushups for 22 days and nominating one new friend a day to draw attention to this issue. I usually disdain these kinds of memes but this is an opportunity to reach out to people whom I love (and often disagree with on Faceook  :)  and draw attention to a cancer that's consuming our country.  The most important thing we can do for our soldiers is to end America's interventionist foreign policy, one which interferes in the destiny of free nations, costs taxpayers trillions of dollars, extinguishes hundreds of thousands of lives, and leaves our veterans in the cold. The root cause of terrorism is what the CIA calls \"blowback,\" global disdain and revenge for America's foreign interventions. America's foreign policy of assassinations and nation building is literally manufacturing more terrorists. The war on terror in turn erodes our liberties as people surrender their rights in the name of safety.   America is deep in the grip of the military industrial complex. I believe that this is the problem of our time. To be very frank, the leading candidates from both mainstream parties are war candidates. Secretary Clinton has been extremely hawkish (Iraq, Libya, Syria) and we can expect more of the same from a Clinton presidency. Trump is an unknown. I warmly encourage all of you to look at the Libertarian ticket (socially liberal, fiscally conservative, and non-interventionist), Johnson/Weld. They're on the ballot in all 50 states and polling well. Ending the two-party stranglehold on this country is, in my humble opinion, the single most important thing we can do to end war. (Notice how 8 years of the Obama presidency have come and gone and Iraq, Afghanistan, and now Syria and Libya, are still ablaze.)  https://twitter.com/GovGaryJohnson/status/748320273754165249    Whether you agree with my politics or not, I hope that you will consider the onerous impact that war has on our society and on the world.  If I nominate you and you choose to accept, but are not inclined towards push-ups, do 22 of anything!

        "description": "Aneesh Karve Imagine being able to vote your conscience every time with no danger of electing <Candidate You Hate>? It is possible. And it is the single most important thing we can do to reinvigorate our democracy. It's called Instant Runoff Voting (IRV):  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting  I hope to see the two-party stranglehold shattered forever in my lifetime. The painful truth is that the Republican and Democratic platforms are not different in meaningful ways. No matter which Republocrat or Demican is elected, the wars will continue, the debts will pile up, and civil liberties will erode in the name of safety.  Republicans and Democrats merely appear different--because the media place them side by side and then lionize emotionally charged differences that the government has no business in in the first place (marriage, who uses which bathroom, who bakes whom a cake)... while the nation building, invasions, assassinations,  and psychological operations go on unhindered.  I want to do more to promote IRV at the federal and local level. Who's willing to help? This is one of the most powerful, politically neutral advances we can contribute to our democracy.   http://fivethirtyeight.com/…/a-spot-of-good-news-for-gary…/… Aneesh",

Regardless of your political preference, you would not support government corruption and it couldn't be more obvious. This movie would not be distributed by any major media company because they support Hillary Clinton and want to control the election outcome.      This movie has an agenda but it's based purely on a just-the-facts presentation of historical events. The movie itself contains no emotional manipulation, no spin and packs more facts and figures into its 65-minute running time than most similar films running twice as long.    ",

There is no way any human being of conscience can vote for Clinton. She has voted for and overseen one of the bloodiest periods in American foreign policy. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been lost, the Middle East has been destabilized, billions of tax dollars have been wasted, and unscrupulous rebels have been armed to overthrow sovereign governments. As Secretary of State, Clinton is directly responsible. To vote for her and pat yourself on the back is to condone American exceptionalism and to condone murder.  We are a nation of fools if we think one man's misogyny erases his opponent's war crimes. It is the oldest marketing trick in the book: A sucks, so you definitely have to buy B.  You want to be a nation of principle? Think harder. Find all of your conscience. Not just the pieces you feel like finding. We're better than this.",

The pressure from the national-security establishment grew so large that the president’s brother even expressed concerns over the possibility that the national-security establishment would remove Kennedy from power and take control of the federal government. Kennedy resisted the pressure and said no. Unfortunately, faced with a similar situation, President Trump has buckled to the national-security establishment.",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve  updated his status. The real problem is that it matters who wins this election. That is the surest sign that the people have lost their power.  You need a specific person to be in a specific chair or else all is lost? No. All is lost when we believe that the State can solve problems and has some wealth of its own with which to do so. Government has no money of its own, no power of its own. Yet I see people on both sides of the aisle begging for serfdom: \"Please take my money and spend it for me. And please force others to do likewise. Moreover force others to behave as pleases me. Only you can do this, Great State.\"  Every era has its false idols. Ours generation's false idol is the State. As people awoke from the prejudice and superstition of the middle ages, so we will awaken to our own power. You want control over your own life? Take it. Whatever we ask the government to do for us is power that we lose, and rarely ever get back.  If you really believe in socialized medicine, free education, or any other entitlement, would you support these causes with your own earnings if suddenly given a ~33% raise (a full refund of all income tax and social security)? Think deeply on this. If we really believe in these causes, shouldn't we all just keep our money and fund accordingly? But it's become so deceptively easy to spend other people's money, to raise debt against money we haven't even earned yet, and to force others to give up their earnings under the threat of imprisonment.  It's a deep mess. Time to take the power back. Aneesh Mark Vitrone",

When conservatives see United States citizens stand up and start protesting because government tyranny is infringing on their community's liberties, they are pretty sure those (usually minority) citizens should just thank the police for their service and go the hell home if they don't want marshal law imposed.

Actually, we never entered the truth era in the first place, because we as human beings reject facts that we do not like.  This is why positions of principle are essential. Principles are the only guiding light in a bewildering and factitious sea. Why do you believe what you believe? What does your candidate believe about the world, about the economy, and why is it true? What prior philosophy does s/he draw upon?

        "description": "Wild Feminine The blessing of Trump, if there can be one, is that he is shining the brightest light on the toxic effects of patriarchal (rather than matriarchal) patterns: dominance, disrespect, abuse, taking of power, power over, threats, denigration of the feminine and the female body, insecurity cloaked in ultimate authority (otherwise known as authoritarianism), and actions based in fear and hate rather than love. As a healer working closely to restore the feminine in the heart of women’s bodies for the past 20 years, I know this energy well. Every woman does too in her core because this toxic patriarchal essence has taken something, and often many things, from us collectively and personally. But know this: I have also seen time again that the feminine can not be destroyed. As the giver of life, the holder of life, the essence of life––the feminine always rises and becomes stronger. This is what we are seeing now, the clarification and cleansing process involved in this rise of the feminine. Thanks to Hilary running for President as the first women, and Trump embodying the worst of the broken masculine, it can no longer be hidden or denied how toxic the old patriarchal patterns are. Mostly, they exist subtly in layers beneath our structures, beliefs, and actions. But with this election, whether subtle or profound we all must see the hidden layers and bring them to light for healing. Take heart that this is part of the clearing and the feminine is returning. We must feel the pain to heal the pain, and so here we are in the midst of our collective witnessing––and healing.  # imwithher Bridget Regan Kristi Norman Kristina Marie Andrea Grace Antonia Louise Baur Andrea Drea Helgager Rachael Henley",

        "description": "Wild Feminine This is quite the eclipse season as we are witnessing on the global stage as well as within. Energy medicine for receiving the energy potential of this time: Let the past woundings go (as in release the imprints from your body field) and let love in. This means, if you are telling old stories about your hurts, stop yourself and set the burden down. It doesn't mean these things didn't happen, just don't keep carrying the energy with you. Consciously set it down whether it is a ...  past situation or a conflict with a person or a feeling of being hurt. Pause and imagine you are literally setting the energy of this \"old\" onto the earth for release. Then as you feel your energy field relax, ask for the energy healing needed to restore wholeness. And wholeness means that you know you are sacred, loved and worthy of love. Sacred is where you let in the flow of the divine that will guide, protect, and assist your healing. We have this flow automatically when we are born, but then it often becomes frayed as we live and have experiences of wounding. Let the divine light back in right at the place of wounding to recover wholeness. And in the divine light is the knowledge that we are loved (as in precious creations) every single one of us! There is no scarcity or proving necessary--we do not need to be or do something to receive this love. It's our birth right. And so accepting (not thinking but allowing) love in happens when we feel worthy. Bypass the mental restrictions on this and let in the love, where ever you are, right now, in the place that hurts most, to receive the blessing of this time and your own perfect beauty.   See More Tami John Williford",

Start with 'Economics in One Lesson.' Then try Keynes. Then Hayek. Then Marx. Then Hegel. Develop a worldview that you can articulate as well as defend. Test your theory with people who disagree with you. Debate. Argue. Adjust your philosophy as necessary. Then, when the next election comes around, cast a vote for the candidate whose worldview seems most in line with your own.”  I'm a fan of Hazzlit's definition of economics as the study of hidden consequences. I will finish Economics in One Lesson this weekend.   http://qpolitical.com/24-hours-after-last-nights-debate-mi…/  via  Cynthia Jolicoeur",

This figure more than doubles the arms sales of Bush's State department. No additional conflict of interest is needed to demonstrate that this is flawed foreign policy.  \"Between October 2010 and September 2012, State approved $165 billion in commercial arms sales to 20 nations that had donated to the foundation, plus another $151 billion worth of Pentagon-brokered arms deals to 16 of those countries—a 143 percent increase over the same time frame under the Bush Administration. The sales boosted the military power of authoritarian regimes such as Qatar, Algeria, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman, which, like Saudi Arabia, had been criticized by the department for human rights abuses.\"  ",

Hear it from a female Democrat.  As in Iraq and Libya, the rallying cry of alleviating suffering is having the opposite effect. The war in Syria was never authorized by Congress and has already cost more than 400,000 lives and billions of your tax dollars.  Regime change and arming foreign rebels are untenable foreign policies that destabilize the entire planet and fuel terrorism.",

Whether serving in combat or training here at home, our women and men in uniform assume risks and sacrifice each and every day. They have our eternal gratitude.

He was telling me earlier today about how when he first went to Washington, he was shocked by how badly people treated each other, and he promised himself that he would never talk badly about anyone, even those he disagreed with, and that he would treat everyone with aloha, respect.  He continues to keep this promise to this day. He told me how important it is that we all do the same, with deepening divisions within our country, with some choosing to fight hate with hate, rather than defeating hatred and bigotry with love and aloha. Let us be inspired by his important message and lifelong example of truly living aloha and sharing that aloha with all.  # LiveAloha",

You're obviously quite opposed to hillarys foreign policy. What specifically bothers you about it? Would you prefer trumps? Why or why not?  How do you feel about the environmental policies trump appears poised to enact? Specifically naming a climate science denier to the head of the EPA?",

Oppose or support his policies, but do it with the kind of intelligence, energy, and communication that leaves the country better.  As a rule, the left and the right agree on ends (freedom, prosperity, and peace) but disagree on means. No matter your stance on Trump's personal immorality, it is nothing less than prejudice to paint all of his voters as racist, misogynist, and ignorant.  Such prejudice will prove self-fulfilling. If you keep repeating that the entire system is rotten, instead of replacing the rotten beams with your own effort, you are encouraging destructive behavior. If Trump had lost, no one on the left would have tolerated that kind of behavior from his followers.",

They repented of their bias for about 5 minutes, but are now back at the altar.  The only source of truth is to think for yourself from primary sources. I add, for those who are spiritual, prayer. Because reason can only master fear to a limited degree.  If one's conclusion is that the other half of the country is stupid, that conclusion is almost certainly wrong. As a libertarian who opposes both major parties for their wrongs and inhabits a liberal coastal bubble, I'm pretty disappointed in both sides' abilities to think clearly and accurately. If you are going to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater, please be certain that there's a fire, that you know where it is, and that you have a plan to calmly usher people to the exits. Failing those conditions you will incite a stampede more dangerous than fire.  The solution is simple, but not easy: inviolable individual rights. The rights and powers of the government are in diametric opposition to the rights of the individual. Thank God we have a Bill of Rights--the entire Constitution, really. It was written to keep tyrants in check and out of power. It's full of safeguards. Truthfully, though, the Constitution is overgrown with the weeds of cancerously complex laws and an entitled populace who outsourced its liberty to the greatest oppressor in history: government itself.

        "description": "Aneesh Karve We get what we focus on. Now that Trump is telling bigots to cut it out, we should amplify that message.  I get why some people are posting post-election hate crimes: to draw attention to ugly behavior so that we can stop it. Not only are some of these hate crimes fabricated [1] but they spread fear and anger--and they make a small minority of ignorant people look a lot more important than they are. So it's about balancing positive observations with negative ones. Our minds, and the media, have an \"episodic bias\" that loves to dote on train wrecks. This warps the world to appear a lot scarier than, statistically, it actually is.  [1]  http://reason.com/…/2016/11/11/election-night-hijab-attack-…    The actual 60 minutes footage is more compelling, but here's a sampling:  President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday he was aware of reports that some of his supporters may be harassing Latinos, Muslims and members of other minority groups — a development he said must stop immediately.  In an extensive interview broadcast on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said that such behavior represented only \"a very small amount\" of his support but that any was unacceptable.  \"Don't do it,\" the president-elect said. \"That's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together.\"  To reinforce the point, Trump looked directly at the camera and demanded: \"Stop it.\"  For Americans who have loudly expressed fear about his impending presidency, Trump was reassuring, saying: \"I would tell them, 'Don't be afraid, absolutely. ... Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don't be afraid.'\"   http://www.cbsnews.com/…/reports-of-some-supporters-violen…/ Romney Baldwin Lauren Garcia Romney Baldwin Lauren Garcia Aneesh Karve",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve  updated his status. Should we support the free speech of a political party whose goal is to suppress free speech?  Many of the most divisive political questions of our time are actually logical paradoxes that can either never be resolved, or require citizens to grasp formal logic.  Abortion is another example. Most everyone supports the right of human beings to be secure from harm and to determine what they do with their own bodies. But what happens when a body happens to be inside of another body? Enter paradox.  We can actually explain racism, prejudice, and many seemingly endless political debates with formal logic and a bit of evolution.  \"Affirming the consequent\" happens when we get an implication backwards. For instance, rain implies clouds (denoted Rain => Clouds). When there is rain, there must be clouds. But clouds do not necessarily imply rain. Just because it's cloudy, does not mean that it's raining. So when we have an implication of the form P => Q, affirming the consequent is concluding from P => Q that Q => P, which might be false.  Now suppose that one Purple person committed a crime (denoted Purple person => Crime). From this observation some people will hastily and falsely conclude that Crime => Purple: all crimes are committed by Purple people. That is the definition of prejudice. In prejudice we reason from specific instances to generalizations about classes that the instance happened to belong to. Do people generalize in this way because they are rotten? No. They do it as an evolutionarily entrenched survival mechanism. After all, in the state of nature, how many times do you need to be mauled by a tiger to act as if all tigers are dangerous? Organisms that did not err on the side of caution went extinct.  It is also the case that, due externalities, we can make aggregate statements about classes of people that are true: 59% of Purple people are likely to sneeze directly on you. Now, that does not mean that all Purple people will sneeze on you. But it does mean that if you meet a Purple person on the street, he or she is a priori more likely to sneeze on you than, say, a Green person. Here--as in pretty much any decision that we make based on gender, religion, race, or political preference--anyone acting on statistics, or anyone falsely extrapolating from instances, may very well appear to be prejudiced.  We also know from statistics that, no matter how many observations we have recorded, the future may bring an observation that violates all of our previous observations, a \"black swan\" that shatters our previous models of the world. That fact inspires openness. And is an endorsement of diverse experiences as a means to build more accurate models of the world. We should never, therefore, presume that we know something about someone's abilities or someone's nature based on the classes that he or she belongs to. At the same time, our survival mechanisms, and even our rational minds, will rightfully encourage caution based on past experiences and a priori probabilities.  As citizens of the world, we face the above types of paradoxes and inferences every day. How can we use logic, statistics, and an understanding of our survival mechanisms to make the world work better for all types of people? Stephen Kizlik",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve Stay with me, friends. I believe in an America that works for people of every race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. I did not vote for Donald Trump and I did not vote for Hillary Clinton. You're safe with me. Now let's go after some things that are not working in our political discourse.  The media are taking the world for a ride with race-baiting and gender-baiting. They will shamelessly attribute every discriminatory thing that happens for the next four years to Trump. Because it riles their viewership and nets them traffic.  Ignorance existed before Trump and will exist after. We are much better off with discrimination out in the open, because we can combat it in the open. Trump doesn't make people prejudiced. They did that to themselves. Trump's unfiltered style does encourage people to say things that they were once too shy to admit--and that is the only way we'll know who needs help. Welcome to the First Amendment. We're going to hear some extraordinarily hateful things in the coming months. Just remember, \"sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"  It is incumbent upon the President to denounce discrimination and create an America that works for human beings of every religion, gender, race, etc. And I find Trump's comments on women repulsive. He would be wise to message unity in the coming months.  That said, there are a few subtleties and logical fallacies that keep tripping people up in the newly ignited discussion on equality:  1) Guilt by association (and affirming the consequent) - \"This guy is a Trump supporter. This guy is a racist. Trump is a racist.\"  2) Imputation - \"Ten racist things happened after Trump was elected. Trump caused ten racist things.\"  3) Confirmation bias - \"These 'Trump supporters' did horrible things. But I'll conveniently ignore the numerous instances of Trump supporters being beaten, harassed, and threatened for their political preference.\"  4) Clinton's murderous foreign policy in the Middle East - If ever there was an evil act of discrimination, it is represented by Clinton's foreign policy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. It remains impossible for her to claim any moral high ground in human rights. Unless you believe that Americans are the only humans. So Clinton supporters can promptly jump off of their moral high horse. I will add that her campaign took millions in donations from countries with atrocious human rights records, especially in their treatment of women.  5) Islam - There is a very nuanced discussion to be had here. And most people will be triggered before the discussion even starts. The fact is that some factions of Islam and some countries in the Middle East support policies that are contrary to America's ideals of equality. In support of women's rights, gay rights, and a civil justice system, it is constructive and truthful to attack the ideals of \"radical Islam.\" This does not mean abridging freedom of religion. It does mean that calling out hateful ideologies, without being shouted down by \"Islamophobia\", is something we should expect to hear and have the courage to do.  6) Immigration - Opposing illegal immigration is not the same as being anti-immigrant. I am the son of immigrants to this country. I support the rule of law and I support immigration, legal immigration. Nothing is more important to order than the rule of law, and nothing is more important to the rule of law than consistency. It is a threat to the rule of law to \"be nice\" to some people just because we feel like it. If anyone doubts this, try \"just showing up\" in Canada and see what happens.  7) Race and the election - if you really want to be open-minded, listen to the Black, Muslim, and Female Trump supporters (like this  https://twitter.com/StacyOnTheRig…/status/796364933344743425 ). They have excellent and rational points. But the Left repeatedly shamed such viewpoints into silence. To the best of my knowledge, Trump gained in his Black and Latino share of the vote over Mitt Romney. Moreover, the same people who elected Barack Obama simply didn't show up to vote for Clinton. So every time that someone says \"racism elected Trump\" it not only ignores the facts, but shames everyone that voted for him into silence.

        "description": "Aneesh Karve Fantastic article on political bias in science. It's common to call Republicans anti-science, but the situation is more complex, with the Left proving just as damaging to the truth. Even in science we find the ever-present bugbear that this election is forcing us to deal with: the dissent-shaming liberal honor brigade.  From the article: \"Academics have traditionally leaned left politically, and many fields have essentially become monocultures, especially in the social sciences, where Democrats now outnumber Republicans by at least 8 to 1. (In sociology, where the ratio is 44 to 1, a student is much likelier to be taught by a Marxist than by a Republican.) The lopsided ratio has led to another well-documented phenomenon: people’s beliefs become more extreme when they’re surrounded by like-minded colleagues. They come to assume that their opinions are not only the norm but also the truth.\"   http://www.city-journal.org/html/real-war-science-14782.html  There is a certain condescension inherent in modern progressivism, which pretends that it knows how to run everyone's lives; see George Will at 6:40  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udZsVSOJSkM#t=6m40s . (This ignites a fascinating discussion on central versus planned economies, with conservatives arguing that distributed autonomous agents are more efficient allocators of scarce resources.)

The default state of humanity in nature is poverty. It's gumption that makes for abundance. (Also my biggest takeaway from Frank Herbert's Dune.)  Love, grace, and charity are of course the highest ideals. But what produces the abundance that makes them possible?",

        "description": "Oliver Stone  added  4 new photos . THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING  As 2016 draws to a close, we find ourselves a deeply unsettled nation. We’re unable to draw the lines of our national interest. Is it jobs and economy, is it national security, or is it now in our interest to ensure global security -- in other words, act as the world’s policemen?   As the “failing” (to quote Trump) New York Times degenerates into a Washington Post organization with its stagnant Cold War vision of a 1950s world where the Russians are to blame for most everything -- Hillary’s loss, most of the aggression and disorder in the world, the desire to destabilize Europe, etc. -- the Times has added the issue of ‘fake news’ to reassert its problematic role as the dominant voice for the Washington establishment. Certainly this is true in the case of Russia’s ‘hacking’ the 2016 election and putting into office its Manchurian Candidate in Donald Trump. Apparently the CIA (via various unnamed intelligence officials), and the FBI, NSA, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (who notoriously lied to Congress in the Snowden affair), President Obama, the DNC, Hillary Clinton, and Congress agree that Russia, and Mr. Putin predominantly, is responsible.    Certainly the psychotic, war-loving Senator John McCain is right up there alongside these patriots, calling President Putin a “thug, bully and a murderer and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying.” He actually said this -- the man whose sound judgment chose Sarah Palin as his VP nominee in ’08. And the Times followed by printing the story in its full glory on page one, clearly agreeing with McCain’s point of view. I don’t remember Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, or Reagan, in the darkest days of the 1950s/80s, ever singling out a Russian President like this. The invective was aimed at the Soviet regime, but never were Khrushchev or Brezhnev the target of this bile. I guess this is a new form of American diplomacy. If a black youth in our inner cities were killed or a Pakistani wedding party were murdered by our drones, would President Obama be singled out as a murderer, bully, thug? Such personalization is a sign of sickness in our thinking and way beneath what should be our standards.   Note the enclosed link (\"US Intel Vets Dispute Russia Hacking Claims\") from the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (which includes the ex-NSA reformer Bill Binney, a mathematical genius who inspired the Nic Cage character in “Snowden”). He talks here about what hacking really means, as opposed to a ‘leak’. The Times and other mainstream media have surprisingly evaded any contrary evidence, such as that presented by Craig Murray, ex-ambassador and Wikileaks spokesman who says he was given the information in a Washington park by a Democratic ‘insider’ who was disgusted by the behavior of the DNC; Murray then gave it to Wikileaks. This was a ‘leak,’ not a ‘hack,’ and always seemed to me the likely source for this scandal (as I think the Sony leak was as well, falsely blamed on North Korea, but that’s another matter). And if this were to be properly investigated, it might very well lead to the discovery that this was Hillary Clinton’s ‘Nixon moment.’ Clearly the DNC offices were up to no good. Ironically, Clinton first made her name as one of the investigators into Watergate. See Mark Ames’s article, “Site Behind McCarthyite Blacklist,” tracking this foul play to Washington Post journalist Craig Timberg.  I remember well in the 1950s when the Russians were supposed to be in our schools, Congress, State Department -- and according to many Eisenhower/Nixon supporters -- about to take over our country without serious opposition (and they call me paranoid!). It was this same media who insisted on our need to go to Vietnam to defend our freedoms against the communists 6,000 miles away. And after the Red Scare finally went away for good in 1991, let us remind ourselves that It never ended. It became Hussein of Iraq with his weapons of mass destruction, and talk of the ‘mushroom cloud.’ It became the Demon, as real as any Salem Witch Trial. It was Gaddafi of Libya, and then it was Assad of Syria. In other words, as in an Orwellian prophesy, it never ended, and I can guarantee you it never will -- unless we the people who still think for ourselves in this existential matter, can say “Enough” to this demon act. “Enough,’ “go away” -- laugh in their faces.   Of course, the NYT/WaPo nexus rarely publishes any of our serious dissents and therefore we take refuge in alternate media, such as 'The Nation,' ‘Consortiumnews,’ ‘The Intercept,’ ‘Naked Capitalism,’ ‘Counterpunch,’ ‘Zero Hedge,’ ‘ Antiwar.com ,’ ‘Truthdig,’ ‘Common Dreams,’ etc. I think then we were all quite shocked (but not surprised) when recently we saw 200 WEBSITES listed as tools of the Kremlin (WaPo’s November 24, “Russian propaganda effort helped spread ‘fake news’ during election”).   My God, the ghost of Izzy Stone is back from the 1950s! For that matter, so is Tom Clancy from the ’80s. False thrillers will now be written about the Russians hacking the American elections. Money and TV serials will be made. I’ve never read such hysterical junk in the New York Times (call it what it is -- “fake news”), in which the editorials have become outrageous diatribes of alleged crimes by Russia, many of them presumably written by Serge Schmemann, one of those ideologues who still looks for Russians under his bed at night; they were called ‘White Russians’ in the old days and, like right-wing Cubans in Miami, are unable to live down past grievances. Schmemann is obviously riding high at the NYT edit board. This type of thinking has clearly influenced the Pentagon and many of our Generals' statements, and has pervaded MSM reporting. When one group-think controls our national conversation, it becomes truly dangerous. In this spirit, I’m linking several crucial essays of new vintage, pointing out the disgrace the MSM has become.   As much as I may disagree with Donald Trump (and I do) he’s right now target number one of the MSM propaganda -- until, that is, he jumps to the anti-Kremlin track because of some kind of false intelligence or misunderstanding cooked up by CIA. Then I fear, in his hot-headed way, he starts fighting with the Russians, and it wouldn’t be long then until a state of war against Russia is declared. I have no doubt then that our over-financed military ($10 to every 1 Russian dollar) will mean NOTHING against a country that right now believes the US, with the largest buildup of NATO on its borders since Hitler’s World War II, is crazed enough to prepare for a preemptive strike. In his analysis, “The Need to Hold Saudi Arabia Accountable,” Robert Parry points out that this conflict ironically started in the 1980s with the Neoconservatives defining Iran as the number one terrorist sponsor in the world. How this leads to our present mess is a brilliant analysis that is unknown to the American public.  I urge you to read the following articles and stay calm in your thinking. But bring it to bear in some way. As a believer in what the Dalai Lama says, every single one of us, even through our prayers, can add to the betterment of this world. I never thought I’d find myself praying for the level-headedness of a Donald Trump. Remember “The Iliad”? As Homer would have it, the gods would hover over each day’s battles and decide on the outcome. Who would die and who would live. Are the gods still listening?

        "description": "Oliver Stone It’s taken me longer than I’d planned to read all 700+ comments on the June 27 post on “The Putin Interviews.” So many comments were inspiring, well thought-out and articulate -- and, in many cases, complex. The responses were a mix of nationalities and locales, and the roles in society varied. It gives me a sense of community in this world of people who think along the same lines, namely one that has a love for peace and, to a realistic degree, of justice. I appreciate this  ... dialogue.   In a follow-up vein, I’m posting my ‘Nation’ Q&A of June 12 with Ed Rampell; it’s the most comprehensive I’ve given on the “Putin Interviews” -- the whys, hows, and several of my personal conclusions. I’ve never quite seen it discussed in such detail before.  I’m also putting up my co-author on “Untold History” Peter Kuznick’s comments on the interviews. Kuznick is more of a skeptic than I am on Mr. P. Therefore, it’s interesting to read his thoughts questioning the man. I remember when Peter felt strongly that Putin was behind the Democratic hack. Now, no longer. Follow his reasoning and think about his reservations.    Finally, Jeremy Kuzmarov (Huffington Post, June 26) gives us one Russian’s take on the series.  Ed Rampell, The Nation, “Oliver Stone Talks to ‘The Nation’ About His New Documentary ‘The Putin Interviews,”  http://bit.ly/2srIZEj  Edu Montesanti/Peter Kuznick, Telesur, “Oliver Stone Praised as ‘Peacemaker’ for Talking to Putin,”  http://bit.ly/2sfmEra  Jeremy Kuzmarov, Huffington Post, “Spirit of McCarthyism Seen In Attacks on Oliver Stone’s ‘Putin Interviews,’”  http://bit.ly/2tLgj8y   See More",

On July 17 the film can be seen on additional outlets, such as iTunes, Hulu, and Amazon.  The film demonstrates that there was an illegal coup d’etat in February 2014 by Ukrainian nationalists and American supporters that did not reflect the will of the large ethnic Russian minority in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea. “Ukraine on Fire” makes a fine companion piece to “The Putin Interviews” and shouldn’t be missed.",

Too many notices, I thought, were politically motivated and/or hateful of Putin to an extreme degree, picturing him solely as a villain without a soul. It’s truly, in our time, something out of Orwell’s “Hate Week.” How does this help the world’s situation? Is it Russia that is disbalancing it or is it truly the United States? Why is it that these types of people in media power are against any kind of impr ... ovement in relations between our countries?   In any case, Showtime was very pleased with the results, and the series continues on Showtime Anytime. I’m now in France where there’s been a ton of coverage, and we’re on France 3 beginning last night. We were on Sky in England and Germany, and in September will be on RAI in Italy. More to come.

We are overwhelmingly told about voice in democracy. But let's be real, it's practically defunct. Technology that once again puts us in charge of our own money, communications, ideas, and enforcement will be the source of unimagined exits (and therefore voice) in 2017 and beyond.  Increasingly \"the cloud\" means that you're location does not determine your possibilities, your interests do.  Exit is the search for self-determination. And vast networks of information will make it possible for each us to self-determine—together.  This is the ultimate expression of technology: to provide more options to more people. And is a pale shadow of the ultimate exit that Buddha called Nirvana.  ",

It's a hope that sounds promising but ignores the first rule of economics: scarcity. And it promotes the false idea that one person has the *right* to another person's services—that is to say, slavery.  Socialism is a philosophy for politicians who are out of solutions. The only remaining option? Force others to do what the you cannot or will not do.  Taleb shows what Piketty and Krugman get wrong, and how to fix it with skin in the game. https://www.facebook.com/Sharpe4LPVP/photos/a.1576844075978622.1073741827.1576841435978886/1705835206412841/?type=3&theater",

Agents refused to show me the corresponding regulations, insisting it was a gun part since it can be used to load a magazine. I replied that the same was true for my thumb. No answer.   I should have made an emotional argument instead of a rational one. About how women have to give up their breast milk, be felt up by random strangers, etc. I will remember this for next time. I wanted, lovingly but firmly, to help them see that they were part of a slippery slope system that is gradually eroding individual rights, rather than leave them wondering why that guy was difficult  🤔  They were nice people, doing their jobs. I think tyranny creeps in with a smile and a feeling that the enforcers are just obeying the law to \"keep everyone safe.\"",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve I'm following these matches with great interest. Go is many trillions of times more complex than chess—a game of intuition and esthetics. AlphaGo is poised to topple the world number one, but the most interesting matches are teams of people against AlphaGo and AlphaGo+human teams against one another. Human+machine will be a much more interesting and important story in the next decade than human vs machine.   I am hopeful that Google will continue to open the tech and training data. The new AlphaGo is hundreds of times more efficient than its prior incarnation and can be trained in a fraction of the time. And… it trained entirely by playing itself. No human games were studied. Such rapid advances in both capability and efficiency mean we'll see startlingly intelligent special purpose machines in our lifetimes.   https://events.google.com/alphago2017/   https://www.wired.com/…/googles-alphago-levels-board-games…/",

        "description": "Aneesh Karve Liberty is autonomy. It does not give you the right to rule others.  Most modern crusades for social justice are an attempt to force others to do things that the advocates are unwilling or unable to do. Career politicians--instead of inventing, earning, or donating--spend their entire lives *talking* about how they might rob Peter to pay Paul.  A negative right is something that cannot justly be taken from you: life, property, privacy. A positive right is something that others owe you, and is usually an illusion. Asserting a positive right to healthcare, for instance, means that you have the right to conscript doctors and nurses, and force them to serve you. This is false. The state of humanity in nature is one of poverty and scarcity. Asserting positive rights does nothing to remedy this condition.  If we are to become a society of principle, we must start with the most basic and holy principle: non-aggression. To respect freedom of choice--so long as it does not harm others--is to respect the most divine essence of humanity: volition.  The moral obligation to help other human beings can only flourish when individuals are free to choose whom to help and when. The changes we want to see in the world will not be brought about through laws. \"Law\" is a euphemism for \"force.\" Those who do not comply with the law face the barrel of a gun and imprisonment. Law is therefore only useful to enforce the most basic negative rights. As for positive rights, they express a deep-seated political desire to control others. This desire would be better channeled through culture.  Culture and technology--not law and politics--are the instruments of change that we seek. Culture and technology SHOW the way. Law TELLS of a way that some people think might work. As for Liberty, it is simply not possible to be free in a world where the laws are so numerous and complex that the common man does not have time to read them, let alone digest and reconcile them.  Autonomy, then, is the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. The authors pledged their Lives,  Fortunes, and sacred Honor to it. https://www.facebook.com/GKKasparov/posts/10154026469573307 Aneesh Karve",

Socialism sounds great in speech soundbites and on Facebook, but please keep it there. In practice, it corrodes not only the economy but the human spirit itself, and the ambition and achievement that made modern capitalism possible and brought billions of people out of poverty. Talking about Socialism is a huge luxury, a luxury that was paid for by the successes of capitalism. Income inequality is a huge problem, absolutely. But the idea that the solution is more government, more regulation, more debt, and less risk is dangerously absurd. Garry Kasparov",

        "description": "Garry Kasparov A brief interview after my appearance back at the board in Saint Louis for the Times of India, with a few questions about my old rival Anand, of course. Despite my place in the standings, I consider it a great success! An excerpt:  • How has the comeback experience been?  From a chess perspective and a sporting perspective, very difficult. I knew it would be hard, but it's still painful to miss so many opportunities. The chess goddess Caissa is a jealous goddess, and she punish ... ed me for abandoning her for 12 years! But overall, my goal of promoting chess and drawing attention to the Grand Chess Tour and what is happening in St Louis was a success.  • What made you come back for this?  This is the key question, because it was never about \"Garry Kasparov wants to play chess again\" or me having a good result. I'm an ambassador for chess, and I've dedicated much of my life to advocating for the game and its benefits. Playing in St Louis was a great way to do that. The Grand Chess Tour and the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St Louis deserve full support and my participation at the board was a means to that end. Rex Sinquefield [an American businessman based in Missouri] and his family have been incredible supporters of chess for years, how could I do less?  • How long can Anand play and is there a chance for him to regain the world title?  Obviously his odds get worse with every passing year, but he was an underdog to qualify already in 2014, when he won the Candidates, and he was only a point behind Karjakin just last year, so it would be a mistake to underestimate his experience even if he isn't the favorite.  He can and should play as long as he likes, no more and no less. Sportsmen, even world champions, don't owe anyone their unhappiness. As I said, we aren't statues, we are human beings. He should do what makes him happy.   See More Garry Kasparov",

        "description": "Garry Kasparov Ever since I retired from professional chess in 2005, I've dedicated much of my life to sharing the joys and benefits of chess around the world, especially in education. This week, I'm honored to have the chance be able to promote my beloved game in the most enjoyable way I know, at the chessboard! I'm delighted that my brief appearance back in front the pieces has drawn extra attention to the Saint Louis Rapid and Blitz event, to the Grand Chess Tour, and to the tremendous s ... ponsorship and promotion of chess by the Sinquefield family.  I'd like to quickly manage expectations about my participation and my future chess activities. I would also like to make sure the other participants, among the very best chess players in the world, receive their due. My opponents include: Hikaru Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana, Levon Aronian, Sergey Karjakin, Ian Nepomniachtchi, David Navara, Le Quang Liem, and Lenier Dominguez. I have never faced any of them in an official competition before. That's certainly not the case with the last competitor, a fellow veteran from \"the good old days,\" Vishy Anand, who just showed fantastic form in the classical Sinquefield Cup event. I am always optimistic, but at the age of 54 I would have as much hope of returning to my chess form of age 40 as to my hairline of age 20!  I have no plans to play after this event. Saint Louis is a special place for me, and I'm glad to take advantage of this unique opportunity accorded me by the organizers and my friend Rex Sinquefield. But this is not an end to my retirement from chess, only a five-day hiatus. Human rights activism, writing, lecturing, promoting chess via my foundation, and especially spending time with my family—these things are my life today, and I will not risk ruining a winning position! As far as being a professional goes, any earnings I receive from this event will be donated toward promoting chess in Africa, which has become a particular passion for my wife and me in recent years.  My thanks for all the kind wishes that have come in from around the world. I will do my best not to disappoint you—or myself!
