That's the aim! Only I didn't keep insisting Santa was real once they worked it out, unlike many of the other lies they will be told through their life. Why would you teach your kids that what their parents - or anyone else in authority, for that matter - should not be considered in the light of evidence?",

Over fifty applications were received for the position and the standard was very high.  At the conclusion of interviews, two outstanding candidates were invited to do a presentation last night to the entire Management Committee, whose members were then vested with the responsibility to choose the new CE.  We are pleased to announce the Management Committee has appointed Dr Timothy Adams as CE.  Tim will join the organisation in February. Tim is a Veterinarian and has additional tertiary qualifications as an MBA. He brings to Dogs Victoria extensive advocacy experience at all levels of Government and with animal organisations, has strategic media and communications experience and proven financial and business acumen derived from working with previous businesses and groups in the Animal industry.  Management Committee wishes to acknowledge the selfless dedication and service Wayne Fleming has made to Dogs Victoria, initially as President then as Acting CE. Wayne stepped up to lead the organisation during a period of adversity and uncertainty and we owe a great debt of gratitude to him.  In the coming months Tim Adams will be making himself known to the membership and we welcome him to Dogs Victoria.     Regards  Darren Bowey  Acting President  Dogs Victoria",

Currently, these tuition waivers are paid by the college directly to itself, on behalf of the graduate student, and are not counted as taxable income. Under the new GOP tax plan, however, those tuition waivers would be taxed as regular income, making graduate school an unaffordable proposition except for those already independently wealthy.\"  Grad students would be taxed as though they make about $80k/year. Good luck with that.",

You don't need to justify your response to a private survey. But if you are, it would be okay with me if you defriend me. Really. I just don't think we have the same vision for the future and the future our children will inherit. In which case, you won't really miss my random posts. And as an added bonus, I won't need to call you out on your exclusivity. Thanks  üòÄ",
