Olya kept asking me if I knew you and I wasn't sure, but anyway I just wanted to say hi because I guess we are like distant relatives and live in the same city.  Yay.  I go to NAU, for spanish education.  I work at San Felipes downtown.  It be cool to grab a coffee or something sometime.  Here is my contact info.  \n\nJulia Eve\n928-380-7730\n\n"
