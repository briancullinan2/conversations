It will include admission to the event, a guaranteed seat, a guaranteed table, elbow room, viewing of the fight (with sound), a server to serve you, feed you, clean up after you and it will include $100 in food, beer, liquor or wine. Therefore, your first $100 in food & beverages will have already been paid for. Your seat will be saved for anytime that you may leave it such as going to the Restroom or patio.  We will also have some other events going on during the evening, a DJ to follow the fight, and we will be giving away some prizes before the fight starts.  As you walk through the door you will get a BUD LIGHT UFC Mardi Gras bead (1st come, 1st served) with a UFC octagon on it.  That octagon will have a number and we will draw numbers for prizes.   We will also have \"port-a-johns\" rented to help limit lines to the restroom.    Tables are to be prepaid for via credit card or cash.  An early cancellation fee of $50 will take place up to Aug 23rd and a $100 cancellation fee will take place thereafter.   We can and will also accommodate 2 tops and 6 tops.  Those are limited so let me know if you fall in that category.   My advice is not to chance going to watch the fight somewhere as a \"walk-in\" and planning on getting food or good service.  Plan it right, book table with us that night.",

I know there is nothing more tedious than doing this but it's for a good reason. As I said a few weeks ago, my brother Santino has been working on a Documentary film called \"From the Ground Up\" for the last three years and it would mean a lot if all of you could help spread some awareness.
