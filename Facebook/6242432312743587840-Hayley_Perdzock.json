I was hoping to reach you because I specialize within Infrastructure and Security specific opportunities with TEKsystems. I am not sure if you are open to new opportunities at the moment, but I was hoping to speak with you about a position we have available for an Application Security Architect. Our client is based out of Memphis, TN; however, this resource can sit remotely from Phoenix.\n\nLet me know if this is something you're interested in and if there is a time we can connect to discuss in further detail. If anything, maybe you know someone who might be interested. \n\nThanks, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon! \n\nHayley\n\nHayley Perdzock\n901.415.1005 | hperdzoc@teksystems.com\n"
