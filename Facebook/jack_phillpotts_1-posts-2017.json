I also hate the people that claim they have depression for attention, this is only a small percentage compared to people that are actually depressed, however these people who just throw the term depression around to pass off their shitty mood on that particular day actually negate the experiences and reception of people with actual depression.  If you're depressed you'd spend less time telling others to get pity and you'd spend more time y'know actually being depressed.  This isn't directed at anyone If you believe that you or someone you know may be depressed or have another mental condition/disorder then please I encourage to go to a doctor for your good, mental health is important and I you're someone that isn't‚Äã diagnosed with any condition please don't throw the names around as it can affect anyone actually struggling with these issues.",

        "description": "Jack Phillpotts The general election here in the UK is equally as bad for us as the US election, on the one hand you have Theresa May, A wannabe emperor Palpatine, looking to make Britain some drab concrete slab of an island with coal powered factories as working class are forced into just doin the most menial of trash. Then on the other hand you have Jeremy Corbyn a leader with less enthusiasm than a disposable lighter, who wants to re nationalise the railways of Britain buy buying them back from the private company's yet still paying for the NHS with this money that we apparently have plenty of.  It's a goddamn bad situation in Britain when you want ukip and the lib Dems to have a coalition!  Hereby I am announcing that upon becoming 18, two years from now I will create my own political party, of reason and progress, the social views o the lib Dems, the economic views of the conservatives, the environmental views of the green party and the conflict and warfare views of Labour.  This may sound like a joke however my inspiration here is the current political cesspool which is messing everything up.  Vote for me in the future and I'll sort shit out.",

        "description": "Michael Keeble Abbott has let it slip that May and her self will be meeting with the Queen on 56/14/17. They are proposing the Queen allow them to form a Government based on some buzz words.   \"strong and stable \" and now the new one \"confidence and supply deal\" The Queen is expected to send May to the tower and Abbott back to infant School and learn Maths again. Boris has refused to be the next Tory leader as him and Trump are meeting up for a DNA test to see if they both come  from the same wig. UKIP has a new leader and is expecting to  have a new leader each week. Tin Farron the Lib Dem leader has stepped down to play the voice of Tinky-Winky in the new Teletubbies show. Rumours were flying around the house of commons that Cameron might step up for the new Tory leader. When asked Cameron replied. Oh gosh NO. iv had my time dealing with the peasants of the UK leave it to someone else to deal with the scum. Nick Clegg when asked if he would take over from Farron looked up at the selling for 2 minutes 27 seconds with a glazed look in his eyes and then said \" I have new shoes \" Abbot has stood up against the press saying she cant count and has called a meeting this month on the 34th. When asked did she pass Maths at School she said. I like apples and I also have new shoes.",
