        "description": "Jon Brickman  is  feeling emotional at  ·ûú·û∂·ûõ·ûñ·û∑·ûÉ·û∂·ûä·ûá·ûæ·ûÑ·ûØ·ûÄ Killing Field . I had the chance yesterday on my adventure to go to the S21 Prison and Genocide Museum here in Phnom Penh and after seeing that went to what is now the infamous Killing Fields during the 1975-1979 Cambodian Genocide as lead by it's notorious revolutionary leader Pol Pot. It was eye opening, shocking, and emotional the things that I saw and learned about how at least 2 million people including some foreigners even along with Cambodians were taken to the Killing Fields on the outskirts of Phnom Penh and brutally killed. You'd think after Hitler's reign ended in WW2 something like this and another radicalist leader wouldn't come into such power but it did happen and this time against it's own people in Cambodia.  The bones I saw still sticking out of the ground were shocking in the mass graves and this is important history everyone should know. It was relatively recent only just over 35 years ago. Since I had family killed during the holocaust seeing something like this hits  close to home. I'm happy I paid my respects and I got the exact same chills at the Killing Fields as I did when I visited Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps in Poland 4 years ago. Never forget and learn about these events so history does not continue to repeat itself. Here is video of the memorial stupa now in the center of the Killing Fields surrounded by the mass graves and the killing tree they used to murder children against specifically. It's full of the bones and skulls found of some of the 2 million people killed here.",

        "description": "Jon Brickman  added  2 new photos  ‚Äî at  Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum . I had the chance to meet these two remarkable people Bou Meng and Chum Mey. They are only two of only 12 survivors out of over 2 million people mostly Cambodians that were murdered during the Cambodian Genocide in the late 1970s as orchestrated by revolutionary leader Pol Pot that were killed at the killing fields. Chum mey survived by chance since a guard discovered he could fix the typewriters that the Khmer Rouge used to keep intricate records of those they murdered. He was a mechanic by trade and became useful to them. I met them both at the S21 Prison which is in the middle of Phnom Penh. It was actually a high school which was transformed by the Khmer Rouge into a prison and place where they would torture Cambodians to make confessions for things they never had done by waterboarding and numerous other methods of medieval torture. They both wrote books on what they went through to which I bought both of them. It's amazing to me that they survived and have forgiven enough to mentally even be able to step back into the walls where they saw so much bloodshed. Both of their entire families were murdered. Pol pot was actually never punished for his crimes against humanity and lived under house arrest and a normal life until he died of natural causes and age at 73. Crazy to me that someone who was the equivalent of Hitler was able to live a long normal life after murdering so many people including thousands and thousands of children in the most savage of ways. It was an honor and a privilege to meet these two men who are the epitome of what it means to be a survivor on things to which were so horrifying beyond your control.",

My 50th country I have adventured through in Cambodia. i made it to another of the 7 wonders of the world Angkor Wat and wait until you see the photos! Cambodia you have been different from the rest and more of a challenge to travel through and yet have been equally magical and beautiful I have loved it all. I have made some great friends here I am looking forward to keeping in touch with shout out to Taj and Navin!  üòÄ üòÄ  Had legit an absolute best final night in Cambodia thanks to them! Now it's back to Singapore with a stopover in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia  for one final night to reflect on the past 3 weeks before I begin the long journey home to the USA tomorrow.  # YOLOSOLO   # journeyon   # ADVENTURER   # worldtraveler",

This was my final night in Singapore back to where my life changing YOLO SOLO southeast Asian adventure began 3 weeks ago. 5 countries and 6 cities later here i am back to the start! I didnt think id feel so emotional but this was a special epic adventure unlike any of the others ive done because it was completely by myself. I had some anxiety from the start but it quickly dissipated once i got here. I came back here to reflect and literally spent the whole time thinking about how much I've learned about myself and and the bucket list dreams that have come true and the amazing people I have been lucky to meet along the way! This had been an adventure for the record books I have had so much more life experience from this one and I am coming home I feel a bit different and changed and a better person because of my time over the last 3 weeks. #yolosolo #jbslife #journeyon #southeastasia",

They had these amazing bars literally in the backs of these guys motorbikes on the street and the drinks were strong and only $1.50!!! You could also dine on tarantula and scorpions and snakes and other bugs on the cart next door after you've had a few! I partied with these guys from Germany and this gal from Holland and one from Greece and became her gay wingman because every guy wanted her and I fended them off haha! In turn she fed me some sort of whatever bucket of alky she Had! Also this little cambodian boy pulled my chest out of my tank and jiggled my moobs nonstop and started punching my chest in an apparent test of strength and i loved every second of it hahaha! Omg this was truly such a fun place! Just dancing literally in the streets having drinks meeting cool and fun people from around the world. I absolutely loved this night!  # cambodianightlife",

This may be a hard video for some to watch but I feel this is an important piece of History in the world that not enough people know about and the more that are educated I think the better of what happened in Cambodia that coincided with the Vietnam War. The Khmer Rouge led by revolutionary leader Pol Pot orchestrated a genocide of the Cambodian People and killed Men, Women, and Children. The Khmer Rouge regime arrested and eventually executed almost everyone suspected of connections with the former government or with foreign governments, as well as professionals and intellectuals. Ethnic Vietnamese, ethnic Thai, ethnic Chinese, ethnic Cham, Cambodian Christians, and the Buddhist monkhood were the demographic targets of persecution. This took place from 1975-1979 and at that time the population was 8 million and the Khmer Rouge killed 2.5 million out of that 8 million population. He killed them where I took this video in what was dubbed the killing fields. These are the skulls of some of the bodies discovered in the mass graves at this site and they are put inside this memorial stupa to never forget and pay respect to those that lost their lives. The skulls and other bones are marked as to the methods to which they were killed by Ax, gunshot, etc etc. some methods they used were so brutal. Since guns and ammunition were expensive they used various sharp and blunt objects mostly to kill people. They even played music on speakers hung off of trees to drown out the sounds and moans of people being murdered. They say there is not one person alive today whose family wasnt affected by these mass killings. Its important to learn about these morbid pieces of history so that we try to not let someone with insane ideals come to power again. It was a shocking and emotional day being in this place where such brutality take place and I highly recommend a visit if you go to Cambodia and learn about this event.",
