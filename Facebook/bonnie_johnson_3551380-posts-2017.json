The agonizing words \"I'm sorry there's nothing more we can do\" has haunted us for the past 12 hours. We have to hold on to hope and faith even when the days ahead of us are uncertain. The cancer is back and it has spread across the top right side of Robbie's brain and surgery is no longer an option. We are home prepping for war once again- we refuse to give up the fight! We insisted he come home on an NG tube to keep his nutrition up and to give meds. I don't what we are going to do next, we are consulting doctors from all over.  God is bigger than any cancer and miracles happen everyday! Please continue to pray hard for our little boy!",
