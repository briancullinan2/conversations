With due respect to the Speaker, he and I must have read different scripture. The one I read taught that we are judged not by how we treat the powerful but how we care for the least among us. There is no mercy in a system that makes health care a luxury. This bill is no act of mercy. It is an act of malice. Congressman Joe Kennedy III",

        "description": "Earl Oremus Health Care Rant:  FAKE HEALTH CARE!  FAKE HEALTH CARE!  Seven years of Republicans whining, complaining, reviling President Obama, and vilifying the Affordable Healthcare Act.  Fifty two Republican votes over those years to repeal ACA.  Seven years of promises of the wonderful new Republican system they would provide if only they had the votes. A year and a half of Trump campaigning on constant promises of a system with better coverage and lower costs.  And what do they cobble together at the last minute?  A bill that proposes to yank health care away 20 or so million people served by ACA and Medicare.  A bill that transforms one 60+ year old married couple's premiums from $750 to $17,000 per year.  A bill so stupid, stinking and dysfunctional that even the Republicans themselves couldn't hold their Pinochio noses long enough to vote for it.  Seven damn years of their screaming about how horrible ACA is.  And with all that time to propose something productive that would fix the system, they are incapable of even bringing a health care bill to a vote. And these are the people we have voted into control of the House, the Senate, the White House, the Supreme Court, our economy, our foreign relations, our environment, our efforts to curb global warming, our defense, and the core values that define our democracy  ... in short, the issues that will decide our country's future for the next generation.  These people seem heartless when dealing with the less fortunate, mindless when it comes to using evidence and rational thinking to solve problems, shameless when it comes to using their power to benefit themselves, and soul-less when advantaging their 1% campaign funders at the expense of the rest of our nation.  Sad to say, it looks like it's not just Fake Health Care folks; it looks like it may just be four years of Fake Government, too.",

I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1lb of pork, so I adjusted things as needed for the extra 1/2lb of meat. I made about 40 meatballs, and they were so good!  I really loved the gravy. That's what totally made it. All three of my boys ate all of their food, ate it FAST, and asked for seconds. I will definitely be making this again  üëç üëç ",

        "description": "Kathy Hoessly Cullinan I listened as they called my President a Muslim.  I listened as they called him and his family a pack of monkeys.  I listened as they said he wasn't born here.  I watched as they blocked every single path to progress that they could.  I saw the pictures of him as Hitler.  I watched them shut down the government and hurt the entire nation twice.  I watched them turn their backs on every opportunity to open worthwhile  dialogue.  I watched them say that they would not even listen to any choice for Supreme  Court no matter who the nominee was.  I listened as they openly said that they will oppose him at every turn.  I watched as they did just that.  I listened.  I watched.  I paid attention.  Now, I'm being called on to be tolerant.  To move forward.  To denounce protesters.  To \"Get over it.\"  To accept this...  I will not.  I will do my part to make sure this great American mistake becomes the  embarrassing footnote of our history that it deserves to be.  I will do this as quickly as possible every chance I get.  I will do my part to limit the damage that this man can do to my country.  I will watch his every move and point out every single mistake and misdeed in a loud and proud voice.  I will let you know in a loud voice every time this man backs away from a promise he made to them.  Them. The people who voted for him.  The ones who sold their souls and prayed for him to win.  I will do this so that they never forget.  And they will hear me.  They will see it in my eyes when I look at them.  They will hear it in my voice when I talk to them.  They will know that I know who they are.  They will know that I know what they are.  Do not call for my tolerance. I've tolerated all I can.  Now it's their turn to tolerate ridicule.  Be aware, make no mistake about it, every single thing that goes wrong in  our country from this day forward is now Trump's fault just as much as they thought it was Obama's.  I find it unreasonable for them to expect from me what they were entirely unwilling to give.  -Jeremy Mitchell",

A couple of months ago I posted an angry message about people who had disliked President Obama (whom I loved) and then voted for President Trump. In doing this - attacking essentially half the country - I hurt some cousins that are very dear to me. . . and likely some other friends and relatives as well.  So, while I oppose President Trump and most of what the Republicans are proposing, there will be no more hate messages here.",

        "description": "Mary Jacobs Copied from post written by Allee Michelle Monheim:   Tonight I had a conversation with a man I've known and considered a friend for most of my adult life. He told me that \"we\" should be glad that white supremacists and nazis are exposing themselves so we can see them for who they are.   Thing is, they've been exposing themselves to me for a long time.   They exposed themselves to me in junior high when my friend asked me not to tell her grandparents I was Jewish, or they wouldn't let her hang out with me.   They exposed themselves to me when I showed up to Hebrew school one day and was sent home because someone had hopped our fence and drawn swastikas on our Temple.   They did it a few years later when I was teaching at that same Hebrew school and I had to send my own students home because someone did it again.   They did it when I had to speak at a school board meeting in 2005 when I was a senior in high school because Jewish students weren't being allowed to make up tests they missed for the High Holidays.   And again, when the principal of my high school said the High Holidays weren't important, in front of a room full of students after my friend, another Jewish student, asked why we didn't get those days off like other schools in Southern California (yes, this all took place in Southern California. In LA County, no less).  And again, in October of last year, when I went to a show at a bar and a holocaust denier followed me around all night after I told him that he needed to stop talking to me because I was Jewish and didn't want to hear it.   And I've had it easy compared to most - I'm still a white girl who lives in a blue state. There's so much I don't have to deal with, even with everything I do deal with.   I tried to explain this to my friend - that they've never been hiding, they've just been easier for everyone else to ignore. I said I've never been glad, that I couldn't ever be glad. He told me we were all on the same side and I...was just so terribly disappointed.   Here's the thing. You can't be on someone's side if you're not listening to them. Every time these nazi rallies happen, it hurts. And it hurts all over again when someone who has never had to deal with it tells you how you should be feeling.   \"Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.\" - MLK.",

        "description": "Jen Hatmaker Dear ones, this is my yearly PSA because I am here for you and sometimes we forget things:   By the end of your cherubs' first week of school, they are:   D  O  N  E.  Listen to me: do not go to \"celebration dinner\" Friday night, do not go to the late football game, do not decide to run errands, do not make big plans, do not ask one million questions, do not force them to talk about everything, do not attempt to execute ANYTHING AT ALL in which your expectations include children who are pleasant.   They are like overfilled balloons. Should you accidentally push them too hard by, for example, asking them to chew with their mouths closed or making suggestions for dinner or any other unreasonable pressure, they will violently burst and ruin the thing you were dumbly considering as a Fun Family Situation.   Your Friday night plans after the first week of school need to involve a couch, some blankets, a pizza, and a movie. That is it. That is all anyone can handle. Your kid will make it past the first twenty minutes tops. They are all goners. Do not put them in the car and try to go somewhere, because they will turn your car into the Crazy Train.   Ditto: Saturday morning plans.   Ditto: That whole first weekend.   Your mission should you choose to accept it because you are a Smart Person is to do and plan nothing the first weekend after school starts. Let their little bodies catch up. They are exhausted after their summer of being sloth children who now have to think and pay attention for seven hours a day.   Plus, first week of school emotions. Plus, change. Plus, new scenarios and teachers and students and schedules. Plus, that one mean girl. Plus, figuring out where to sit at lunch. Plus, all the new rules. Plus, recess politics. Plus, homework. Plus, did their clothes/shoes/hair/backpack fit in right. Plus, the bus. Plus, they learned the F word on the playground and everything feels weird.   Trust your friend Jen: couch, blanket, pizza, movie. That's your weekend plan. Cancel everything else. You're welcome. Matt Waddell Joani Shawn Nicole Amber",

        "description": "Jen Hatmaker Yesterday after the church massacre, I was all fire and fury and rage and wailing. Ready to fight. Ready to march. Ready to burn down the establishment. Ready to chain myself to the doors of the White House.   Today, my adrenaline has receded and I am sick with sadness. My heart is so grieved. I am so sad and sorrowful for that sweet little town, that sweet little church. Brandon and I cannot quit staring at the TV as they mourn in shock. We are crushed. Again. I don't even kn ... ow how to pray.   I'm too tired to debate, so I won't do it. I'm just going to speak to those of you who want to see common sense gun reform. Not take all the guns. Not abolish the 2nd amendment. I will not fight your straw men. I just want basic common sense reform. I am a hunter's daughter, a hunter's wife, and the mom of three hunters. I am sending a son to college for Wildlife Management. I am not anti-gun. I am anti-gun violence.   If you are too, see the link below to join the work of  Everytown for Gun Safety  who is on the ground pushing for common sense gun reform. They have the numbers of your congressmen/senators and petitions to sign and plenty of research if you are in the inquiry phase.   You can fight all you want in the comments. I'm not here for it today. Zero engagement from me. Just know it. I'm weary of the debate. Yesterday was the 307th mass shooting in the US this year on the 307th day of the year. I'm done arguing that the sky is not falling.   If you want to join the movement for basic gun reform, this is a good place to start.   We are so sorry, Sutherland Springs.    https://everytown.org/act/   See More",
