I figured I'd just send out a message instead of making events, considering the short notice...\n\nFirst show is for a block party and will be around South San Fransisco, at Custom Sound, 5pm. We are playing for 30min to 1 hour I think. The block party has a bunch of food and other bands playing music until 8 tonight, and other bands have already started playing (at 3pm).\n\nSecond show is at Cheeba Hut, for a welcome back to school thing. We will play there at 7:30pm to 8pm. \n\n\nAlso, for Tuesday, Sept 1st, we [should be] playing at the KJACK open house, which is an event on facebook already (I'm signed up for it). \n\nHope to see you at one of the shows!\n\n"
