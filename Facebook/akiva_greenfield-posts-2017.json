What do you think?  Yitzchak must have had a plan, right? He knew that Yaakov was a good guy and he knew E ... sav was not the best guy in BMG. So what was his plan?  Often the answer given is that he intended on some sort of partnership. I like this idea. So he intends to give the blessing of material success to Esav and create a partnership akin to the Yisachar - Zevulun relationship. Esav provides for Yaakov while Yaakov provides spirituality for Esav.  Let's assume this is what Yitzchak wanted when he told Esav to go get him some food before he blessed him. What would have been the ideal thing for Esav to do in Yitzchak's mind? [think about it...]  Yitzchak would have wanted Esav to get the food and BRING YAAKOV to the tent for Yitzchak's blessing. After all, if they are to be partners, it would make sense that the partnership begins now. Esav SHOULD have gone to fetch Yaakov. But he doesn't.  When Yaakov sneaks into the tent, Yitzchak is not shocked that Yaakov is there. The food arrived too, so he assumes that Esav IS THERE as well. Yitzchak thinks that Yaakov and Esav are there TOGETHER. Thus, HaKol kol Yaakov, v'hayadayim y'dei Esav! The voice is the voice of Yaakov and the hands are the hands of Esav. Just as it is meant to be! Yaakov's voice of Torah and Esav's hands of material success. The partnership lives! (In Yitzchak's mind.)  So in Yitzchak's mind, he blesses Esav with material success while Yaakov is present. Esav is blessed that he will be a \"gvir\" (a provider) for Yaakov so Yaakov can study.  After Yaakov leaves, Esav enters. Yitzchak feels fear. Why fear? Well, if Esav did not fetch Yaakov, then Yitzchak just gave the WRONG blessing to Yaakov! Esav is not supposed to work for Yaakov! That makes no sense. Yaakov doesn't even work! That's why Yitzchak must bless Yaakov again before he searches for a wife. The second blessing is the blessing of Avraham - the man who was blessed \"bakol\" - the man who had \"everything\" - the material and the spiritual. There is no partnership anymore. Yaakov gets everything Yitzchak inherited from Avraham. Esav is cut out of the partnership.  If you look at the verses, it's actually pretty cool. You can see how it's possible that Yitzchak was actually addressing TWO sons the entire time with some questions for one and some for the other. The strongest indication of all this might be in verses 21,25, and 26. First Yitzchak feels the skin of Yaakov. Then he says \"come close and bring me the food\" and then he says \"come close and kiss me.\" It would be pretty strange to keep telling the same person to come close. But if he is going from one son to the other it makes more sense.  There are other questions that this answers too, but I've said enough. I know this sounds wild and I don't think anyone else says it. Think about it. Look at the verses. Tell me what you think.

When we admired their extraordinary art collection, Moshe insisted we take several Italian glass blown vases and a painting – right off the shelf and wall! - as wedding presents. It's a small memory, but really speaks to Moshe's extraordinary generosity, kindness, aesthetic and warmth. He was such a beautiful and gracious soul, so tragically plucked from this earth. He will be missed. ברוך דיין האמת. My heart goes out to his wonderful family.",

        "description": "Noah Greenfield I just learned of the passing of one of the most important and impactful educators in my life, my high school principal, on again and off again חברותא, and friend, Rabbi  Dovid Landesman , זצ׳׳ל. (And I emphasize the totally atypical but nevertheless astounding צדקות of the man. See below.)  In elementary school and junior high, as a kid branded as a \"troublemaker\", I would daydream about having a \"cool\" principal, someone who wouldn't be a draconian disciplinarian, someone whose office wouldn't be synonymous with punishment, someone who would make school fun and interesting, someone who would see my precociousness (=smartassness) as a blessing instead of a nuisance.  My first memory of meeting Rabbi Landesman was on one of the first days of my 9th grade. I was cutting class. He was sitting outside, leaning against a wall, smoking. When he said hello, I thought, \"Oh no! I am busted!\" Half in terror, half kicking myself, we started chatting. About an hour later, he looked at his watch and said, \"We are both going to get in trouble if we don't head back to where we belong.\"   I don't remember what we spoke about, but I pretty quickly learned a few things:  1) Rabbi Landesman was genuinely interested in me, my opinions and the things I cared about (or thought I cared about.)  2) Rabbi Landesman was extremely fun. He was super smart, but amazingly capable of bringing complicated ideas down to a dumb ninth grader's level. He didn't have a shred of sanctimoniousness to him. He was willing to talk about anything, any time. No issues were off limits - indeed, thinking outside the box was encouraged.  3) Rabbi Landesman's educational philosophy was premised on respect, freedom and responsibility. He had to impose some rules on his school, but he kept them to a basic minimum. Having a meaningful conversation was more important than being bored in class.   This was the educator I had been waiting for!  Right away, Rabbi Landesman earned my trust and respect without ever demanding it. Virtually every conversation I had with him challenged me deeply - intellectually, spiritually, personally (even if I would rarely give him the pleasure of admitting it).   His classes were like nothing else. He would pick a fight - based on an idea, a social issue - and get everyone heated up, arguing about it. Sometimes he would present a resolution that was satisfying, often times he wouldn't. It made my brain hurt - I loved it. I would often come back, sometimes weeks later, to tell him why he was wrong. Whether he agreed or not, he couldn't hide the satisfaction of having gotten an idea to stick. He loved nothing more than students arguing with him - heated and engaged - about ideas.   On Saturday nights, after doing whatever stupid things I'd do with my friends, I would drive by his home. Often, he'd be out on his porch, sitting by himself, smoking, over a book. I'd sit with him and tell him about all the idiotic things I had just done and he'd laugh - often disapproving, but still laughing. He had a profound understanding and appreciation for youthfulness.  When I had girl issues, he was the voice of reason. I introduced him to every high school love interest and he even invited one (visiting from out of town) for dinner, which was both highly awkward and fantastic. I couldn't bring a girl over to meet my parents, but I sure as hell was going to introduce her to my rabbi!  I am pretty sure most everyone in my class had a similarly close and caring relationship with Rabbi Landesman. Some of us got in trouble more with him, some less. (There were certain things, like damaging school property or one another, being disrespectful to teachers, etc, that would bring his foot down really hard.) Some of us got turned on to his critical thinking and deep Jewish spirituality, others didn't. But there was unanimous love.   At our graduation, we all pitched in to give him a silver goblet as a token of appreciation for his overflowing dedication to us. It was absolutely heartfelt.  Rabbi Landesman kept in touch years after I graduated. We hung out whenever he visited Israel during my yeshiva years. He signed the ketubah at my wedding. He had done so much to shape me as a man, as a Jew, and to usher me into adulthood, I couldn't imagine him not playing an integral role at that critical moment in my life.  I am so lucky to have had him as a teacher and friend. I fervently pray that my children have mentors like him and I hope I can do my part to teach them what he so passionately transmitted to his students: love of life, love of Torah, love of God, and love for one another.  I am terribly saddened by his passing. ברוך דיין האמת. יהי זכרו ברוך. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family. Shlomo Aaron Katz",

        "description": "Noah Greenfield Thinking about my late master teacher, Rabbi Joseph Weiss ztz\"l.  I had the extraordinary privilege of learning Yoreh Deah with Rabbi Weiss -  b'chavruta, just me and him - in his apartment on the Upper West Side most weekday mornings for several hours during the academic year of 2009-10. He had been teaching Yoreh Deah at RIETS since the 60s and had been teaching at YU since the 30s, which makes my year with him all the more undeserved and remarkable.   (I would often walk from his apartment on West End a few blocks up to that of another amazing teacher, the late saintly Michael Wyschogrod, ztz\"l. Both Weiss and Wyschogrod retained a European charm and mannerism that made every conversation a unique treat.)   The picture of Rabbi Weiss painted in the below article captures much of my experience of his (and his wife's, להבחל\"ח) spiritual intensity, intellectual power, and palpable kindness.   As a teacher, he was both fervent and patient. Even though he used a walker to get down the short hallway from his study to the dining room where we learned, in our discussions, he would often rise to his feet, waving his hands and arms, to make a point. Even though he had been teaching the same subject for about 50 years (!) by the time I got to him, he never seemed to mind my basic questions, my not-infrequent forgetfulness and my simple errors or misreadings.  One thing the article doesn't capture is that, as pure and fierce he was as a lamdan, he was an amazing schmoozer. He loved hearing all the latest \"hock\" (gossip) at YU and in the Jewish world in general. In exchange, he would tell me behind-the-scene stories of YU - going back to Revel and Belkin - and the many Torah sages he knew and interacted with - not just their Torah insights, but their human qualities and personal quirks.   One other thing the article doesn't fully capture - and, frankly, which I didn't and don't fully comprehend either - was Rabbi Weiss's unique Modern Orthodoxy. He was very much a product of Yeshiva University, despite his chassidic piety and total comfort with and attachment to the haredi world.   3 brief examples:  1) Rabbi Weiss told me that when he was dating his wife, a German immigrant (and descendant of R. Samson Raphael Hirsch, a picture of whom, clean shaven and in a clerical collar, hung in their dining room), he taught himself German - which was offered at the university at the time - to charm her. Similarly, when I told Rabbi Weiss that I had studied Arabic, I was surprised to learn that he had too - the better to learn Maimonides' original writings.  2) That year, I applied to and chose to attend the PhD program in Talmud at UC Berkeley. Frankly, I was afraid to tell Rabbi Weiss. I didn't think he'd understand my interest in academic Talmud or have any appreciation for it.  On the contrary, he was very happy for me and was quite supportive. He had a good idea about what was done in academic talmud, and while it wasn't for him, he didn't make the slightest insinuation to me that I shouldn't pursue it. He was all encouragement. (I should note, however, that when I tried to explain some insights from that world, he made it pretty clear that he did not find my explanations the least bit persuasive!) Indeed, he told me that his brother for many years lived and worked as a physicist in Berkeley and so knew it well. I gathered that his family, like so many others from that generation, did not all end up as spiritually committed as he did.  3) He made a point of having me bring over my wife, Nava, so that he and his wife could meet her and get to know her. We had several such visits, all of which were simply lovely. Both he and his wife frequently asked about Nava and were very impressed and enthusiastic about her pursuit of a medical career.  But the overwhelming memory I will have of Rabbi Weiss is as a Torah scholar. He was probably the only person in the world to have read every single article in Beit Yitzchak (the Hebrew-language Torah journal I helped edit at RIETS). His massive Torah library was seemingly entirely annotated, including not only the great classics, but many great works which are now neglected but which were widely studied in Europe. For example, he had a whole shelf of commentaries on the Pri Megadim, itself a super commentary, which he carefully studied and often quoted. He also made a point of encouraging me to study Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's much neglected Talmudic commentary, Dibros Moshe, which he said gave RMF much more pride than his more famous work of responsa, Igros Moshe.   When, at the end of our year together, I sought to get him a gift, his wife and I had to mine through his enormous library to find a worthwhile book that he didn't own. Eventually, we gave up and I got him the single volume of R Kapah's Mishneh Torah, to supplement the more elaborate multi-volume set already at his disposal. You can't go wrong buying a Brisker a Rambam.  He was elated.  יהי זכרו ברוך.",

        "description": "Akiva Greenfield Thank you all for the very kind birthday wishes. 33 was a great year, and I'm excited for what 34 will bring. Part of the reason why 33 was so great was because I've started to form some new habits that have been very helpful with my personal happiness:  1. I no longer read the newspaper, listen to talk radio, read lengthy political articles (except The New Yorker, can’t break that habit) and try to avoid talking politics with friends and family.  2. I removed email from my phone and only check email a couple of times a day (this has been a challenge, but it is something I hope to conquer this year).  3. Reading: I am trying to read 2 books a month. There were two books that I read this year that had a deep impact on my life, “How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia” by Mohsin Hamid and “Not Fade Away: A Short Life Well Lived” by Laurence Shames and Peter Barton, they came highly recommended and I still think about both books on a daily basis.  4. Podcasts: My friend Abe Malkin introduced me to StartUp and I’ve been obsessed with Podcasts ever since. I highly recommend StartUp, Foundation (Kevin Rose), and the Tim Ferris Show. If you see me sitting at a café or restaurant with headphones, I am not ignoring you, but am probably listening to Tim Ferris or Kevin Rose dissect the routines of highly successful people.  I’d love to hear what books, podcasts, or other “life hacks” have helped you find happiness and fulfilment in your personal life.",

        "description": "Ben Greenfield A comment that is not on the horrible news (I have nothing close to worthwhile to add) but is about the unfortunate FB rhetoric that I see in response to the news:  I get disheartened when I see people respond to a tragedy with an \"explanation\" to me of how the world works. (Or, given the de rigeur use of second person these days, an \"explanation\" written to some collective \"you\".)  See! - they post - this is how X and Y really work in America! Or, Dear Jewish people, you can't understand how X and Y really work because of Z! (This comes from the Left and from the Right. Just very different X's and Y's and Z's. And multiply by 5 for any news out of Israel.)    I think it is all a very peculiar way of saying, \"Oh my God, I'm so hurt. Oh my God, I'm so angry.\"    Or really, of saying: \"God: how loudly must I explain things before you see the pain I can't help but see?\"",

Not in order to agree with them; not to condescendingly \"explain\" them.  But to at least understand them.  Start by understanding their virtues.  2. Commit to passionately defend the first group that the next President harms, even if that group is not mine.  3. Foster hope.  There is a loooooong path between this and true horror.  Hope isn't a faith that everything is already OK, but a commitment to act as if you know that, eventually, it will be.   Please feel free to add your own.

        "description": "Akiva Greenfield One of the strongest forces for change, and for maintaining strong habits, is social accountability; whether it’s weight loss, exercise, charitable giving, or anything that is important to you. Facebook allows us to be socially accountable, as Kurt Vonnegut wrote “We are who we pretend to be”, with that said this is half a humble brag and half the social accountability that I rely on.   For the third consecutive year The Doctor’s Choice has been named to the Inc’s Fastest Growing Companies in America list. It’s been an incredible journey; I’ve learned a tremendous amount about myself in the process and I’ve been blessed with an amazing partner in David Wittenberg who has taught me to never take “no” for an answer.   Together, and mainly because of David’s grit, we have created over 400 jobs and have helped thousands of patients on their way to better health. Hopefully by keeping our comittment to our team and to our patients we will be on the Inc List for many more years to come. Chani Brazil Wittenberg",

        "description": "Ben Greenfield On this day of receiving my Semicha (ordination), I am honored, excited, delighted, and a tad tremulous to announce some amazing news:  I’ll be serving, this coming year, as the rabbi at  Bais Abraham Congregation  in St. Louis.    It is an interim position, as a truly remarkable Congregation takes its first steps forward after years of devoted, inspiring leadership from Rabbi  Hyim Shafner .  In my time exploring this option, I was struck by the warmth, thoughtfulness, support - dare I say, tenderness - of every lay leader and congregant that I met. Bais Abe is renowned nationally as a synagogue that is Orthodox and open-doored, intellectual and warm-hearted, and suffused with Midwestern sweetness. And I *felt* it, in all our conversations.   (And I hope to be a grounding and inspiring presence, at a vital transitionary time for the  community, as the Congregation conducts a year-long national rabbinic search, for which I am also contractually eligible. There, answered that logistical question  :)  The period of discernment over the last few months - as I explored a range of options - was trying but essential.  I am so grateful to the communities/institutions that invited me into their proverbial (and literal) living rooms. They might not know it, but each of my hosts was actually a mentor: helping me understand how I fit into the Jewish world and how I fit into my own understanding of a rabbi, and guiding me with the wisdom that only seaseoned lay leaders can offer.  Thank you. That process was (unbeknownst to me) the final and perhaps most essential piece of my rabbinic education.    It seems deeply un-rabbinic to have spent these weeks with questions of “what is right for me? What is best for me? Where are my strengths?” as the dominant themes in my mind.  But then again, those are the perfect questions for a rabbinical student.  That was the project of these four years.    Find myself, become myself, tease out my strengths, discover my future ... and do it through the lens of sacred texts and sacred training. I write these words at my Makom in the  Yeshivat Chovevei Torah  Beit Midrash - a place that for four years was my Home - as seemingly the last word of writing I will ever do in this exact seat, in this exact room, (with this exact Riverdale view), in this exact position as “rabbinical student”, after four years of learning, arguing, laughing, studying, riffing, and growing.    ***And now the questions turn.***  “What is right for this community? What are its strengths? What is its future? What role can I play in that shaping that larger story?”    And so I leave the Beit Midrash, and join a loving community in St. Louis that sees in me what I am only beginning to see: Rabbi Ben Greenfield.

May the People of Mordechai, who refused to bow in reverence before Haman's pride, support those who refuse to cower-in-body before the President's threats.  May the People of Abraham, who would not prostrate before a god which all his family, friends, neighbors, and leaders thought was a Right and True god, support those who challenge even our most familiar symbols.  And may the People who proclaim on Rosh Hashana, \"You are King over all kings\", take their own words seriously. May we recall that *ultimately* we stand for no one, bow for no one, kneel for no one, prostrate for no one ... but You.    Because when I stand for America's anthem -- and I proudly do -- it is only because I see in America hints of the Godly. But if I did not, I would be on my knees in a second.   (Were I - like Abraham, Mordecai, and Daniel - only so brave.) Ben",

If you are asking yourself what my qualifications are (and I'm sure  Rachel Einhorn Greenfield  is) I can assure you that there is only one redeeming quality--I care. And the things that I care about turn into my passion.  My hope is that in my term as President you will feel my passion for Judaism, education, community, personal growth, knowledge, excellence, technology, grit, and most importantly our children.  The Board and the Administration are going to be outlining some extraordinarily audacious goals and they will only be accomplished with your help. I'm looking forward to meeting each of you and getting to know you and your families.   Let's grab coffee (Wednesday mornings are best), let's chat (my cell is 323 243 6269), and let's build together. Rachel Einhorn Greenfield Akiva",
