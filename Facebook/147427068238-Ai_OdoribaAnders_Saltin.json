If you plan on going to clubs you will probably be carded.\n\n3) Please eat a big meal for lunch before 4. We will discuss stopping for dinner, but if possible I'd like to just eat snacks and eat dinner when we get there.\n\nIf you have any last minute concerns or suggestions, please let me know!\n\n~Steve\n\n"

I find that I usually need at least a light jacket at night, sometimes even during the summer. So I advise everyone to pack one, just in case.\n\n"
