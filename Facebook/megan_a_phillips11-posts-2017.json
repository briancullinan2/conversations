We all need shelter in order to stay safe in this weather, and  Boyle Street Community Services ‚Äô warming bus is an integral piece of the puzzle that helps keep folks experiencing homelessness safe, warm and off the streets in extreme temperatures.  But this year, the warming bus is short on funds. Boyle Street is asking for donations, and we want to help too. We will match funds up to $1000, so we ask if you have anything to spare, please consider donating to this necessary and worthy cause.  You can donate through this link:  https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/WebLink.aspx‚Ä¶ Karen Peterson Chris Yasushi John Ohki",

        "description": "Megan Ashlee Phillips For the past few months, I have been in an incredibly dark place. I have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and unbelievable stress that has impeded my ability to even get up in the morning or go to school. This semester I was home more times than I was at school because I just couldn't bear the thought of going out into the world. I have never been so closed off and alone in my entire life, and many times everything felt absolutely hopeless.   I am slowly coming out of that dark place. I have been forcing myself to get out of the house, go to school, and face the fears I have. I have reached out to my professors who have been incredibly understanding, and I'm doing what I have to do to make up for what I missed out on. I am now feeling much better and determined to take on the world.  This is a reminder to all of you out there who are going through hard times: this too, shall pass. Even when it feels like it is never going to end, trust me, it will. There is always a light at the end of a tunnel. The biggest mistake I made was not reaching out to anyone or letting anyone know what was going on. I wish I had because I know it would have made things more bearable for me. That being said, if anyone that is reading this feels hopeless or alone, this is an open invitation to talk to me. I'll talk to anyone, about anything. I'm a great listener. Afterall, sometimes all we need is to know that someone out there will listen.",
