        "description": "Vuurwapen Blog Bumpfire stocks are a relatively new phenomenon. Before that, it was just a \"skill\" people had developed by hooking a thumb in their belt and...something. I don't know.   Today, the NRA came out in support of regulations banning bumpfire stocks. I do not think this will be met with the unanimous support of NRA members - not because they love bumpfire, but because they don't want to cave on gun control. This approach has not been ineffective, but I suggest we try, just once, a slightly different course of action.  The SHARE act has reportedly been sidelined in the aftermath of the Las Vegas attack. It would, among other things, remove silencers from the NFA registry. Gun owners want it passed. Presumably, the NRA wants it passed. But instead of saying they'd support a bumpfire stock ban if the SHARE act was passed, they paid minor lip service to a national carry permit reciprocity deal at the end of their announcement - after everyone except me had stopped reading, I bet.   This should change. I'm willing to bet that unless you work for SlideFire Systems, you care less about the availability of bumpfire stocks than the cost and regulatory hassles associated with suppressors.

        "description": "Franklin Redensek It's rare for a mass shooter to be female: Less than three percent of killers in public mass shootings over the last three decades have been women, according to a database compiled by Mother Jones.  Even in the broader category of mass killings, which includes other methods of execution, such as arson, only six percent of perpetrators are female, according to a database compiled by USA TODAY.  Jodi Upton, who runs the data journalism team at USA TODAY, told NBC News that about 70 percent of mass killings are done by firearms — but not usually the ones committed by women.  \"There's very few women who commit mass killings. But of those who do, there's a slight tendency to prefer drownings or strangulation or arson,\" she said in July.  Sounds like men are more of a common factor in these incidents than the firearms themselves.",

So, Veterans Day is coming up on Saturday and this week I’ve been really placing emphasis on talking to Frank about good memories he had when he served and things about being a corpsman and asking him if he wants to go back to school to do medical stuff and today I want to focus on something else. I want to focus on how he still serves his community with the knowledge he has.   Today is the 4th time I’ve witnessed him jump out of our car and run to someone who’s badly hurt in a wreck to try and help them medically because he knows how to help. Today the man was flagging for assistance and my husband is the one who jumped in.  I’ve watched him protect someone from being mugged outside of a bar.  I’ve heard this story 80 times about how he stopped a man with a gun from harming people, from local bar tenders at one of our favorite bars.   I’ve watched him perform minor medical stuff at the house and teach me things that could save our lives in an emergency.   That man seriously impresses me on a level no one could ever.  I’m married to a real life super hero.  I’m always so proud of him. Franklin Redensek Franklin Redensek Franklin Redensek",

Not only has he helped me move around while I’m recovering, he cleaned the entire apartment so that it would be nice in here for me.  He’s gotten me medical devices installed in the house that make it easier to grip and he waits on me hand and foot. He’s taking full responsibility for my dogs and making sure they’re going out 4 times a day at least and not once has he complained about it.   I seriously couldn’t have asked for a better husband.  So thankful to have him supporting me rn.  Thank you Frank for making my life so much easier during this.  I love you Dingus.",

Thank you so much for helping me while I’m recovering from my procedure.  You’ve entirely taken on all the house chores, stepped up your emotional support game and are taking care of all the animals.  I appreciate you so much. You are doing all this and yet you still find time to show me you love me by spending time.  I see you out here being the perfect husband anyone could’ve asked for.  I love you to the moon and back Dingus.  Thank you for being someone I’m proud to call my husband. Someone I’m proud to know.  You’re my best friend in the entire world and not a day goes by in which I don’t love you more than the last one.  Love,  Your Dingus",
