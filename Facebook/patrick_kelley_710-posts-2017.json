        "description": "Patrick Kelley \"One of these days he'll look back on this and laugh.\"  When I was about six my childhood best friend and I were playing ball in his back yard. I fielded his hit and met him at 'first base' ... or rather my head met the bat he had forgot to drop.  It split the skin over my eye and required a couple of stitches, and the above quote was what my mom said to his mother, who was horrified about the whole thing.  Well, today I noticed the scar and had this sudden picture of myself, screaming for the back door, but ending up at the front door because one eye was closed and bleeding and the other full of tears so I couldn't see where I was going.  Meanwhile, his mom had heard the fuss and was frantically trying to catch up to me.  I don't know why but the image made me laugh out loud.  How did Mom know?  Anyway, I doubt she'll ever see this but Mrs. Ball, Mike didn't mean to hit me.  And it was an awesome Pitcher-to-First play, even if it was a 1-on-1 game. I hope you got to laugh about it sometime, too.",

Formation flights including the Marine Corps Cobra helicopters and a group of Van's RV aircraft, lots of aircraft on display including the Spitfire parked in front of the hangar where the evening banquet will be held.  Talks by the Tuskegee Airmen, helicopter rides, Young Eagle flights for kids from 8-17, and a couple of projects on display.  Awesome fun for everyone.  I think I had around 50 kids sit in my unfinished airplane and I helped two boy scouts get their aviation merit badge by showing them how to do the pre-flight inspection of an airplane.  I'm sunburnt despite sunscreen, hoarse from talking, so tired I can hardly think, and still had a great time.  There'll be more pictures on the chapter website, once I've slept for a week or so, but these should capture the essence of the event.  I hope to see everyone next year when we do it again.",

Here's to our wives and sweethearts,  And may they never meet.  Here's champagne for our real friends  And real pain for our sham friends.  And when this journey finally ends,  May all of us find peace.  Here's to the women that I've loved  And all the ones I've kissed  As for regrets, I've just have one -  That's all the ones I've missed.  Ah, women's faults are many. We men have only two:  Every single thing we say and everything we do.  I wish you health; I wish you wealth  And happiness galore.  I wish you Heaven when you die,  What could I wish you more?  May your joys be as deep as the ocean;  Your troubles as light as its foam.  And may you find sweet peace of mind,  Wherever you may roam.",

It's the site about the Thunder Over Flagstaff fly-in which benefits EAA Chapter 856, allowing us to send a couple of youngsters to Oshkosh AirAcademy each year.  Aside from lots of planes, there's a car show and Young Eagle flights (approximately 15 minute flights for children 8 to 17 years old to introduce them to aviation).  Check out the site and spread it around among your friends.",

The oil filter will also be replaced with an adapter so I can put the filter in an easy-to-reach place.  It all looks good - no damage in shipping.

        "description": "Patrick Kelley Just when I think I've blocked every political/religious/etc. source on Facebook, my friends find new ones to share. *sigh* It'd be nice if we could block by category.  Just to clue you in, I friended my friends because I was interested in them, not their news/info channels.  If I was interested in stuff like that, I'd already be following it. If it says to like and share, only do the first part.  I'll see that you liked it and then I can make up my own mind if I want to check it out.  What I really want to hear from my friends is about them.  New house? New car? New baby? Congrats on your graduation! Sick? Get well soon! You went to India? Post pictures! You see, I'm interested in my friends, not other people/groups.  Does that mean I don't care about my friends' political or religious leanings?  Not at all.  If you want to tell me about them, I'll listen.  But what you share isn't your own voice, it's someone else.  Give me your ideas, don't be a robot echoing someone else's message.  Some things are just to good to pass up.  Kittens and puppies, funny videos, upcoming events.  I'm Ok with sharing a good time with my friends. But when you share stuff intended to preach at me about some issue, that's not a good time and it's not friendly.  I try not to share posts about the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster or Vote C'thulu for Eternal President 2016 (I'm joking here because I didn't want to pick on any actual institutions).  Why don't you follow my example so I can remain  Your Friend",

I can't really speak to the Surface Pro 4, but my original Surface Pro (bought on release day) is upstairs being used to stream anime on my bedroom TV.  My Surface Pro 3, preordered and delivered on release day, has been used for teaching and is currently being used to develop a web app in Visual Studio.  I've only got a few month on the latest model, which I'm using right now.  I skipped the 2 and 4 models only because the previous models were working too well, making an upgrade really a vanity thing; in fact, I could have skipped the latest model, too, because the Pro 3 is still working great. By the way, my Surface devices tend to run 24/7.  Think about how long that original Surface Pro has been running.  When it comes time to get the next one, I'll take the risk that I might have to return a bad one, because MS will make it right and I'll end up with a device that will run for years.  And with better features than any laptop or hybrid out there.  CR doesn't do a bad job of reporting, mostly, but a consumer still has to do a little more research than just reading their reports.",

I'm just thinking about getting up when something hits the wall outside my bedroom.  Something large.  What the heck?!  So I pull on some clothes and go outside to see what it was.  The first photo is a smudge on the wall about 10 feet to the right of my bedroom window (that's the downstairs bath window in the picture).  As I open the back yard gate to go have a closer look, there's a commotion on the hood of my neighbor's car and a duck rises off of it and flies unsteadily away, leaving a trail of blood spots across my drive.  Apparently it rebounded from the wall and landed on the hood of his car, lying stunned until I came through the gate.  What a way to start the day!  Having something hit your house will really get your attention.",
