I saw you're starting to look for new positions, and I thought we could set up a time to discuss your background and what you'd like in your next role.\n\nI actually have a position right now that I think could be a good fit for you, it's a Sr. Architect role, and I'd be happy to discuss it with you.\n\nLets set up a time to chat, do you have time today? Or, could we set up another time this week?\n\n\nThanks!\nRuss\n\nRuss Dudas\nNational Technical Recruiter\nRandstad Technologies\n781-287-9622\nRuss.Dudas@Randstadusa.com\n"
