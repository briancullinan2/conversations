        "description": "Greg Cardinal  was with  Joe Mac Alick  and  41 others . New album coming soon   \"Winning Souls\"   Approaching life in different ways influenced by his mercy and Grace  Intro: is there any place that you can hide from God's light  Is anyone righteous or even appear in his sight  In his eyes the Stars aren't even pure nor is the moon even bright  He hides the moon behind the clouds dividing the darkness light  When he threatens the pillars that hold up the sky they shake in fear of his might  The strength caucus to see he destroys every demon he fights  He shows how great his power is first by giving us life  That's why I read words that's my sword so I can be sharp as a knife  In your eyes he might not be fair but he always does what is right  He brings us happiness and joy as we come to his light  Even in trouble times when it seems like the darkest of nights  You may not get to see him but he's been here all of our life's  He provides for a daily and blesses us with kids in the wife  You can try and deny it but greatness comes from the struggles and strifes  He allows us to struggle in order to open our sights  He gives out his wisdom when the timings just right  When we're living for him is when the devil starts to strike  But as soon as he does again God shows us his might   1: Song _ \"Come Get Saved\"  Chorus:   Come get saved by his mercy and Grace Give praise to his name as we worship and pray  Divert from your ways and always keep faith   For this is the way we reach them Heavenly Gates   ×2  Verse 1:   See I give thanks and give praise   To the Lord everyday as i pray  That I'm not in a grave for my sinful ways  Only through his actions that they have I been saved  He's a lord of Grace yeah a Lord that saves  He carries our burdens day after day  From Death he raised and went to a holy place  He stops storms that rage and calms the roaring waves  There's Commandments he's made yeah laws that he's laid  And if we disobey there's a price to be paid  Never ending days in the fiery Lake  But if we choose to obey then we'll be okay   And that promise place will be saved  In the Mansion he's made  So just keep some faith and try to stay  On the path that he's paved  He'll lead the way and keep you safe  He gives us strength to deal with hate  Obedience and faith is all it takes to seal your fate  Is the best-selling author even in this day and age  So read his words that are placed on the page  Plain as day right in front of your face  There's no excuse or no way you can't choose to just change  The results would be great if you choose to just make  The decision today to take on all of his ways  Chorus:  So come get saved by his mercy and Grace Give praise to his name as we worship and pray  Divert from your ways and always keep faith   For this is the way we reach them Heavenly Gates   ×2  Verse 2:  His greatness is displayed all through this world today  A words we still have in as we give him praise  We look towards the sky in which he has made  And no he set the moon and the stars in their rightful place  But before it falls apart there's a choice to be made  So decide in your heart before that righteous day  Which one of those paths that you're going to take  Ones wide and ones narrow but when you reach them Gates  There's no turning back from the choice that you made  You can choose his wrath or you can choose his grace  But you should choose fast before it's too late  Cuz life in an act all you get is one take  Chorus:   So come get saved by his mercy and Grace Give praise to his name as we worship and pray  Divert from your ways and always keep faith   For this is the way we reach them Heavenly Gates   ×2   More songs in the making need somewhere to record Josie Reynolds Jordan Ledford Jordan Jones Shane Velasquez Theo Rodgers",
