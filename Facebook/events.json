            "Details For the first time ever, join Joel Hodgson, creator of the critically acclaimed  Mystery Science Theater 3000  TV show and its new host Jonah Heston (Jonah Ray) as they bring the first live touring production of “MST3K” to the historic Orpheum Theatre, in downtown Phoenix, on the “Watch Out for Snakes!” Tour.     Appearing with Joel and Jonah live on stage will be robot companions Crow (Hampton Yount), Tom Servo and Gypsy, along with Synthia (Rebecca Hanson) and her Bonehead henchmen. Of course, it wouldn’t be “MST3K” without the ever-present surveillance of the Mads, Kinga Forrester (Felicia Day) and TV’s Son of TV’s Frank (Patton Oswalt), checking up on their unwilling test subjects via a video screen.     The tour ...  consists of a completely unique show. Each event will include all the things expected from an “MST3K” experience: a cheesy B-movie, hilarious riffing, wisecracking robots, silly sketches, plus – for the first time – audience participation! Show # 1 is the MST3K favorite “Eegah,” featuring all-new riffs and sketches.    Following its record-breaking #BringBackMST3K Kickstarter campaign, the new season of the show launched on April 14, 2017, exclusively on Netflix. The two live shows are written by the cast and writers of the new Netflix Original Series, which has earned a critics’ rating of 100% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.. The New York Times hails, “At last, a revival of something actually worth reviving… a different cast but the same outlook and style — and mercifully, the same reliable, giddy humor.”  “MST3K is just as hilarious as ever in rebooted form, turning its bemused eye on old, schlocky fare for some good, old-fashioned riffing,” raves Vanity Fair. And Nerdist says “The references are updated, the sets are snazzier, but the heart and soul of MST3K certainly remains intact.”      Tickets for “MST3K” “Watch Out for Snakes!” Live at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix will go on sale to the public Friday, May 19 at noon local time via  AXS.com  and the venue box office at  phoenix.ticketforce.com , or by calling 877-840-0457.

In this meditative gong bath we allow the gong sound to bring the healing and integration of our body, mind, and soul.    The gong is a powerful healing sound. Gong sends waves that are a combination of overtones and undertones. It creates deep relaxation, freeing us from the flood of thoughts our mind releases, and stimulates the glandular system to a higher level of functioning. It affects the physical nervous system, not just hearing it through the ears, but the sensation of feeling it on the skin. The gong sound vibrates the energy meridians in the body and brings them into balance. Kundalini energy, which begins at the base of the spine is  ... released, traveling upwards along the spine through the body. Sound travels and the body picks up a sound. It’s also a cleansing process for the subconscious mind. During the gong meditation, emotional transformation is produced as it reduces tension, releases blocks and stimulates circulation. The result is a reorganization of the emotional energy and feelings that are tied into the body structure. The gong changes feelings that are blocked by cutting the thoughts that sustain and recreate the feelings. During the gong bath let the entire body relax and let the sound of the gong penetrate the body and guide the mind.    * Wear comfortable clothing    * Bring mat &/or blanket to lie down on    * Hydrate before & after the gong; helps nerve function & cleansing of body    ~Welcoming Niki Shields to serenade the space     $15 before 6/23  $20 drop~in      The Gong is the spirit song.

INTL ($5 well & $3 beer) shake your booty all night    Twisting the holiday paradigm until it screams for mercy is fun! Getting arrested is not. Santa Claus is friendly, respectful, and cooperative with police officers, security guards, bouncers, and store owners and doesn't break any laws! \"Disorderly Conduct\" is not a merit badge. Have your own special twisted fun, but don't fuck it up for the rest of us! Our santas do not destroy property, steal merchandise, or do harm to others. The authorities and local businesses usually take Santa's antics in the loving holiday spirit Santa intends, so be nice to them. Seriously - don’t argue. If they don’t want Santa there, Santa should move along.    REMEMBER THE ANSWER IS: SANTA    Who's in charge? SANTA  Who are you with? SANTA  What organization are you with? SANTA  Who organized this? SANTA  Who just snap chatted a picture of their junk to me? SANTA    *****    Bring ID  Bring cash for drinks (don't forget the tip!).  Bring cell phone. Look for updates on this event page.  Bring comfy shoes and warm clothes.  Bring candy and crap for the patrons we meet.  Bring a camera.  Bring your loud ass and your singing pipes.  Bring your Santarchy Carol Book            ************* more info ************************    YOU MUST BE IN FULL CHRISTMAS COSTUME!  Slacks and a hat are *NOT* Christmas costume. An ugly sweater is DEFINITELY NOT Christmas costume. There are events for that stuff, but this event is not one of them.       This is very important. You will be a Santa in a huge group of  Santas. Lines at some bars will be long. This is inevitable, though  we have tried our best to mitigate this as much as possible. Do not bring outside drinks into any bar or restaurant. And remember that drinking alcohol on the streets is illegal. Santa does not have any special permits or permission to be exempt from these laws.    Finally, by showing up, you acknowledge that being Santa can be risky business. You accept all consequences that could potentially arise from your personal participation and any participation of others which may affect you.   See More",

            "Details 21+ / 8pm doors/ ONLY $5!  River Whyless -  RIVERWHYLESS.COM  Asheville, North Carolina's River Whyless is a band much like that titular body of water - a mingling of currents, a flow of time and physical space, all brought together in a murmuring sense of purpose. It is the expression of a group of musicians, three of which are songwriters, who have played together in various forms since their college days in the North Carolina mountains. Their forthcoming EP, their first release since their 2012 debut album, is the next evolution of the band's collective voice.    Composed of Ryan O'Keefe (guitars, vocals), Halli Anderson (violin, vocals), Alex McWalters (drums, percussion) and Daniel Shearin (bass, vocals, harmon ... ium, cello, banjo), the band is preparing to release a self-titled EP, their first effort since 2012, on January 20th.    (\"Like Fleet Foxes, River Whyless have a contemplative, relaxed style. The instrumentation weaves together seamlessly, a high point being Anderson’s violin playing, and the band’s soothing harmonies.\" ~ Bruce Warren, WXPN    “Hailing from the mountains of NC, River  Whyless puts a hauntingly sweet spin on traditional  foundations. ” -Michael, Bandcamp Staff Pics)    The Blenders-    David Strackany-   See More",

            "Details It is time once again for that most important holiday of the year! I assume you all have already marked your calendars and asked for time off from work if needed. And now we must work together to organize hotel rooms and rides.    For those of you who haven't attended previously, you are obviously aware of the importance of this event, and have been informed that your attendance is of course mandatory.    Seriously. We'll unfriend you.    As in previous years, our own Mike Brooks will be giving a talk. I'll post the time and track number so that you can be sure not to miss it. Get there early, as last year I had to wait 10 minutes to sit on the floor along the back wall to hear Mike's talk. I hear there will be an ex ... tra 400 seats per track or something this year though.    Badges are $150 for males who want to attend talks. If you are a male who isn't interested in the talks, or can't afford a badge, there will still be much fun to be had, and you can sometimes borrow a badge from someone who isn't currently using it. Badges for females have previously turned out to be entirely optional. (The discrepancy here is in the hopes of creating more interest in the field among females, to discourage the gender disparity. That's totally the reason.)    In our previous experience, organizers seem very disinterested in enforcing drinking-age restrictions, and appear to do the legal minimum with regard to enforcement. Being under 21 should not be a major hurdle to participating in activities, even if alcohol is present.    Although I don't have a full list of events yet, the first event people are generally interested in attending is the toxic barbecue at ~6 PM on Thursday. The last event is the award presentation at ~2 PM on Sunday. These are optional events of course, and many will be arriving later or leaving earlier as needed. The times I listed above for the Facebook event should be good for capturing these two events. I, for example, will be leaving later, and might miss at least part of the toxic barbecue. I'm sure there are others who will want to work Friday, and not make it up until that night or Saturday morning. See discussion.    For those who really truly aren't interested in the technical stuff, I encourage you to let us try to change your mind at least a little bit. (Not even just a little lockpicking workshop? You'll have fun we swear!) But there are still lots of other things to do. There's drinking and partying of course. The Star Trek convention's that weekend too I think (but I have been misinformed on this point before). And, of course, it is VEGAS. :-) There's talk of Pen and Teller, which I think is in the same hotel as the convention this year actually... There will surely be swimming. And just like last year, we'll have a game of chasing drunk Travis around the city.     https://www.defcon.org/   See More",

Starring his own 12 year old son Brontis alongside Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, David Carradine ...  and Salvador Dali, featuring music by Pink Floyd and art by some of the most provocative talents of the era, including HR Giger (who later designed the nightmarish look of Ridley Scott’s Alien) and Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, Jodorowsky’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved novel Dune was poised to change cinema forever. For two years, Jodo and his team of “spiritual warriors” worked night and day on the massive task of creating the fabulous world of Dune: over 3,000 storyboards, numerous paintings, incredible costumes, and an outrageous, moving and powerful script. In the words of Jodorowsky’s producer, Michel Seydoux, “It should have been enough. But it wasn’t.” Through interviews with legends and luminaries including Giger, Gary Kurtz (producer of Star Wars) and Nicolas Winding Refn (director of Drive), and an intimate and honest conversation with Jodorowsky himself filmed over the course of three years, director Frank Pavich’s film – featuring never-before-seen realizations of Jodo’s mind- blowing psychedelic space opera – finally unearths the full, unbelievable saga of the Dune that never was.

A People’s Choice award will be announced at the close of the exhibition. All visitors to the exhibition will have a chance to vote for the People’s Choice award.      The Recycled Art show is organized every year through a partnership with Flagstaff Cultural Partners, the Artists’ Coalition of Flagstaff, and the City of Flagstaff. All artwork in the show must contain at least 80% recycled or reused materials. The possibilities are endless, and the exhibition is a testament to the creativity of the artists and community of Coconino County. The purpose of the exhibition is to encourage the reuse of a variety of materials in new, different, and creative forms and to promote recycling and resource conservation.     Artists will offer workshops and demonstrations to the public on creating recycled works each Saturday throughout the run of the exhibition. These will take place on April 14, 21, 28, and May 5 and 12. A full list of workshops will be posted soon on  culturalpartners.org/ recycled.htm .

We discussed going somewhere besides Puerto Peñasco this year, but travel time and cost seem to be limiting factors. If anyone has ideas, let me know.    The earliest I can leave is Wednesday night. Also, Thursday morning, Thursday night, and Friday morning would work, depending on everybody's schedule. Thoughts?    They say you need a passport. They've been saying that for years. We haven't had a problem yet. It's up to you if you don't want to risk it, but so far we've made it through every time.    As for safety, the area we're going is extremely safe. The US State Department travel advisory for Puerto Peñasco says you shouldn't drink and drive, and should be careful of road conditions on dirt roads. The State Department specifically endorses our route as well.    You should come! It will be fun!",

            "Details ***THIS WEEK AND THIS WEEK ONLY UK THURSDAY MOVES TO WEDNESDAY TO NOT INTERRUPT YOUR TURKEY DAY PLANS WITH SPECIAL GUESTS: URBAN ASSAULT (aka Faust & Shortee)***    Urban Assault (aka Faust & Shortee) have been a powerhouse in the DJ/Production world for the last 16+ years electrifying audiences on a global scale. Specializing in the grimy beats & filthy bass line genres of Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Drumstep and Electro House, this dynamic duo continues to awe masses worldwide both in the studio & on stage complete with live 4 turntable DJ trick sets scratched to perfection.      Ranked as one of the top 5 Turntablists in the world by SPIN Magazine, Faust released the first turntablist album in history, the critically  ... lauded Man Or Myth and continues to push the boundaries of his production today in various genres. Shortee is acknowledged as one of the most diverse, technically skilled female DJs in the world, described as “The World’s Premier Female DJ” by the Grammy Foundation and named “Queen of the Scratch World” by DJ Times.     Both were featured in the award-winning documentary “SCRATCH” (Palm Pictures) marking their historical contribution to the art of DJing and Turntablism. Together their solo & team albums have earned them critical acclaim in major publications like SPIN, URB, Remix, Knowledge, ATM, DJ Times, Rolling Stone etc., while their music is featured on networks such as MTV, NBC, CNN, HBO, ESPN and more.     In addition to rocking stages globally, Faust & Shortee are constantly in the studio producing music for release on various record labels as well as their own imprints. They successfully run two multi-genre labels: Heavy Artillery Recordings (House / Drum & Bass / Breaks / House / Dubstep / Drumstep) and 5 Star Records (Hip Hop / Battle / DJ Tools). Their original tunes and remixes frequent the Top10 charts on the regular and some have held the #1 spot for weeks at a time. A few of their most popular Heavy Artillery EPs include “Scarface”, “Kid Dynomite”, “Lose Control” and “Dope” and their tune “Away” was nominated for the ‘Best Jungle/D&B track’ in the 2008 International Dance Music Awards. In addition, their infamous “Red Raider” EP, held the #1 spot on both Beatport & TrackItDown and was ranked as one of TrackItDown’s Top10 Drum & Bass releases of 2009, alongside such artists as Sub Focus, Deadmau5, Chase & Status, Noisia, DJ Fresh and The Prodigy, and it still continues to return to the charts time & time again today.     Whether they appear as ‘Faust & Shortee’ or disguised as the grimy “Urban Assault”, the bass line is always front and center. Their ambitious schedule shows no signs of letting up as they continue to bang out killer beats in the studio and drop devastating bass on stages worldwide.

            "Details The trees are changing!  The most beautiful place I know of to watch the trees change in Arizona is Hart Prairie.  We should all go there, and have a picnic!    If you want, bring a blanket, and some picknicky food to share.    DRESS VERY WARMLY, and in layers.  If it's sunny and calm, it'll be warm.  If it's cloudy and windy, it could be VERY cold.  No chickening out though.  If it's too cold, or precipitizing, we'll eat inside the biggest car. :-)    A portion of the journey is on a well-maintained dirt road.  This is the most important part of the journey, and a VERY scenic drive.  However, it has snowed there recently, and the road may be muddy, or have a little snow in shady spots.  If you're not comfortable on  ... dirt roads, or don't think you have the car for it, you might want to either arrange to carpool with someone else, or park at the turnoff and let another car shuttle you in.  We should pile into as few cars as possible anyway, just to save gas.  And you'll have a lot more fun if you have others to share this drive with!    The location you get when you Google \"Hart Prairie\" is correct, though Google's route in has less dirt-road driving and is less scenic than the one I recommend.  Take 180 up, past the Snowbowl turnoff.  Exit right on Hart Prairie Road (Forest Service road 151).  Take it about 5 miles in.  Hart Prairie is the large, beautiful, golden prairie on the left.  Make it a loop by taking fire road 294 back to 180.  35°19'59.03\"N, 111°44'31.59\"W    Or just carpool with me!   See More",
