Maybe a nice black frock coat cause I really don‚Äôt have a coat at the moment.  3:There‚Äôs this Silent Hill game I‚Äôve not played called Resurrection ( I think) I‚Äôve not played I‚Äôd love.   4: oh, I dunno..... just please make sure you give my daughters their presents and I‚Äôll be happy although Jennifer  And I will try our best to see to it regardless.  See? I‚Äôm writing to Santa in the same useless way christians say thoughts and prayers. It‚Äôll have the same results.",

I think at first I was dreaming cause when I first woke, I distinctly heard the loud beeping of a forklift right in my left ear and remember thinking Jennifer‚Äôs son Max must be down here moving stuff around before I realized how silly that thought was. I was about to roll over but realized I couldn‚Äôt. I also felt like I was being pulled down towards the foot of the bed but was using a nightstand as a marker and knowing I wasn‚Äôt actually moving anywhere. Finally it happened. To my left was this humanoid shadow thing moving towards me. I was more fascinated than panicked. About the time it reached me it faded and I was finally able to move again. I get why people think spooks and demons are real. Had I not known exactly what was happening, I mighta came to the same realization. ‚ÄúShadow People‚Äù..... it‚Äôd been scarier if I coulda hallucinated Freddy Krueger .  üòÇ",

See, homosexuals have read the Bible too, they know what it says regarding their lifestyle. Now, they also know this true believer also claims to be their friend..... yet how can there be any meaningful friendship when they know their Christian ‚Äúfriend‚Äù believes deep down that homosexuality is immoral thereby making the homosexual immoral? What..... they claim friendship but also think the gay person is an abomination and is resigned to hell simply for the way they‚Äôre born? This is repulsive to me and the christian is putting on either false aires or just outright taking some sort of moral high ground when the moral absolute truths they hold so dear is full of nothing but hatred and death to those that would dare defy it.  These people would kill their child if they thought their god wanted it done and then have the audacity to say two men or two women sharing a bed and having relations with one another is an abomination! Lunacy. These same pious pricks also pretend to drink their saviors blood and eat his flesh and somehow think this is a holy thing to do. Where‚Äôs the logic in this?",
