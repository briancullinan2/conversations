It's probably cheaper for most people to ask their doctor to order the tests, but if you just want to check your vitamin D, go to Theranos, and pay $20. You can order a celiac panel for $31. Their prices are on their website, and they are cheap.  I'm glad my doctor checked my vitamin D last year, because I was terribly deficient. I now know that you need either midday sunlight or supplemental vitamin D to get enough vitamin D.  ",

        "description": "Julianne Bowles It really bothers me that people are so judgemental of others, particularly parents. No wonder people aren't having children. You don't parent perfectly and suddenly you're a horrible parent. I read this account of the whole gorilla fiasco. And people still judge the parents in the comments!  I guess kids should just live in a cage at home (kidding).  (Not me )  My family and I decided to go to the zoo yesterday after visiting my neice at Cincinnati Childrens hospital. For those of you that have already heard,  there was a terrible accident there yesterday.  And since every news media has covered this story,  I don't feel bad telling our side. This was an accident! ! A terrible accident,  but just that!  My husband's voice is the voice talking to the child in one of the videos.  I was taking a pic of the female gorilla, when my eldest son yells, \"what is he doing? \" I looked down,  and to my surprise,  there was a small child that had apparently, literally \"flopped\" over the railing,  where there was then about 3 feet of ground that the child quickly crawled through! ! I assumed the woman next to me was the mother, getting ready to grab him until she says,  \"Whose kid is this? \" None of us actually thought he'd go over the nearly 15 foot drop,  but he was crawling so fast through the bushes before myself or husband could grab him,  he went over!  The crowed got a little frantic and the mother was calling for her son. Actually, just prior to him going over,  but she couldn't see him crawling through the bushes!  She said \"He was right here!  I took a pic and his hand was in my back pocket and then gone!\" As she could find him nowhere,  she lookes to my husband (already over the railing talking to the child) and asks, \"Sir,  is he wearing green shorts? \" My husband reluctantly had to tell her yes, when she then nearly had a break down!  They are both wanting to go over into the 15 foot drop,  when I forbade my husband to do so,  and attempted to calm the mother by calling 911 and assure her help was on the way. Neither my husband or the mother would have made that jump without breaking something!  I wasn't leaving with my boys,  because I didn't trust my husband not to jump in and the gorilla did just seem to be protective of the child. It wasn't until the gorilla became agitated because of the nosey, dramatic, helpless crowd;  that the gorilla violently ran with the child!  And it was very violent;  although I think the gorilla was still trying to protect,  we're taking a 400 lb gorilla throwing a 40 lb toddler around!  It was horrific!  The zoo responded very quickly,  clearing the area and attempting to save both the child and the gorilla!  The right choice was made. Thank God the child survived with non-life threatening, but serious injuries!  This was an open exhibit!  Which means the only thing separating you from the gorillas,  is a 15 ish foot drop and a moat and some bushes! ! This mother was not negligent and the zoo did an awesome job handling the situation!  Especially since that had never happened before! ! Thankful for the zoo and their attempts and my thoughts and prayers goes out to this boy, his mother and his family.",

        "description": "John McCain Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation.   It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security.   Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.  Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. John McCain John McCain",

Six decades ago – in the age of sail – I was an undistinguished member of the Class of 1958. My superiors didn’t hold me in very high esteem in those days. Their disapproval was measured in the hundreds of miles of extra duty I marched in my time here. To be honest, I wasn’t too thrilled to be here back then, and I was as relieved to graduate – fifth from th ... e bottom of my class – as the Naval Academy was to see me go.   I wasn’t the first or last midshipman to have had a complicated relationship with this place. But I realized a little later in life that I had underestimated the effectiveness of my education here. I hadn’t fully appreciated all that the Academy was trying to teach me until much later in life. Lessons about sacrificing for something more important than yourself. Lessons about courage and humility. About friendship. About the meaning and responsibilities of honor.  My appreciation for those lessons and for the friendships I made here bring me back often. So does my gratitude for the life of adventure the Naval Academy prepared me for, and for the privilege of being a bit player in the story of America that the Navy made possible.   See More",

There is no greater cause than the freedoms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, which our Navy defends around the world each and every day. As we reflect on the losses we have suffered, let us recall that the sailors we honored today had full claim to the honor of a grateful America, and that we were blessed to have them among us for as long as God ordained.",

These clashes are also emblematic of a broader, more troubling reality: Beyond our tactical successes in the fight against the Islamic State, the United States is still dangerously lacking a comprehensive strategy toward the rest of the Middle East in all of its co ... mplexity.  This is the unfortunate legacy that the Obama administration left for its successor.   If we keep sleepwalking on our current trajectory, we could wake up in the near future and find that American influence has been pushed out of one of the most important parts of the world. That is why Americans need to care about what is going on in the Middle East right now. That is why we need to stick with our true friends, like the Kurds. And that is why, now more than ever, we need a strategy that lifts our sights above the tactical level and separates the urgent from the truly important.   See More President Donald J. Trump",
