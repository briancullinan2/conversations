I will report later this month to my new location. I have mixed feelings as I've become close with a few great people both at work and locally here in Memphis. I'll miss this place but I'm ready to begin the next chapter of my career as I continue to progress within the VA system.  Thank you to everyone who has been a part of my journey.
