All of these have places they excel in. Unity3D is well supported and easy to build in, but can't handle large worlds well; a phone based VR system is very portable and easy to bring with you for ease of jus hopping in, but lack the comfort of something like the Vive; releasing on Steam gives. So I would try to limit the scope of reach for your prototype. The lowest common denominator for easy of testing is Unity3D and a Google Cardboard viewer. You can work with the atmosphere and get the feel right before diving into interface design.\n",
