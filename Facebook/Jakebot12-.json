I need to build a marketing site under that domain name and have it hosted. Would you be able to help me build the site and host it? How much would you charge?\nI remember that you had a private server room when I met you. I'd rather give you the money than some corporate giant web hosting business. I really don't know what I'm doing and I don't want to get ripped off.  It's for a new board game that my friend and I created.\n",
