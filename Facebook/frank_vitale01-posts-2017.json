        "description": "Ancient Explorers Hey  Ancient Explorers ! (a short message from our founder)  \"WOW! It's finally here.  😃  About 15 years ago, I began a journey to investigate the long lost city and civilization of Dwarka, India...where it is said that millions of people lived in a highly advanced kingdom thousands of years ago.   There are ancient references of an abundant civilization ruled by gods...with gold palaces, temples that soared like skyscrapers, beautiful gardens with advanced irrigation, streets laid out in a grid similar to Manhattan and advanced technology of all sorts...including flying machines (which was then all submerged under the sea 🌊 ).   From the 60's thru the 90's, the Indian Government found proof that this city existed underwater...but then suddenly stopped their research...  Crazy...right?   About 5 years ago, I embarked on a journey to actually GO to Dwarka....and through a series of coincidences...I ended up shooting a documentary about this ancient city. It was a completely last minute and unplanned trip.  Since then...the documentary has had over 2 million views, has become a lifelong mission called Ancient Explorers...AND...more recently it was picked up by  Travel Channel  's TV Series Expedition Unknown (hosted by  Joshua Gates  ) .  In January 2017...we went back to Dwarka where I led my first ever real life expedition with a 20 person crew...to uncover more about the lost civilization of Dwarka. We went trekking...we dug trenches...we went diving underwater...we used sonar equipment to scan the sea floor...we even pulled out an ancient man-made anchor out of the water...which could date back to 2500 BC (5,000 years ago!!).  😳  This was SERIOUSLY a dream come true...  So...did we REALLY find conclusive evidence that this advanced ancient city existed?!   I'm not allowed to say much about the episode until it airs...so to find out...you'll have to tune in (along with 1.5 million other viewers) on June 7th to the Travel Channel and watch Expedition Unknown. (I'm going to be on TV!!  😝 )  In the meantime...check out this little teaser video Josh and I recorded in Dwarka. (the real trailer will be out in a few weeks)  And lastly - Most people thought I was crazy when I started this...and sometimes you don’t really know why you’re called to do things…there is no rhyme or reason…DO NOT ignore that feeling!! Listening to your heart and following your gut on things may not always make sense to you in the moment...but the Universe always has a plan...be sure to listen and follow through.  🙏🏽  -Amish Shah  Founder of Ancient Explorers\"   # ancientexplorers   # travelchannel   # expeditionunknown Lina Martha",

Ive listened to most of the bulletproof episodes, so many great ones... well, this just may be the best. #413 is truly enlightening, can't recommend it enough... this and of course the time Joe Rogan has interviewed Jordan Peterson, seriously perspective changing content. Check this one out, then dive into what Dr Barry is offering the world, especially the narcissistic naïve western world. Not everyone in the west is consumed by ego, some of the greatest minds, discoveries and accomplishments have emerged from the land of the, *free.
