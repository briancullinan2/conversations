I'm planning a light rail pub crawl in commemoration of this monumental occasion, and this is an interest check.   \n\nMy goal is to have as many people as possible to stop at as many stops as possible and have one single drink at every stop we get off of the light rail.  Myself and a few dedicated friends are considering starting very early in the day to see if we can have a drink at every stop on the route, but that is by no means required to participate. Feel free to join us at one stop or as many as you can handle if you please.  Also, if you have friends that you think would be fun to bring, invite them! As this is the first real birthday I've had in 5 years, I want it to be as epic as possible.\n\nIf you can all be so kind as to let me know if you're available, interested, etc. I would greatly appreciate it.  I'm in the planning stages as far as which stops to concentrate on if we cannot hit them all, and that would be very helpful.\n\nThanks for your time, and I hope to see you all there.\n\n"
