        "description": "Susie Robertshaw From a friend who knows what's up, some advice for those interested in effective protest:  From a high-level staffer for a Senator:  There are two things that all Democrats [NB: Democrats and/or all decent human beings] should be doing all the time right now, and they're by far the most important things. [If you want to share this, please copy and paste so it goes beyond our mutual friends.]  --> You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.  1. The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time - if they have townhalls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you're in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \"mobile offices\" that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson's website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.  2. But, those in-person events don't happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.  You should make 6 calls a day: 2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.  The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story - but even then it's not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).  Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They're also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it's a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it's often closer to 11-1, and that's recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven't.  So, when you call:  A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you're calling about (\"Hi, I'd like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\") - local offices won't always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don't, that's ok - ask for their name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don't leave a message (unless the office doesn't pick up at all - then you can...but it's better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).  B) Give them your zip code. They won't always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they'll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.  C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. \"I voted for you in the last election and I'm worried/happy/whatever\" or \"I'm a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,\" or \"as a single mother\" or \"as a white, middle class woman,\" or whatever.  D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don't go down a whole list - they're figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn't really matter - even if there's not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It's important that they just keep getting calls.  E) Be clear on what you want - \"I'm disappointed that the Senator...\" or \"I want to thank the Senator for their vote on...\" or \"I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because...\" Don't leave any ambiguity.  F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you - it doesn't matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they're really sick of you, they'll be gone in 6 weeks.  From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don't worry about it - there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural. Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P ‚Äì Politician. An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc...) which makes it really easy to click down the list each day. Susie",

        "description": "Macbeth Studio Our latest video provides a look at  Fleet Farming 's new service: home garden installations.  Fleet Farming is a non-profit program that is dedicated to transforming lawns into farms. You may have heard about their farmlette program, where homeowners donate their lawn so that Fleet Farmers can maintain a garden and harvest veggies to sell (and also share them with the host)‚Äîbut there's a wait list for this program and it doesn't extend to every neighborhood in Orlando yet.  If you live in the City of Orlando and would like to grow your own food, Fleet Farming offers the service of setting up a garden in your yard and teaching you how to maintain it.

Research existing organizations in your community.  2. Listen to existing organizers in your community.  3. Give us your money.  4. Get your friends together. Give us their money.  5. Give us your time.  6. Get your friends together. Give us their time.  7. Do NOT: get lists of people whose names you don't know from your buddies without anyone's permission, email those people telling them that it's an URGENT MEETING because we NEED TO BUILD BRIDGES and we should ALL COME OUT TOMORROW so you can show us how to save ourselves when you haven't explained who you are, and no one has ever heard of you, and we have no idea why we should trust you or waste our very precious time and energy on you.  h/t Chuck Kaufman for the idea of publishing this very important guide.",

Just repaired at Ken's Bike & Ski, it boasts a brand new front tire, two new tubes, a new chain, a new seat AND a bell! Its tires have held air through this winter and all the temperature changes, which is pretty impressive.   It's a perfect bike for Davis commuting with its back rack for toting all your goodies. It also has pegs on the back for when your friend needs a lift  üòÑ  The price has been reduced to just cover the repairs done - it's a great bike, but we need the space!!",

Just repaired at Ken's Bike & Ski, it boasts a brand new front tire, two new tubes, a new chain, a new seat AND a bell! Its tires have held air through this winter and all the temperature changes, which is pretty impressive.   It's a perfect bike for Davis commuting with its back rack for toting all your goodies. It also has pegs on the back for when your friend needs a lift  üòÑ  The price has been reduced to just cover the repairs done - it's a great bike, but we need the space!!",

Last minute hurricane prep included running (gasp! I know!  I actually ran!) a half mile (halfway to work) to do animal care.   We probably don't even need to evacuate at this point, but we already brought all of our supplies there, so we're going.   There is also a pool there, so fun for the kids for today.     Expect to see some awesome collages.  Jennifer   Patty   Donnelly  I'll let everybody know we're safe as soon as I can.  It shouldn't be too bad for us here, but the west coast will get hit really hard.     :(           If ANYBODY needs help after the storm (or pet food/supplies) let me know and I'll do whatever I can to help.",

Hello Everyone, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary for me to stress the disaster that has happened in Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria. CNN described it as ‚ÄúApocalyptic Conditions‚Äù, others as a humanitarian crisis, yet without a doubt it is one of the greatest challenges Puerto Rico has had to face in years. While I am confident that we will come back stronger, PUERTO RICO NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT.  As an agronomist, I feel the pain of all of those who lost their crops and their life investments in hopes to make agriculture a way to impulse the Puerto Rican economy and as a path to have a more sustainable food system.

WHAT WE NEED AND HOW YOU CAN HELP:  ---Option A‚ÄîFriends in the USA-- I am starting a seeds collection effort \"Seeds that Feed\" as a way to aid other seed distribution relief efforts in Puerto Rico....We need CLEAN, DISEASE FREE Seeds! I will be collecting these and bringing them to the different community groups that will be providing the seeds to the farmers in need. Please gather and send seeds of the following crops:  Arugula (rocket)  Asian Greens  Beans   Beets--all types  Bell Peppers  Bok Choi   Cabbage  Chilli Peppers  Cilantro  Cucumber  Cover Crops  Eggplant (aubergine)  Kale  Lettuce  Okra  Pumpkins  Passion Fruit  Radish  Rocket (arugula)  Squash  Sweet Corn  Turnips  Zucchini  Other annual tropical crops‚Ä¶.
