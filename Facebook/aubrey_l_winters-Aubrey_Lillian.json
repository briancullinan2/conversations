You were the one who thought of it as sexual, I honestly just tried to find a photo of us after work. It might have been thoughtless, and when you said that I took the photo down in case she did find it disrespectful because I love Chase and want his relationship to work out. I just missed my friend, I do not like him in that way and I don't have a husband because he physically and emotionally amused me and cheated on me. I wouldn't ever want to hurt someone the way I was hurt.\n\n"
