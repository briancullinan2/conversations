Glad it is still going. \nMy hubby and I and a friend are going to Southern Utah July 1st to 3rd. Maybe you guys can come up and have a crazy cook out in one of the national parks \n\nWe are planning on start from zion's, which is only a couple of hours away from Flagstaff. It is going to be really fun hiking/camping if you guys can make it. \n\nXiangmiao ^o^\n"
