Obviously the medical bills are stacking up in the meantime, so if you can please help out by donating whatever you feel is in your heart. Even $5 (which is a starbucks coffee) would go a long way.

In addition, the result of last night's election broke the status quo of a a career politician in the White House. President-elect Donald Trump can only do poorly if we the people allow politicians in Washington to keep running a corrupt and power hungry agenda. So, if you don't like it, it is your job to get more involved with your country, state, and local politics. This is not an excuse to give up and throw in the towel, but to finally come together again as a country that is not only FOR THE PEOPLE but once again BY THE PEOPLE.  PS: I did not vote for Hillary or Trump, but I am an American. I was born free and I will be damned if I don't die free. This is a democracy, but it only works if WE THE PEOPLE keep it that way.   # usa   # election",

Her oxygen level dropped dangerously and it affected her heart.  Paula  and I had just arrived in Denver and yesterday we were getting ready to celebrate  Jason 's birthday when my brother Rob called and told me about Mom and that he was taking her to the ER. With Mom's condition, we knew it was serious so we had to cut our vacation plans short.  We drove all night to get back home this morning. Mom is in critical care at Mayo. She is doing a little better today but still many unknowns. She's the strongest woman I have ever known and she will pull through. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers. Thanks all. Rick Waldrip",
