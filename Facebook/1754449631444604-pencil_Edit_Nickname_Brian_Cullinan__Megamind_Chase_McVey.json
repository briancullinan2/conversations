Erika and Jake's wedding is right around the corner, and I'd like to do something nice for them. I am contacting several of their mutual friends to create a short compilation video of well wishes from those who will not be there to celebrate their wedding. \n\nIf you could please record a short video (about a minute or less) wishing them luck and love, and whatever else you'd like to say, that would be wonderful!! You can record it on your phone or laptop and e-mail it to Clairenorbut@gmail.com. I will compile the video messages and play it at Erika's bridal shower (I'll make sure Jake gets to see it as well). \n\n\nRemember this is a SURPRISE!!!! SHHH!!\n\n\nThanks!\n"
