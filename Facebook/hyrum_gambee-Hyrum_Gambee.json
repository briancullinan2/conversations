I'm actually still in school to become a journeyman electrician. 4 yrs in now. Living in Las Vegas where i moved after i left phoenix. That is really great that you went through with the computer thing. I actually thought that is what you be doing just from what i remember from us hanging out at your house as kids. Nice to hear you and john still in contact. You 3 are the only ones i remember from phoenix and the last time that i  visited i got to see john but even that was a long time ago. You guys still talking to sage and have you found yourself a good girl yet?\n"
