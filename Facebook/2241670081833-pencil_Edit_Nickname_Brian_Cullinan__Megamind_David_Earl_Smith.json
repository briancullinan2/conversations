I want to gauge commitment.\n\nAirfare: from phoenix to honolulu, oahu: $393 via hawaiin airlines\nCampsite: http://www.hawaiistateparks.org/parks/oahu/malaekahana.cfm $18 a night for 6 people. Running water, showers, beach camping. It's on the north shore, which is safer. But there is a degree of risk.\n\nTransportation: there's a bus system that goes all around the entire island, including the campsite. $2.00-$2.50 a pop.\n\nGroceries are about 2-3 times as expensive but eating out is about the same, 6-7 $.\n\nPlease let me know your level of commitment\nHawaii State Parks > Parks > Oahu > Malaekahana State Recreation Area\nLocation: Off Kamehameha Highway (Highway 83), Malaekahana Beach: Kalanai Point Section 0.6 mile north of La'ie town; Kahuku Section 1.3 miles north of La'ie town.\nhawaiistateparks.org\n"
