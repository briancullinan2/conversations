You company looks like you are on to something with hiring.  I have 2 questions that I believe can lead to the perfect candidates for every position:\n1: \"What is your ambition or hobbies outside of work\"\n2: \"Do you have any questions about our company\"\nI believing having this simple conversation can lead to the right answers from a candidate.  Staffing takes way too long, and I look forward to hearing back from you.  If you have a need for an experienced software developer, I would love to meet for lunch.  Thank you!",
