There is a super-secret place that Heather and I know of, and lake Ashurst will be the backup plan.  If there is any better suggestions, reply soon.  Otherwise, we will assume lake Ashurst.  I will post the final location tomorrow morning on this event.  I would like to get a group out to the campgrounds mid-day to claim a spot, then everyone else can join after work.  Feel free to call me for further collaboration, 928-315-1123.\n"

Take Hwy 180 towards Snowbowl.  After mile marker 225 turn Right on to Forrest Service Road 151.  Take the dirt road exactly 6.2 miles and turn Right on to Bismark Trail.  Go 1/4 Mile to a Mile and camping clearings are on the right.\n\n"
