Your experience at Swiftpage and Charles Schwab as a Senior Software Engineer is very solid.\n\nThe team is very interested in getting to know you and your background. I was wondering if you might be open to an informational chat. I would welcome an opportunity to get acquainted and create an opportunity for you to connect with folks here.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.
