Condemnation? Think back over your day. Did you criticize your coworker? Snap at your spouse? Scoff at something your neighbor did? Swear at someone in traffic? How can we preach acceptance, tolerance & love when we can't practice it individually for any length of time? We're ALL guilty of it.

Right now there is a growing chasm between the number of available foster families and the increasing number of children who enter the child welfare system because one or both of their parents are drug addicts. Please watch this short video to learn more about the problem and about why one foster mom chose to get involved. Then, visit  www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/FosterFamilies  to learn more about how you can become a foster parent in Ohio. Allen Willow Performing Arts Academy Becky Sprague",

So when he told me that sometimes he drives their boat out on beautiful days to meet her after a long day--where the highway bridge crosses over the lake, I just smiled. She's an angel and deserves a floating water chariot at sunset ... every ... single ... day.  <3",

This girl came to her rescue ... a student with no money, yet overflowing with love, compassion and determination. She scooped her up, started a Go Fund Me account to cover the dog's many medical expenses, and then--serendipitously--met a Veterinarian who just happened to specialize in the surgery that the dog needed. A special bond was formed. A second chance was given.  I believe that no good deed goes unnoticed, and that every kindness toward another creature is cause for a loving smile from our creator.   <3",

She is one of my strongest spiritual mentors and just an all-around-amazing soul. She was a youth minister, has led countless retreats and is more in touch with the Holy Spirit than most people I know. Maybe I'm biased. But maybe I'm not. Her writings always inspire reflection.  <3",

Still one of my favorites  ❤️ Mary Brown Szymkowiak  ·  October 5, 2016  ·  “More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.”   ~Alfred Lord Tennyson (1845)    I heard this quote a few times today, in a podcast I listened t ... o ... again and again, because it was resonating. Funny how God serves up what you most need to hear when you most need to hear it. The quote is a great reminder that--even when you're feeling like a tiny echo in a limitless universe--you are EVERYTHING to the One that matters most. And all things are possible through Him. (This  # 365Photo  wasn't taken today -- but it's one of my favorites for so, so many reasons. Mostly because this little one is a miracle baby. And i completely and unabashedly believe in Miracles. )  <3   # faith   See More",

And I've never known anyone whose name describes them more than hers does ... Joy. She's always smiling. Always optimistic. And she always hides her burdens, choosing instead to focus on the good. So when he told me that sometimes he drives their boat out on beautiful days to meet her after a long day--where the highway bridge crosses over the lake, I just smiled. She's an angel and deserves a floating water chariot at sunset ... every ... single ... day.  <3",

This girl came to her rescue ... a student with no money, yet overflowing with love, compassion and determination. She scooped her up, started a Go Fund Me account to cover the dog's many medical expenses, and then--serendipitously--met a Veterinarian who just happened to specialize in the surgery that the dog needed. A special bond was formed. A second chance was given.  I believe that no good deed goes unnoticed, and that every kindness toward another creature is cause for a loving smile from our creator.   <3",

        "description": "Mary Brown Szymkowiak  shared a memory. Our sweet girl (and my napping buddy)  ❤️ Mary Brown Szymkowiak  ·  November 6, 2015  ·  \"We couldn't have picked a better dog,\" he says frequently. Truth is, I think she picked us. She just jumped up in his lap at the pet store, batted her long eye ... lashes and suddenly she was on the way home with us. She takes her job as Neighborhood Squirrel Patrol VERY seriously, stalking like a cat. When we walk her, people often drive by... slow down...and smile after one look at her short legs, red coat, and solid body. [Or maybe they're noting the similarities between us girls? Hmmm.] We've learned to speak Corgi around here ... recognizing the focused, in-your-face-stare that means \"time for my outdoor rounds.\" Or the side look that means, \"Get ready. It's time to engage in some Kamikaze Corgi play.\"  She's my loud, obstinate, camera shy, brown-eyed girl. And I look forward to spending time with her every day  :)   # 30DaysofGratitude   # Day5   See More",
