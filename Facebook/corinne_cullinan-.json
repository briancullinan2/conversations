I guess I have been avoiding having to talk about dad and I still am not really ready to.  But I know that's no reason to avoid you because I'm sure you respect that. it sucks and it hurts what he did and said. I'm sure you've heard his side of the story. I swear, he has no idea who I am, Brian. I hope you and Iga are doing good. I'd love for you guys to visit or for me to come visit you when I can. I'm trying to find work out here still, I haven't been trying my hardest but I'm kicking it into high gear now. We are only about 12 hours from each other now!! Anyway, let me know how things are going, my mom said she saw on linkedin that you got a new job? How are the pups?\n",

She's an awesome dog, I've been training her myself and I'm actually pretty good at it. Yeah, I'm not sure why he is the way he is. I just keep thinking about something he said to me a while back... that all he wants is to make the people around him happy. The thing is though is that he thinks he knows what people need/want to be happy and doesn't understand when its different than the way he sees it. It's just a lie. I went to my stepbrothers wedding in Chicago in August and it tugged on my heart the way the brides father spoke about her and it made me sad that I'll never have that. I've just been reminding myself that it's nothing I've done (even tho that's what he probably thinks and how he makes me feel sometimes), that he's just not capable of having the feelings other dads have for their children. It's not normal.\n\nI didn't know you had Aspergers. What's that like? We've had a good summer here in Denver and have gone on lots of adventures exploring the mountains. It's been so cold lately though! I was getting to be seriously unhappy in Columbus, stressed and anxious all the time. I told you I was having extreme headaches and I got an MRI to make sure I was ok. That's when I knew I needed to change my life. I thought, if I only had a few months to live or found out I was dying is this really how I'd continue my life? Life is too short and I decided to go after something bigger. I've been getting into furniture design and really want to try starting my own thing and working for myself. That would be ideal. Since coming out here though I've had no headaches due to stress or anxiety and I feel more at peace with myself. It just feels right and I thought I would miss Columbus more but I don't. I'm glad I did it instead of looking back ten or so years later wishing I had gone for it, you know?\n\nAnyway, I gotta run  I love you bro, tell Iga I say hi and love her too. Give the pups a tummy rub for me. \n",

It feels like I am on the brink of a headache all the time, like if it wasn't for drinking lots of water I would get a migraine while I'm trying to work.  It could also be one of many poisons we ingest everyday.  I hope you are eating organic, more vegetable and less meat, that it was modern nutrition tells us which is grossly different from what the FDA recommends. \nThe fresh mountain air should do you some good, as well as the beautiful hiking all around the south west.  I am glad you moved and you are closer.\nWe will come visit as soon as you are ready, and you're always welcome out here.\nAs for the family stuff, Iga and I realized if you can't have the family you want, you can make your own!  It's still just talk though.\nJimbo will never be the nurturing father, and my mother is just as bad, she's overweight and watches a lot of TV and bullshit news.  They have no better list of priorities than anyone else.  Which is sad because millennials can't prioritize either.\nIf I had to put it in order it would be 1) God, 2) Food, fresh water, sleep 3) Wifey 4) Father, mother, family.  5) Work.  But I am sure I mix up that order all the time.\nThis is what living with Asperger's is like:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/megamindbc/posts/10102142130066248\nLiving with Asperger's is like having no ability to determine the quality of the conversation you are having. Unless someone is completely, almost blatantly rude about what they think of you, there is no understanding of emotional interaction.\nBrian Cullinan\n",
