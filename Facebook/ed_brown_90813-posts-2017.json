        "description": "Michael Dorsey When I️ was a young man. Our government was ran by people of character and cooperation was the tool and lubricant that made government to work. Our elected fought to get the best for our people.   Today we send characters to Washington. Cooperation is a dirty word. Sides are drawn and winning is more important than actually serving the people.  Discusting to think of all who sacrificed their time, blood and lives defending our country for it to come to this. Disgusting to see the way Congress is moving to serve a few that own them and not the people that elect them. Discussing to see that someone like Roy Moore is the best a state like Alabama can find and with the recent coming forth of multiple violated he is still their guy.   I point a finger at the politicians and the system but the real sour spot is the people. The people that support this kind of candidate and the system that encourages winning over electing the best person for the job. We one elected people with character not characters. Michael Dorsey",
