I am happy last night's election went well for them, The GOP across our nation needs to be checked...with that said, that does not mean that I will support dems in the future....If you vote blindly you are part of the problem because you will condone DNC/RNC corruption and their lack of commitment to their promises. You will never hold them accountable and you will continue to feed evil as long as it isn't \"as\" evil....              Our politicians should be held accountable for everything they do and everything they vote for. They should be held accountable for their corporate ties and their corruptions....but you continue to be content with the status quo.... you continue to vote for corporate welfare, war and inequality across all demographic lines.... you send YOUR kids to those wars to kill and watch YOUR loved ones come home in body bags or shattered from war because some old  rich bigot thought up this war that killed/shattered them to generate money....          The blood of thousands is on the hands of those who vote for it, condone it and those who chant for war, yet they are to coward to go themselves.... people who vote blindly  or vote party lines are afraid of a fight, a revolution so you do as little as possible to not make waves.... that is why you vote for \"the lesser of two evils\".... gtfoh with that bull shit.... grow some balls and take up a real fight....fuck the DNC, fuck the RNC and fuck all of those party line supporters, those who are easily fear mongered out of a vote.... those who are for leaving our government unchecked and able to run a muck with no consequences ....I have always challenged authority, I always will....
