Just sharing::   Recently one of my customers rejected to buy one of my Mac Machines when I already invested 4K to purchase from sellers.  I feel cheated since all my effort and time was wasted.,Since all my machines I will inspect and do the performance upgrade for free.  For 2 months my money was locked down and doing nothing. The machine in hand was put on hold for almost 2 months and then finally rejected.  With heavy heart I commenced today and hoped for the best and did what I do  best.  Stay calm , Contact more people and \"told myself : it's only business nothing personal\"  With help of Lord JujuApamanji , I manage to sell 2 Macbooks , 1 gamer Razer Headset and 1 Macbook Pro 15 inch retina ,Top End\" in 24 hours.  Yes , I build my machines with Love and care since I love building machines and it's a gift I learn over years.  I didn't make profit since BDS is still a hobby of mine and my main source of income comes elsewhere. But I do it happily because I love what I do and supplying good machines to users is my ultimate goal.  Laptops and electronics are the window to the world. Respect it , us it wisely to gain intellectual and profit.  If you don't respect your machines , don't even think of coming up in life.  jk",

        "description": "Jean Seeland  added  2 new photos . Where Do you Think all the Gold and Platinum Came from ?  For the first time, scientists have caught two neutron stars in the act of colliding, revealing that these strange smashups are the source of heavy elements such as gold and platinum.  The discovery, announced Monday at a news conference and in scientific reports written by some 3,500 researchers, solves a long-standing mystery about the origin of these heavy elements ‚Äî which are found in everything from wedding rings to cellphones to nuclear weapons.  It's also a dramatic demonstration of how astrophysics is being transformed by humanity's newfound ability to detect gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time that are created when massive objects spin around each other and finally collide.  The collision, known as a kilonova, rattled the galaxy in which it happened 130 million light-years from here in the southern constellation of Hydra, and sent fireworks across the universe. On Aug. 17, the event set off sensors in space and on Earth, as well as producing a loud chirp in antennas designed to study ripples in the cosmic fabric. It sent astronomers stampeding to their telescopes, in hopes of answering one of the long-sought mysteries of the universe.  Such explosions, astronomers have long suspected, produced many of the heavier elements in the universe, including precious metals like gold, silver and uranium. All the atoms in your wedding band, in the pharaoh‚Äôs treasures and the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and still threaten us all, so the story goes, have been formed in cosmic gong shows that reverberated across the heavens.

Most common in inline four-cylinder engines, which, due to their design asymmetry, have an inherent \"Second Order Vibration\" (vibrating at twice the engine RPM) that cannot be eliminated no matter how well the internal components are balanced.   This vibration is generated because the movement of the connecting rods in an even-firing order four-cylinder inline engine is not symmetrical throughout the crankshaft rotation.   2.4 Liter Engine emits more vibration than 2.0 Liter Engines. So to counter this phenomenon engine builders prefer to make 2.0 Liter engine with Higher compression ratio and Turbocharged to extract more power out of it.  Meanwhile 1.8 or lesser engines are less powerful to pull 1.5 tonne cars.  This is the Engineering reason behind selecting 2.0 Liter Turbocharged Engine.   Subaru made Opposed engine to counter this effect.   jk.",

Grateful people aren‚Äôt angry and they don‚Äôt see them as victims.   Nowadays humans  are getting less grateful because people are being told they are entitled for things and benefit that they didn‚Äôt earn.   So don‚Äôt teach your Children they are the victims of racism or treated as second class citizen.  Teach them they need to earn entitlement , prospect and luxury in life.   JK.",
