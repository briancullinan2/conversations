I had an issue with my MacBook and had to reinstall my operating system. The bad part is that I didn't get a chance to backup the music that was on iTunes.  Do you know anyone that can help me transfer my music from my phone back to my computer so I don't lose it all?\n\n\nThanks,\nAndrew\n"

The guy just told me to Google it and I should be able to find something.\n\nThat's great to hear about your wedding!  Congrats and yeah, maybe we can meet up one day\n\n"
