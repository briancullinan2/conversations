        "description": "Tagging folks I think might be interested in participating. If you are interested, LIKE OR COMMENT even if I didn't tag you. If you're not, move along.  :)    I'm doing a new playthrough of Darkest Dungeon with you guys naming my characters. I'll draw a name at random using the site I used for the XCOM 2 playthrough.    For those unaware, Darkest Dungeon is a dark, Lovecraftian,  turn-based RPG where c ... haracters can die permanently. Fighting skeletons, fish men, and other horrors affects the mental state of your party members causing them to behave irrationally, become paranoid, and even suffer straight up heart attacks.    These experiences can cause your characters to develop positive and negative quirks, like being really good at killing fish men or prone to stealing items from the party.    The game autosaves constantly, so there's no going back on mistakes or character deaths.    New characters arrive after every quest. Any time I get a new character, I'll draw one of your names.    I will attempt to stream the playthrough. I'll also be posting updates on how everyone's heroes are doing here on Facebook. I'll tag everyone who is participating so you guys don't miss any.    Here's the rules I'll be setting for myself:    - Reynauld and Dismas, the two characters you always start with, will not be customized and MUST survive to the end of the game because I want the Achievement for doing so. If one of them dies, the playthrough is over.    - The difficulty will be Bloodmoon. This is the hardest difficulty and includes the Crimson Court expansion, which I've only briefly experienced. It adds vampires and a new class.    - The playthrough must be completed in 99 in-game weeks. Each quest undertaken is a week. This is for another Achievement.    - I will have a few mods installed. Some just add new cosmetic skins to the existing classes. The others add 5 new classes: The Witcher(!), the Onabushi, the Ronin, the Falconer, and the Conquistador. As far as I can tell from experimenting with some of them and reading forums, they're all balanced. If I find this not to be the case, the unbalanced character will be removed and whoever named them will go back into the drawing.    If you're still reading, you're probably interested in going on this adventure with me. Great! Make sure you like or comment so I know to put you in the drawing.   See More",

        "description": "Ivan Kelly Seth on Finding Peace:  You form whatever reality that you know. You have always done this. The heaven and hell that you think of, this is your own experience, the consequences of your actions. There is in some distant, ultimate time, a returning to that from which you have come. But when you return to that from which you have come, when you return to what you think of as God, by then new creativity will have already begun, consciousness will evolve in new ways and there will be new challenges.  There is no end. This does not mean that there is no peace, for peace is within you now. If you would but realize it, it is within you. It is closer to you than breath. It is closer to you than your own pulse. It is as close to you as you are. You are co-creators.  What you call God is the sum of all consciousness and yet the whole is more than the sum of its parts. God is more than the sum of all personalities, and yet all personalities is what He is. There is constant creation, but peace is to be found in creation. There is a force within you that allows you to breathe. There is a force within you that knew how to grow you from a fetus to a grown adult. This force is part of the innate knowledge within all consciousness and it is a part of the God within you.  The responsibility for your life and your world is indeed yours. It has not been forced upon you by some outside agency. You form your own dreams and you form your own physical reality.  I told Ruburt (Jane) today that God has given you the greatest of all gifts and the most awesome. He has given you what you want. The world is what you want as individuals and as races. The world is what you are. You look at the state of the world and you find the physical materialization of the inner selves which have formed it. You look at nature and you find the joy that is within you that you have also formed outward. You look at the good and it is a reflection of the good that is within you, within each individual person, multiplied outward millions of times for each individual within the planet. And there is no man that hates but that hatred is reflected outward and made physical. And there is no man that loves but that that love is reflected outward and made physical.   I want you to realize that you as you understand yourselves to be, your individuality, is not changed by this. I have had this same personality with some minor changes throughout the ages, and you are stuck with yours as I am stuck with mine. All the abilities that I have now I have always had. And you have abilities that you are not using, you see, and the sooner you learn to use them the better it will be for you. I want you to realize that while I no longer inhabit your physical system, the human personality that is mine and thus has filled many physical forms, still exists. I am still learning. I still have work to do and you will still have work to do. You will set challenges for yourselves.  There is a short time between lives when you rest and when you take stock of what you have learned and where you are. But true peace is within you now. And if you do not realize it, it is not because peace does not exist. It is because you have closed yourselves off from peace, and joy springs out of peace.  Joy cannot come from unease and dissatisfaction.  You will not find peace after this unless you know peace within yourselves now. The kingdom of peace is not on some planet, not four blocks down and three blocks across, not a million light years away and miraculously will you find it. The kingdom of peace is within each of you now and if you realize this, then indeed you dwell in peace and from peace comes your security and confidence and joy.  ~ Seth (Jane Roberts), 'The Early Class Sessions'; ESP Class March 12, 1968.

        "description": "Abe Pralle Farewell Louise Hay.  <3   https://www.mindbodygreen.com/…/louise-hay-passes-away-at-90  From Wikipedia via Ivan Kelly:  \"You Can Heal Your Life\"  You Can Heal Your Life is 1984 self-help and New Thought book by Louise L. Hay. It was the second book by the author, after Heal your Body which she wrote at age 60. After Louise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Donahue in the same week in March 1988, the book landed on the New York Times Best Seller list and by 2008 over 35 million copies worldwide had been sold, in over in 30 languages. The book was also instrumental in the success of her publishing company, Hay House Inc. Today, due to the book, she is \"one of the best-selling authors in history\", and one of largest selling women authors, after J. K. Rowling, Danielle Steel and Barbara Cartland.  The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body somehow have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself with eliminating symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve what she perceives as the mental root causes of disease. Hay believes that the causes of \"dis-ease\" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, and postulates that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as \"mirror work\" and affirmations.  At the end of the book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and various emotional thought patterns that Hay believes causes them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, Heal Your Body, which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979.

        "description": "Julie Austin Photography Duke!  What a guy.  Nothing gets in his way despite being blind.   I had a great time meeting him at yesterday's  Old Dog Haven  picnic.  Here is more about Duke... ...  Duke (Marmaduke) is a Min Pin with cropped ears and tail. At 12 years old, he was adopted out of the shelter twice and brought back both times due to uncontrolled “accidents”, before they figured out he was diabetic. At this point, he was brought into the Final Refuge branch of the ODH family. Duke was like a walking skeleton, he was so thin and quite depressed from diabetes and being in the shelter. However, he felt comfortable within the first 4 hours of entering his ODH home. He is Very Busy. He must know what is going on all the time. The worst thing in his life are his twice daily diabetic shots. His favorite things are meals, which he manages even without teeth – thus the protruding tongue, and chasing the cat. His diabetes is under better control now but he still has to go outside about 10 times a day and wear a belly band inside. You’d never know he was 12 by the way he acts. He happily trots outside in all kinds of weather to take care of business with the other dogs in the house and comes out of a deep sleep in a split second at the sound of someone crossing the room, or a rabies tag clanging against a cat collar. Our vet and his ODH family continue to work on regulating his diabetes and getting him back up to a good weight and we hope he’ll have lots more fun months ahead.   See More",

        "description": "Julie Austin Photography Sweet Mojo was one of the attendees at yesterday's  Old Dog Haven  picnic.  Mojo is a Final Refuge dog who lives with my friend Bev Bowe.    What is a Final Refuge Dog?  Here is more about them from the Old Dog Haven website, which is  www.olddoghaven.org ...  Final Refuge (permanent foster) dogs are spending the last part of their lives as members of the family in one of our wonderful ODH homes, surrounded by people who love them, with excellent medical care.   They have been deemed unadoptable due to health issues, too fragile to move again, or very close to the end of their lives.  These dogs are being supported in their retirement homes by your donations. Thank you!  Here is more about dear Mojo!  Mojo ended up at a shelter at age 14, after being passed around among friends and neighbors. The shelter vet told us he needed a dental and had a heart murmur. When he arrived, we found a big murmur, an old rib fracture, a very sore face from terrible teeth, and many disc problems in his back – the curse of this breed. We removed many teeth and he saw a cardiologist and had an ultrasound. Since then Mojo has had recurrent episodes of GI upset, recurrent bladder infections, and recurrent episodes of back pain. Each time he responds very well to medical treatment and just keeps going with a cheery, tough-guy attitude.  We don’t know quite how long this feisty little fellow will hold off all those chronic problems but he’s very welcome in his ODH home as long as he is comfortable.   See More",

        "description": "Hannah Pralle Several people at this fire have assumed that my coworker is my husband, and they seem confused that that bothers me. Someone else recently assumed that my other fire trucking employer must be my ex. Quite a few men have seemed concerned that I would put the wrong fuel in their vehicle, or not understand that it's important not to, whereas they assume my male coworker knows what he's doing. There has been a lot of man-splaining, and one incident of a man actually using baby talk with me. And that's just from the last two weeks! I'm definitely not in the habit of accumulating sexist–related grievances, but this article my brother  Abe Pralle  shared really hit home because it is so pervasive, this is such a big part of my reality and it's not something that most men seem to understand, but I know all my girlfriends do. I feel I have to manage the impressions other men are reckless in conveying about me, in the way they deal with me. I've never personally been worried about physical violence, which is obviously something this author brings up as a relevant thing for women, but it is obnoxious the way that a rejected advance can turn a man so sour and even mean. And it's like, both the advance and the sourness are things I didn't sign up for. I've been talking with my friends and acquaintances and even YouTube a lot, lately, about assertiveness, and the problems I've had in being assertive in certain kinds of situations, and this article sheds a lot of light on why I'm feeling that way, and why it's been so hard for me to verbalize, or even understand what that's about. I'll be interested to see how I feel, moving forward, with this idea of de-escalation as a lens through which I can analyze my own behavior, and the situations happening around me. Rather than this being some kind of accusatory post, I would like to thank the men in my life who have demonstrated a degree of awareness of how to negotiate both the spoken and the unspoken rules of etiquette, mutual respect, and camaraderie across the lines of gender.
