        "description": "Marc Haynes As an seven year old in about 1983, in the days before First Class Lounges at airports, I was with my grandad in Nice Airport and saw Roger Moore sitting at the departure gate, reading a paper. I told my granddad I'd just seen James Bond and asked if we could go over so I could get his autograph. My grandad had no idea who James Bond or Roger Moore were, so we walked over and he popped me in front of Roger Moore, with the words \"my grandson says you're famous. Can you sign this?\"   As charming as you'd expect, Roger asks my name and duly signs the back of my plane ticket, a fulsome note full of best wishes. I'm ecstatic, but as we head back to our seats, I glance down at the signature. It's hard to decipher it but it definitely doesn't say 'James Bond'. My grandad looks at it, half figures out it says 'Roger Moore' - I have absolutely no idea who that is, and my hearts sinks. I tell my grandad he's signed it wrong, that he's put someone else's name - so my grandad heads back to Roger Moore, holding the ticket which he's only just signed.   I remember staying by our seats and my grandad saying \"he says you've signed the wrong name. He says your name is James Bond.\" Roger Moore's face crinkled up with realisation and he beckoned me over. When I was by his knee, he leant over, looked from side to side, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said to me, \"I have to sign my name as 'Roger Moore' because otherwise...Blofeld might find out I was here.\" He asked me not to tell anyone that I'd just seen James Bond, and he thanked me for keeping his secret. I went back to our seats, my nerves absolutely jangling with delight. My grandad asked me if he'd signed 'James Bond.' No, I said. I'd got it wrong. I was working with James Bond now.  Many, many years later, I was working as a scriptwriter on a recording that involved UNICEF, and Roger Moore was doing a piece to camera as an ambassador. He was completely lovely and while the cameramen were setting up, I told him in passing the story of when I met him in Nice Airport. He was happy to hear it, and he had a chuckle and said \"Well, I don't remember but I'm glad you got to meet James Bond.\" So that was lovely.  And then he did something so brilliant. After the filming, he walked past me in the corridor, heading out to his car - but as he got level, he paused, looked both ways, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said, \"Of course I remember our meeting in Nice. But I didn't say anything in there, because those cameramen - any one of them could be working for Blofeld.\"   I was as delighted at 30 as I had been at 7. What a man. What a tremendous man.

It was part of a decades long terror campaign, which the UK endured the way the UK has endured any threat, and which America actively supported both politically and financially. And did the UK institute travel bans on the Irish? On Catholics? Did they send the SAS to the Vatican to take out the pope?  No? Well, fancy that. If you look at daesh differently than you look at the IRA, then you really should consider again your creds for racism.  --  Maggie Forest",

What you say is the absolute truth; however, one must remember that the most efficient form of government is a dictatorship. Probably, the least efficient is the democratic/republican form: the people decide.  It is combersome because it can be changed, but it has to go through a due process.  The USA as a country is not perfect as it is governed by people who are not perfect.  The Declaration of Independence was written by a brilliant man, but he was a man and was not perfect.  The Articles of Confereration were designed to give the states power over a central government.  When that did not work, the Constitution was written.  It provided a limited base for central government which could be changed by a set procedure.  The rights of the people have been gradually expanded through ammendments.  The power of the president has been expanded in times of war and crisis.  The Supreme Court has affirmed or denied many \"rights.\"  We are a nation of many different cultures.  We have denied the rights of Native Americans and Blacks, but we have tried to rectify the wrong.  Whenever a breaktrough in civil rights occurs, we have people who will fight it.  We've had a good president who denied the civil rights of a large number Americans in WWII.  I'll just say something I learned long ago about life--to divine the future, we must study the past.",

        "description": "Brian Esposito == More Unwanted Thoughts By Me on The 4th ==  As to fireworks, not only is there noise that people and animals may have trouble with, but some of us are no longer so enamored with a holiday that celebrates values which have become trampled in the last few decades, let alone with the goings on of our current Administration.  A \"free\" country that didn't free its slaves for how long? A \"Christian\" country that allowed slavery and indentured servitude, in the first place? As well as condoned the killing and displacements of entire indigenous populations? A country that didn't give women the right to vote until the 20th Century?  We're in two endless wars, and I'm not even sure what they are for, any more. Oh, wait - lithium, opium, and oil, maybe? The majority of 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, but we go to war with Iraq. Now, the neocons are pushing for war with North Korea, and Iran -- Iran, which has become much more moderate toward the West. Hey, what another generation sent off to be maimed or killed? Hey! We can thank them for their service! (Hasn't THAT become a cliche!)  In the meantime, we pull out of the Paris Climate Accords -- a symbolic gesture, because participation is voluntary, and where we step back in leadership -- be it economic, or otherwise -- Germany and China will step up, but hey, OK--until the planet's hell in a handbasket for our children and grandchildren. (Some are warning that it's already too late.)  The Confederacy lost the Civil War, and there are elements that turned that into a social war that persists to this day, because goodness forbid our schools be integrated! All lives don't matter until black lives matter, until LGBTQ lives matter, and until we have police forces which no longer have to be litigated or shamed into doing right by the constituents and communities they serve.  Did I just write constituents? What a mess the Congress has become, and that won't change until we force the big money interests out of politics, again. (GOP-you were the party of Theodore Roosevelt, who fought corporate influence a hundred years ago. I'm lookin' right at you while you laughably defend the guy you couldn't beat now in the White House.)  We can't have Sharia law, but the Evangelical Christian right wing, desperate to retain control of its slipping social influence, sponsors and passes draconian laws to control women, birth issues, and what is taught, or not taught, in our classrooms.  Look at the history, and we've done good things - even some great things - but most of them come out of the fact we messed up, first, and big time!  (First came the Declaration of Independence, and then the disastrous Articles of Confederation, which tried to give power to the thirteen states, and wasn't that a treat? So, the Constitution was written to fix that mess!)  But, hey, let's have our easy patriotism, and wave our flags and blow up stuff, and take it all for granted.  Here's the deal: we have the technology, the money, and the growing understanding to turn this planet into a paradise for nearly every one of its inhabitants. Do we have the vision? Do we have the will? One Love. Brian Esposito",

        "description": "Brian Esposito == More Unwanted Thoughts By Me on The 4th ==  As to fireworks, not only is there noise that people and animals may have trouble with, but some of us are no longer so enamored with a holiday that celebrates values which have become trampled in the last few decades, let alone with the goings on of our current Administration.  A \"free\" country that didn't free its slaves for how long? A \"Christian\" country that allowed slavery and indentured servitude, in the first place? As well as condoned the killing and displacements of entire indigenous populations? A country that didn't give women the right to vote until the 20th Century?  We're in two endless wars, and I'm not even sure what they are for, any more. Oh, wait - lithium, opium, and oil, maybe? The majority of 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, but we go to war with Iraq. Now, the neocons are pushing for war with North Korea, and Iran -- Iran, which has become much more moderate toward the West. Hey, what another generation sent off to be maimed or killed? Hey! We can thank them for their service! (Hasn't THAT become a cliche!)  In the meantime, we pull out of the Paris Climate Accords -- a symbolic gesture, because participation is voluntary, and where we step back in leadership -- be it economic, or otherwise -- Germany and China will step up, but hey, OK--until the planet's hell in a handbasket for our children and grandchildren. (Some are warning that it's already too late.)  The Confederacy lost the Civil War, and there are elements that turned that into a social war that persists to this day, because goodness forbid our schools be integrated! All lives don't matter until black lives matter, until LGBTQ lives matter, and until we have police forces which no longer have to be litigated or shamed into doing right by the constituents and communities they serve.  Did I just write constituents? What a mess the Congress has become, and that won't change until we force the big money interests out of politics, again. (GOP-you were the party of Theodore Roosevelt, who fought corporate influence a hundred years ago. I'm lookin' right at you while you laughably defend the guy you couldn't beat now in the White House.)  We can't have Sharia law, but the Evangelical Christian right wing, desperate to retain control of its slipping social influence, sponsors and passes draconian laws to control women, birth issues, and what is taught, or not taught, in our classrooms.  Look at the history, and we've done good things - even some great things - but most of them come out of the fact we messed up, first, and big time!  (First came the Declaration of Independence, and then the disastrous Articles of Confederation, which tried to give power to the thirteen states, and wasn't that a treat? So, the Constitution was written to fix that mess!)  But, hey, let's have our easy patriotism, and wave our flags and blow up stuff, and take it all for granted.  Here's the deal: we have the technology, the money, and the growing understanding to turn this planet into a paradise for nearly every one of its inhabitants. Do we have the vision? Do we have the will? One Love. Brian Esposito",

        "description": "Brian Esposito == More Unwanted Thoughts By Me on The 4th ==  As to fireworks, not only is there noise that people and animals may have trouble with, but some of us are no longer so enamored with a holiday that celebrates values which have become trampled in the last few decades, let alone with the goings on of our current Administration.  A \"free\" country that didn't free its slaves for how long? A \"Christian\" country that allowed slavery and indentured servitude, in the first place? As well as condoned the killing and displacements of entire indigenous populations? A country that didn't give women the right to vote until the 20th Century?  We're in two endless wars, and I'm not even sure what they are for, any more. Oh, wait - lithium, opium, and oil, maybe? The majority of 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, but we go to war with Iraq. Now, the neocons are pushing for war with North Korea, and Iran -- Iran, which has become much more moderate toward the West. Hey, what another generation sent off to be maimed or killed? Hey! We can thank them for their service! (Hasn't THAT become a cliche!)  In the meantime, we pull out of the Paris Climate Accords -- a symbolic gesture, because participation is voluntary, and where we step back in leadership -- be it economic, or otherwise -- Germany and China will step up, but hey, OK--until the planet's hell in a handbasket for our children and grandchildren. (Some are warning that it's already too late.)  The Confederacy lost the Civil War, and there are elements that turned that into a social war that persists to this day, because goodness forbid our schools be integrated! All lives don't matter until black lives matter, until LGBTQ lives matter, and until we have police forces which no longer have to be litigated or shamed into doing right by the constituents and communities they serve.  Did I just write constituents? What a mess the Congress has become, and that won't change until we force the big money interests out of politics, again. (GOP-you were the party of Theodore Roosevelt, who fought corporate influence a hundred years ago. I'm lookin' right at you while you laughably defend the guy you couldn't beat now in the White House.)  We can't have Sharia law, but the Evangelical Christian right wing, desperate to retain control of its slipping social influence, sponsors and passes draconian laws to control women, birth issues, and what is taught, or not taught, in our classrooms.  Look at the history, and we've done good things - even some great things - but most of them come out of the fact we messed up, first, and big time!  (First came the Declaration of Independence, and then the disastrous Articles of Confederation, which tried to give power to the thirteen states, and wasn't that a treat? So, the Constitution was written to fix that mess!)  But, hey, let's have our easy patriotism, and wave our flags and blow up stuff, and take it all for granted.  Here's the deal: we have the technology, the money, and the growing understanding to turn this planet into a paradise for nearly every one of its inhabitants. Do we have the vision? Do we have the will? One Love. Brian Esposito",

        "description": "Shala Kerrigan A lot of fannish people have their One True Thing- that fandom that formed who they were as people, who helped them form their life philosophy. That one book, show or movie that was just everything.  For my daughter, in 2005, when she watched the first episode of the Doctor Who reboot, it was that magic moment.   It was everything. It was the idea of someone who wasn't always nice, but always tried to do the right thing, it was someone who was hurt, but dedicated to healing others. It was someone who had a screwdriver to fix what was broken, it was EVERYTHING.  Almost. Except it was a male.   But then there was the 10th Doctor. And that's who she wanted to be. She never ever wanted to be a Companion, she wanted to be the Doctor.   Now- here's the thing, she was already experimenting with her own gender fluidity. But this was the moment for her. This man, this Doctor, she never wanted to be the sidekick, the Companion. She wanted to be the hero, the one who fixed, healed and saved.   She wore suits and Chucks and started a collection of sonic screwdrivers. She fully embraced her own gender fluidity. Her disregard for those lines and cages of expectations. She had no interest in gender-bending the character.   Ever since then, part of her regular wardrobe is Doctor related. Darn near part of her daily wardrobe has something to do with her One True Thing.   This is why I'm so thrilled. Because I'm thinking off all the young women who aren't gender fluid, who are happily cis-gendered, because this busts down one of those expectations. This breaks a limitation.   This says \"You can be the hero, you can be the fixer, you can be the healer.\"  The Companions have been breaking down limitations and barriers since the reboot. Starting with a working class girl who lived in a small flat and had no great ambition, the black woman doctor, the overweight, dumped at the alter redhead, the young black man, the lesbian, the omnisexual immortal, the Companion roles have been so very inclusive.  But the main role- that hasn't been. Don't misunderstand, in my heart- Peter Capaldi IS my Doctor and always will be and has been from the very first moment he was on screen.   But this Doctor- she will be the Doctor for a generation.   She might even inspire a little boy to grow his hair out to and embrace his own feminine side.   Do you know how much representation matters? How much it matters in those universes? To know that we can be the hero?   That we see ourselves as the heroes, that we see people in wheelchairs, or older people, or people of color, or people with breasts as the hero?   We NEED that. And those people who have gotten to know all their lives that they can be the hero need to know that too, that being white and male doesn't confer a special, unique ability to be heroic and good.   So, if you see a lot of people who are talking about this today and you get really sick of it, just try to remember- this character means a lot of things to a lot of people and this moment right now is huge to a lot of us.   # RepresentationMatters",

        "description": "Bryant Hileman Imagine if the people who championed outdated social norms because they really believe it's the culprit for societies problems all stopped and spent 1% of that energy on actually improving the lives of other human beings by rolling up their sleeves and getting to work.   It would have a far greater impact on society than forcing your own unique interpretations of spirituality and morality on others.   Your outrage about naked breasts or naughty words on television doesn't feed hungry kids.   Your pearl clutching fainting about gender roles doesn't stop violence against women.   Your finger wagging and scolding doesn't adopt a child.  I believe your heart hurts from these things, but it's easier to pretend to be outraged about unwed mothers or alcohol sales on Sunday than putting your money and sweat where your mouth is.  You do this for yourself, to make yourself feel better the easiest way possible. That's why that noise is the loudest, and gets the most attention. That's why the rants posted fighting equality for supposed moral reasons are the longest from the same people who sit on their hands while the world burns.  I'm not a religious man, but I work with a lot of good people who are. I respect them because they are honest in their intentions, are respectful of others views, and they are willing to work with anyone to shape a better world. They believe it.  Believe whatever you want, but if you don't have actions to back up your hand wringing, I can't take you seriously. You only do it to make yourself feel better. It's selfish. Bryant Hileman",

If the latter, please check the safety authenticity of viewing glasses to ensure they meet basic proper safety viewing standards.  Eclipse viewing glasses and handheld solar viewers should meet all the following criteria:      Have certification information with a designated ISO 12312-2 international standard      Have the manufacturer‚Äôs name and address printed somewhere on the product      Not be used if they are older than three years, or have scratched or wrinkled lenses      Not use homemade filters or be substituted for with ordinary sunglasses -- not even very dark ones -- because they are not safe for looking directly at the Sun.
