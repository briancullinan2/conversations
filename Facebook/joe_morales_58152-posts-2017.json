For those of you who know my journey, I love you. Keep praying and keep believing with me. Thank you for everything.  For any of my friends struggling with life, keeping up the facade, suffocating under the weight of 'how it's supposed to be' or wandering aimlessly in black void of depression, keep going, keep pushing, stand your ground and turn your eyes. God can do more than you can ever think or ask.   Listen.",
