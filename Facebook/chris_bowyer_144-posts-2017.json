        "description": "Wayne Challeen Comment from another thread. About why Berners really don’t care or think the FB ads from Russia matter much. She’s right on.  I think it's because Sanders supporters saw actual rigging. We saw actual voters disenfranchised. Actual voter fraud. Actual election fraud coming from members of our own party. We saw Bill Clinton stumping illegally IN an election place. Actual millions paid into CTR for internet trolling with misinformation. Actual lies about our candidate on the news only to discover these were all deliberate. We saw collusion between party leaders and the media to a degree we didn't realize existsed, and like you said, it always has. But knowing those things threw our election makes it so that the Russian interference seems to pale in comparison. In fact, the general election was a fraud to start considering the cheating in the primary. And lastly, our DNC members and the media colluded in such a way as to deliberately elevate Trump so that Clinton had less competition and we know that.  ~ Dawn Noelle Richard Piltz",
