I’d like to offer you our free Fruit of the Spirit devotional, which you can download here: http://bit.ly/FamilyDevotional\n\nIn Galatians, Paul invites us to ask the Spirit to transform our lives with the gifts of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. This devotional includes nine devotions featuring movies that demonstrate the virtues Paul instructs us to develop.\n\nAlong with a link to watch each movie, you will find thoughts on how the characters and plot can help you open your heart to the Holy Spirit and transform your life. You can enjoy the devotional in several ways, including as a personal devotional, or as a family night activity. \nI hope you find this beneficial. Cheers to wholesome entertainment!\nGod Bless,\nGreg\n",
