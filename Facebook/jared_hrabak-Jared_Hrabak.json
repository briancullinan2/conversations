Not sure what all the iPhone supports, but I know it's similar.  If you are doing that, you should find a platform development kit that can put your app on all mobile platforms.  Also, it would be unwise to seek out lots of profit, there isn't a whole lot of money in apps unless you have something completely original and incredibly useful.\n"
