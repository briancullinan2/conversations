Legislators are now openly calling for online services to suppress rebellious voices, right there on the Senate floor.  Excerpt:  Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii demanded, for her part, that the companies adopt a “mission statement” expressing their commitment “to prevent the fomenting of discord.”  ...  Clint Watts, a former U.S. Army officer, former FBI agent, and member of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, made the following apocalyptic proclamation: “Civil wars don’t start with gunshots, they start with words. America’s war with itself has already begun. We all must act now on the social media battlefield to quell information rebellions that can quickly lead to violent confrontations and easily transform us into the Divided States of America.”  He added, “Stopping the false information artillery barrage landing on social media users comes only when those outlets distributing bogus stories are silenced—silence the guns and the barrage will end.”   # Orwell   # Censorship",

        "description": "Frederick Murphy Excerpt from the article:  \"Brazile’s melodramatic “oh I was so grief stricken” admission that Clinton had taken over DNC operations long before becoming the party nominee is just the latest in a long series of revelations confirming things Berners have been saying for over a year now while being dismissed as conspiracy theorists by Democratic party loyalists.  This is coming straight off the back of Twitter’s admission that it hid half of all  # DNCLeaks  mentions in the leadup to the general election despite the fact that only two percent were considered to have come from suspicious accounts. As The Young Turks’ Michael Tracey rightly notes, people who pointed out at the time that tweets with this hashtag seemed to be hidden from view by Twitter admin “were called conspiracy freaks”. The American people were trying to communicate with each other about a very real thing that had been revealed about their democratic process, and Twitter actively worked to prevent them from doing so.\"   # ConspiracyFact   # DonnaBrazile   # DNC",

The Manhattan attack has forced a rare occurrence in which the made-up boogeymen of both mainstream partisan hack franchises are overlapping just enough for a few people to experience some dissonance and maybe get some insight into how fucking ridiculous they look all the time. Not many will, but a few might. I’ll take it.  Meanwhile, the nationless plutocracy which has loosely centralized its operations in the United States has created so much economic injustice that two-thirds of Americans would struggle to cover a crisis that cost $1,000 while depriving the nation’s citizens of social safety nets granted to everyone else in every other major country on earth, destroying the ecosystem with psychotic neoliberal deregulation and expansion, bombing countries all over the world that most Americans couldn’t find on a map, ramping up an increasingly militarized police state and Orwellian surveillance programs, and brainwashing the nation with establishment propaganda to convince them that this is all normal.  But yeah. Muslims and Putin, boooo, scary.\"   # ManhattanAttack   # Islam   # terrorism   # oligarchy",
