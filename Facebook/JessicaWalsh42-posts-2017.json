The leading cause is not drugs, violence, bereavement or mental health but \"the loss of a private tenancy\", simply not making the rent - and by implication the destruction of state housing and state support via welfare. London boroughs have the highest homelessness, with Newham recording one in 25 people as homeless, whilst 10 miles to West houses stand empty, held by absentee investors.  This  ... is the truth of the wealthiest city in the wealthiest part of the wealthiest country in Europe after Germany, and the fifth richest country in the world.   This is the truth behind measuring that is measuring the status of society purely by wealth, purely by our GDP. The Gross Domestic Product of an economy that increasingly produces nothing. We sell sales, we finance financiers, and our country is apparently rich. Because the figures look good. The figures that now sleep in doorways, or don't sleep at all worrying their nights away in temporary beds, on borrowed time.   How long until we stop playing along with the lie of \"financial growth\" and \"healthy economies\"?    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41889923   See More",

The leading cause is not drugs, violence, bereavement or mental health but \"the loss of a private tenancy\", simply not making the rent - and by implication the destruction of state housing and state support via welfare. London boroughs have the highest homelessness, with Newham recording one in 25 people as homeless, whilst 10 miles to West houses stand empty, held by absentee investors.  This  ... is the truth of the wealthiest city in the wealthiest part of the wealthiest country in Europe after Germany, and the fifth richest country in the world.   This is the truth behind measuring that is measuring the status of society purely by wealth, purely by our GDP. The Gross Domestic Product of an economy that increasingly produces nothing. We sell sales, we finance financiers, and our country is apparently rich. Because the figures look good. The figures that now sleep in doorways, or don't sleep at all worrying their nights away in temporary beds, on borrowed time.   How long until we stop playing along with the lie of \"financial growth\" and \"healthy economies\"?    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41889923   See More",

The leading cause is not drugs, violence, bereavement or mental health but \"the loss of a private tenancy\", simply not making the rent - and by implication the destruction of state housing and state support via welfare. London boroughs have the highest homelessness, with Newham recording one in 25 people as homeless, whilst 10 miles to West houses stand empty, held by absentee investors.  This  ... is the truth of the wealthiest city in the wealthiest part of the wealthiest country in Europe after Germany, and the fifth richest country in the world.   This is the truth behind measuring that is measuring the status of society purely by wealth, purely by our GDP. The Gross Domestic Product of an economy that increasingly produces nothing. We sell sales, we finance financiers, and our country is apparently rich. Because the figures look good. The figures that now sleep in doorways, or don't sleep at all worrying their nights away in temporary beds, on borrowed time.   How long until we stop playing along with the lie of \"financial growth\" and \"healthy economies\"?    http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41889923   See More",

        "description": "Jessica Walsh I had another weird dream last night so I thought I'd write down what I remember.   The main character was a subpar MI5 agent who never seemed to do anything right. He couldn't even remember to keep state secrets haha. In retrospect he kind of reminds of of Adam Sandler if he had a British accent, so from here on I'll call him Adam. ^^  So Adam is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at this prestigious hotel. I know they're in Saudi Arabia, but it looks more like Latin America or possibly the Mediterranean. For one thing the climate seems more tropical than what I'd have expected, and furthermore I can't recall any of the women being covered up, even with hijabs.   Anyway Adam is standing on a balcony looking over an outdoor restaurant. He is watching four men in light blue robes talking at a picnic table. Three of them are Saudi princes, and the fourth is former US President Barack Obama. Suddenly they all get out of their seats, Obama makes some joke causing them all to laugh, and then they walk away.  Adam begins to follow them but is unable to determine where they went. Instead he runs into a colleague of his, a woman in a black dress who is none other than Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the first lady of Canada. They seem to know each other, leading me to believe that Sophie is also a British spy, and quite a better one than Adam at that.  The two are unable to find Obama and the princes, but they do end up sitting together with a pair of men who look like they're from the Middle East, but sound like they're Italian mafia men. Sophie is playing her part and being nice to the men, but Adam can't help but immediately reveal his identity. He says he's trying to get promoted to James Bond's job(which is a real thing in this universe), and reveals that contrary to popular belief, it's not an easy gig with fifty weeks off a year that the Queen assigns people to when they want to keep them out of trouble. Sophie shakes her head.  A few hours later, Adam is alone in the back of a limo along with one of these Middle Eastern mafia men who I will call Franco. The two are discussing a possible partnership, likely because Adam's loose lips were mistaken for a willingness to defect. Franco then reveals an upcoming plan that they're about to carry out. I can't remember what it was, but Adam recognizes it as bad and knows he has to stop it.  Later that night Adam is in his compound, which looks a lot like the Apple Store. He is wearing a black jumpsuit now and traveling down to the garage via a large see-through elevator. Upon arriving, he sees two large vehicles(one of which I swear is the Batmobile), but what startles him the most is Sophie standing there, also in a black jumpsuit.   She explains to him that the last few years spying on Justin had been fantastic, but that she had really missed going on \"real\" missions. She had been reminded of that that day when she was with Adam, and now she was prepared to trade in her hot husband for a new life of espionage. The two hopped in the Batmobile and were off!  ...and I woke up! I really hope I get to see what happens next. But I probably won't. xD",

This is shocking to me...though at least the 90 year old Canadian agrees with me, which makes me think it might be a cultural thing. One difference I've always noticed between Canada and the US is the latter's segregation of races(no longer enforced by law of course, but still evident in practice) that is practically unheard of in Canada. Perhaps the same thing is true for sex. =O",

This is shocking to me...though at least the 90 year old Canadian agrees with me, which makes me think it might be a cultural thing. One difference I've always noticed between Canada and the US is the latter's segregation of races(no longer enforced by law of course, but still evident in practice) that is practically unheard of in Canada. Perhaps the same thing is true for sex. =O",

        "description": "Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion Feeling lean today - finally back on track after a very stressful 3 weeks. I haven’t discussed it here on my page as to be honest I was just blindsided by what happened, in shock and traumatised. On October the 5th, a legal journalist invaded into a Tribunal (civil) case that I rightfully won, up until that moment, I presumed it was private. Fair Trading told me to take the matter to NCAT, and not to worry about having a lawyer present, as I was more likely to win if I represented myself, so I was not advised that the matter may become public.. I pleaded with the journalist not to write a story on my private court matter and she said “well I am anyway, it’s an interesting story” HEARTLESS, and then cleverly chose an angle that discredited & demeaned me, which brought about widespread hatred  😔 . The story went viral around the world. I received emails & social media messages from journalists in 7 other countries, it was in every paper and on every main TV channel here In Australia. I couldn’t sleep, lost my appetite, couldn’t work, couldn’t function. I had a panic attack and ended up in hospital 😔 . I have been sexually harassed by thousands of men, abused, shunned in my local area, even my neighbours are judging me, received 2 death threats, disgusting emails & social media messages from some truly horrible people, it’s been traumatic 😔 . it has also negatively impacted upon my thriving business, which turns 6 today, given my business is online and my potential clients are strangers, and this story was seen by millions of people, who now think I am a bad person.  This all happened because I dared to stand up for myself when this business who was found to have used deceptive conduct, refused to refund me in December 2016! I’m appalled by the lack of protection there are for consumers and I’m determined to make my awful experience a catalyst for change.   The way the media vilified me, using a misogynistic-angled story, and in doing so, leading the public to believe I was somehow in the wrong, so they attacked me, is unacceptable. I’ve experienced bullying my entire life- but I have learned to stand up to it- and I’m standing up to this!   I’m a very caring and decent human being - and they have tarnished my good reputation on such a large scale. It would mean the world to me if you can all help by sharing the posts & pics of mine you find inspiring to you - that will help me more than you know  😊 ❤️ .  Thank you for supporting me  ❤️ .   # truth   Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion  xx   Zoë Daly   <3 Beaudry Benedito Matthew Keele Robbie Poncho Mike Dominique Adrian Marani Patrick Tony Garcia Leo Valentin Sergio Aaron Xavier Zoë Daly David Jonathan",

        "description": "Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion Hi everyone!!  😊  A few years ago I posted about a topic I'm deeply passionate about, and now it's time to post about it again as the issue is FAR more prevalent these days.  Although it doesn't offend me anymore, I still get tired of seeing comments like \"that's not sexy\" or \"you've got no boobs\" on my images. You know what? I'm not trying to look 'sexy'! And So What if I'm natural-chested? These comments are being made by those who are clearly expecting me to just take loads o ... f selfies in G-Strings (\"  # gluteprogress  \") or with cleavage showing/just nipples covered).. That seems to have become what is considered 'normal' for fitness models. Really disappointing to say the least.  --  If being 'sexy' was my aim, it would not be hard to acheive. But it's not! I'm a FITNESS MODEL. I live and breath the healthy, fit lifestyle. I also have morals and self respect, so I only post images related to my lifestyle- aka health & fitness. Sure, I can be 'sexy'. Everyone on the face of this planet can be. But to me, that's a private thing- reserved for the special person in my life. It's not the image I want to portray to the entire world. Call me old fashioned - I call it class. It actually saddens me that SO many girls feel the need to exploit themselves in order to get noticed 😔 .  --  Personally, that's not the type of attention I want. I just wish the line between the fitness industry was not so blurred with the porn industry. Sex & fitness are not the same thing.   I really hope things change because the pornification of social media/our culture in general, really has gone too far.  --  Much love to you all,  NAMASTE 🙌🏼   Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion  xx   Zoë Daly      # sorrynotsorry   # fitnessmodel   # abs   # lean   # shredded   # inspo   # fitspo   # instafit   # fitfam   # healthy   # onlinecoach   # inspire   # goals    # bossbabe   # physique   # aesthetics   # chicksthatlift   # wbffpro   # aestheticsarmy   # ripped   # fitnessmotivation   # fitnessaddict  Thank you to  PixelfitNess Photography    MU: MakeupByHeather   See More Sean",

        "description": "Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion If I had a dollar, or even 1 cent, for every time I've been asked how many Ab crunches I did a day, I'd be set for life! 💰 Truth is- the answer is ZERO. I've never really done them. My strong core is the result of  functional exercise my entire life- with all the power coming from my core 💥 .  To help strengthen your deep core muscles; your Transverse Abdominus (TVA) and Pelvic Floor, you cannot go past Pilates 🙌🏼  Im a huge fan and have been doing it since 2006. What Pilates will t ... each you is the correct breathing technique to engage these deep core muscles, so you effectively use your core not only in the gym, but day-to-day life. Gym-based Ab exercises generally only hit the outer core muscles (Rectus Abdominus), which is still great to train- but without a strong & functional inner core, you're at risk of injury & you won't reach your aesthetic potential either.  --  Once you've mastered the correct breathing technique and core engagement, you're on your way- however the next step in revealing a defined mid section, is your nutrition. A diet solely made up from whole foods, with the right macro ratios, will help you achieve an optimal body fat level, so your abs will come through  👌🏼 Some people may store more body fat through the abs due to genetics, stress levels and other life circumstances- but no matter what- with persistence to a healthy lifestyle- everyone can have defined abs  🙏🏼  --  Hopefully my post helps a few people reach their Ab goals! ☺️  --  Have an amazing day everyone!  😊 😘 🤗 😎 😚 🙂 😀 😄 😃 😆 😁   Zoë Daly Fitness Model Champion  xx   See More",

I don't think I had that kind of strength a few years ago... I wanted life to always be happy and couldn't cope when things went wrong.. But after the past 3 tough years (all the injuries and chronic stress) and a recent attack from a cold hearted and desperate journalist here in Sydney, who invaded into my private life, I have been through my hardest week y ... et.. I have been harassed, abused, so much undeserved hate... it knocked me down  :(  but I am through it and I am STRONGER than EVER!   Thank you to our haters- they are our motivators!  To feel severe pain every day: physical, emotional and spiritual- yet still manage to move through it and find happiness, is what I call strength.

Beyond proud of my gorgeous online client Bree @brianaharitos  👏🏼  This is 28 weeks of commitment to my program - pure hard work and determination! Bree has dropped a total of 21kg, and 25cm from her waist in just 8 months- what an achievement!! I'm so freaking happy for her- she's looking sensational  👌🏼 💪🏼 .  What's super exciting is she just stepped on stage on the weekend @ the ICN NSW State Championships!! 👙 🎉 .  --  My coaching is about looking after my clients horm ... ones and metabolic rates- their health is my number 1 priority 🙏🏼 . Too often you hear horror stories of how people have been starved and given hours of endless cardio every day to lean up- only to end up exhausted, their thyroid production down-regulated, hormonal imbalance and loss of lean muscle tissue. That is NOT how it should be. My clients eat a healthy amount of calories, enjoy weekly cheat meals, fruit every day, rest days and round the clock support: and in return they reach physique goals but also become healthier and happier. That's how it should be  ☺️ 🙏🏼 .  I truly love what I do, it makes my heart happy ☺️  - I'm so grateful to my amazing clients for allowing me to be a part of their journeys!

        "description": "Jessica Walsh I had another weird dream last night so I thought I'd write down what I remember.   The main character was a subpar MI5 agent who never seemed to do anything right. He couldn't even remember to keep state secrets haha. In retrospect he kind of reminds of of Adam Sandler if he had a British accent, so from here on I'll call him Adam. ^^  So Adam is in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at this prestigious hotel. I know they're in Saudi Arabia, but it looks more like Latin America or possibly the Mediterranean. For one thing the climate seems more tropical than what I'd have expected, and furthermore I can't recall any of the women being covered up, even with hijabs.   Anyway Adam is standing on a balcony looking over an outdoor restaurant. He is watching four men in light blue robes talking at a picnic table. Three of them are Saudi princes, and the fourth is former US President Barack Obama. Suddenly they all get out of their seats, Obama makes some joke causing them all to laugh, and then they walk away.  Adam begins to follow them but is unable to determine where they went. Instead he runs into a colleague of his, a woman in a black dress who is none other than Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the first lady of Canada. They seem to know each other, leading me to believe that Sophie is also a British spy, and quite a better one than Adam at that.  The two are unable to find Obama and the princes, but they do end up sitting together with a pair of men who look like they're from the Middle East, but sound like they're Italian mafia men. Sophie is playing her part and being nice to the men, but Adam can't help but immediately reveal his identity. He says he's trying to get promoted to James Bond's job(which is a real thing in this universe), and reveals that contrary to popular belief, it's not an easy gig with fifty weeks off a year that the Queen assigns people to when they want to keep them out of trouble. Sophie shakes her head.  A few hours later, Adam is alone in the back of a limo along with one of these Middle Eastern mafia men who I will call Franco. The two are discussing a possible partnership, likely because Adam's loose lips were mistaken for a willingness to defect. Franco then reveals an upcoming plan that they're about to carry out. I can't remember what it was, but Adam recognizes it as bad and knows he has to stop it.  Later that night Adam is in his compound, which looks a lot like the Apple Store. He is wearing a black jumpsuit now and traveling down to the garage via a large see-through elevator. Upon arriving, he sees two large vehicles(one of which I swear is the Batmobile), but what startles him the most is Sophie standing there, also in a black jumpsuit.   She explains to him that the last few years spying on Justin had been fantastic, but that she had really missed going on \"real\" missions. She had been reminded of that that day when she was with Adam, and now she was prepared to trade in her hot husband for a new life of espionage. The two hopped in the Batmobile and were off!  ...and I woke up! I really hope I get to see what happens next. But I probably won't. xD",
