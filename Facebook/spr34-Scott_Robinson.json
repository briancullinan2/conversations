Are you familiar with the benefits/drawbacks of both systems?  Costs?  If so, is there a time we can meet up, maybe over lunch, and discuss this?\n\nThanks,\nScott Robinson\n\n858-449-3074\n\n"

Digital is generally more expensive, but supports a lot of different types of signals, including HD.  I should be able to help you find the information you need.  I will be free after work today and tomorrow, we could meet up at Lumberyard or something for a beer if you like.  I will have my internet enabled phone, but you may want to use a laptop to look up information.\n\nShoot me a text or something to confirm,\nBrian Cullinan\n\n614-425-6054\n"
