I'm not content with the path that Hillary Clinton will lead us down it's not worth it even if Donald Trump does get elected president . You people think that I don't understand what's at stake here I'm very well educated on American democracy and how the government works I understand there is Supreme Court nominees up for nomination I understand that the nuclear missiles are at stake. I also understand that we cannot continue to go down the path that we are going on it's like seeing the ice were right in front of us and not trying to steer the ship. . This country is an absolute disgrace we are not number one in anything but military spending and prison population. . Some of us are not content with corporate America and the path that Hillary Clinton and the oligarchy will take us down. Our country is literally falling down and she is profiting from the fall , we need to restore American democracy because we may never have another chance the system is already so rude and uncontrolled you don't understand how much power they really have over us and how much can be taken away from us at any time .  # NeverHillary   # Refugees   # HillaryClinton   # BernieSanders   # BirdieSanders   # Tonedownforwhat   # Feelthebern",

When she decided to skirt the question \"Is Bernie Sanders qualified to be president\" three fucking times, she did herself in. She always does stupid shit like this. \"Of course Senator Obama's a Christian, as far as I know.\" Remember that gem 8 years ago?   She's getting pissed, and pissed=stupid. She can't win on the issues so she's going the petty route like she always does when she's in trouble. The oven is pre-heated and she's too stupid to see that her political future is the main course.  # FeeltheBern   # NoMercy Ken https://www.facebook.com/jedigiamo/videos/665554099354/?pnref=story 02:06 65,991 Views Joseph Di Giaimo  ·  April 7, 2016  ·  BREAKING NEWS  #BernieSanders  💚  #thankYOU  💙 ...  #TONEdownFORwhat  #theREALdeal   See More Dan Hettmannsperger III",

        "description": "Daniel Hettmannsperger III  is with  David Lemmo  and  86 others . THE DOOM OF HILLARY CLINTON.  I've personally been called a sexist, a liar, a \"Berniebro\" and a long list of other insults and slanders I won't repeat here. My problem with Hillary is not based on her gender or on Fox News right wing rants. My dislike of her is rooted in facts.   ~ 12 FBI agents are investigating her. That alone should have killed her candidacy. Media bias and the DNC have shielded her.  ~ Her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches simply proves that she has something to hide. She's not even president yet and she's already pulling Nixon-shit with us.  ~ Her various disasters with Haiti, Libya and the South China Sea mark her as a terrible secretary of state.  ~ Her completely unconvincing claims to care about the LGBT community,  # BlackLivesMatter  and the poor...claims which have zero evidence to support them.  Trump will use all of this and more.  He will be as unmerciful and savage as he's been his entire life and she won't survive it. Her endless humiliations and excuses will destroy the Democratic party for at least a generation. It's either Sanders or suicide. What's it going to be Hillary supporters?  # BernieOrBust Michael Cristi Haiser Julie Kowalski Phyllis Kate Leone https://www.facebook.com/michelle.bush.507/posts/10208406653740206 Louis Farrakhan on Hillary Clinton 03:53 610,291 Views Jocularly Like Page  ·  April 21, 2016  ·  Louis Farrakhan on Hillary Clinton    www.facebook.com/mcallout",

Time to abandon ship and unite behind a banner that actually stands for everything we believe in. Bernie was the last hope for Progressivism in the Democratic Party, but the DNC refused to allow us to choose the Democratic nominee for ourselves. Now we must repay their betrayal with exodus, and unite behind the Jill Stein and the Green Party, who have been waiting for us with open arms since the DNC's sabotage became apparent.",

How can we help the Natives? You can help right now Green Party People.   Billionaires are billionaires because we keep giving them our dollars. They get their money from us !!! Do you want the oil industry and big corporations to feel your voice right now today and tomorrow, this whole week. They will notice quickly. It would only take days for them to feel the effect. Please Join the Revolution and strike. Sit down with your family and discuss these ideas.  1.Do not drive your vehicle anywhere unless you need to. Stay home as much as possible.   2. Do not purchase processed food or food in plastic containers or drinks in plastic containers. Not unless you have to. You can buy stainless steel or aluminum water containers and take your own water to work. You don't have to drink water from a plastic bottle.   3. Do not eat out. Not unless you're eating at a privately owned Family Restaurant. Do not visit corporate restaurants. Try to eat at home. If you work... pack a lunch.   4. Do not buy Plastic Products, cut back. please.   5. Shut your lights off. Unplug appliances when they are not being used. Cut back.   6. Shut the television off unless you're watching it. If you really want to go gun ho' do not watch any news stations on your television and promote their ratings. Shut your TV off and get your news from your phone. Real Truthful transparent news cant be heard on television anyway.   7. If you live down south or out west start a garden. Grow some of your own vegetables. It's probably too late now if you live in the north but you can consider it next year.  8. Stop at those fruit and vegetable stands that you see on the side of the roads. Shop there. Give those people your money.   9. If at all possible purchase as many organic food items as you can afford.   10. Whatever groups revolutions strikes athletes you support, let them know that your family is supporting them and what they believe in.   11. Dedicate yourself to making 5-10 phone calls every single day and 5-10 emails everyday. You can call/email your local government your state government and your federal government to make complaints. Make a list of those phone numbers and email addresses for your friends and family and post them.   12. When you speak out make sure you speak louder and further. Make sure everything that you speak and post is correct information and the truth. Add more friends to your Facebook.   13. Take white shoe polish and write #nodapl on your vehicles. If you support a Green Party candidate get their sticker on your car. Make the same signs and put them on the outside of your homes. #cleanenergy theres lots of hashtags you can display. #nomorewar #youcantdrinkoil It's always good to use a hashtag on your signs so that people can go there and find more support and knowledge.   Great Consciousness comes in waves.   Be the wave and don't be afraid.   We are 99%.   May peace truth and knowledge find all of us.",

I was so busy today that I didn't take a single photo of my own, but based on my Facebook feed, it looks like Museum [for a day] was thoroughly documented by its 1,500+ attendees!  I'll echo  Kevin 's sentiments below. I had the honor and privilege to sign off on an earned Railroading merit badge today, give group guided tours to over 70 people, and share the message of railroad preservation with an interested and eager general public.  Any way you measure the success of an event, whether it be by attendance, earnings, or exposure, I think the URHS knocked this one out of the park. We had a professional appearance and attitude that made a really positive impact on visitors, and great fun was had by all!  Thanks so much to all of the volunteers, donors, and suppliers that made Museum [for a day] so successful! Kevin Phalon Rudy Garbely Matt Phalon",

I'll use this photo to sum up today: Every one of these stubs represents a person who we brought into today's \"Railroad Museum [for a day]\", an event that I have had the privilege to be the Chairman of over the last 11 weeks... Over 1500 people came in and out of our location that is open to the public one day per year. To put that in perspective, this was at capacity for our train yard. Not a single exhibit didn't have a line of at least a dozen people throughout the 7 hour day. Street parking was nowhere to be found, and every shuttle bus showed up full. We had it all: locals, people who came from states away, families, kids, seniors, college students, photographers, hipsters, railroaders.   A day like today proves that historic preservation is not only alive, but can be appreciated by anyone, as long as you can present it in an accessible, enjoyable, and educational way. That was our goal when  Rudy Garbely  and I set off on this insane and incredible project in July, and I have no reservations in calling it a 100% success.  Thank you so much to everyone who came out to support us today. I have never seen so many people from so many different aspects of my life in one place. I'm proud to have the work I appreciated by people I care about!",

I'm not going to say goodbye to some of you because I believe in your rights to your property (Facebook Post) is like putting up a sign on your front lawn......However, now I'm watching the ones who will have the time to read this post until the end. This is a little test, just to see who reads and who shares without reading! If you have read everything, select \"like\" so I can put a thank you on your profile! Cancer is very invasive and destructive to your body. After you have finished your treatment, then, your body wants to go to war with yourself trying to reconstruct all the damage caused by radiation. It's a very long process.  Please, in honor of someone who died, or is fighting cancer, or even had cancer, copy and paste.  They all say: \"if you need anything, do not hesitate, I'm gonna be there for you\"... so I'm going to make a bet that less than 1/2 of my friends put this on your wall. You just have to copy (not share)!!!  I want to know who I can count on.... Write \"done\" in the comment when you do.  To all those who are fighting... I am with you. Praying for the courage and strength of those fighting the fight.",
