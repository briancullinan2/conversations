Since my last update Kenji put up concrete board and built a half wall for the shower. We ordered tile and that came in. Yesterday we headed to Lewiston for the right piece for our shower drain and today Kenji installed the \"quick pitch\" shower kit and filled/leveled it with mortar. I am so excited for progress  :)",

There is a competition going on at NAU at the moment. And as far as I can understand a team (from a school?) creates one robot. Then their robots are teamed up with two other robots from other groups. The robots are suppose to work together to \"attack\" a tower. But I'm not sure what are the scoring rules.",

The Whitman County Auditor’s Office counted another roughly 600 vote by mail ballots from last week’s election today.  That brought the number of ballots from the City of Pullman to about 3,900 which is enough to validate the vote.  Proposition 1 has passed with 63% approval.  The 10.5 million dollar bond will be used primaril ... y to relocate city hall to the Encounter Ministries campus on Pioneer Hill.  Other funds from the bond will purchase land for a 3rd fire station and provide full funding for the long planned for Lawson Gardens House.  The validation also means that prop 2 has passed.  The 2.4 million dollar bond will be spent on park and path improvements.  That issue has passed with 73% of the vote.  There are still about 500 ballots countywide left to tabulate.  The Auditor’s Office will run another batch on Thursday.   See More",

        "description": "Pullman Radio News Race for a Pullman City Council seat gets tighter, Albion Town Council race tied again  November 14, 2017 Evan Ellis News  A race for an Albion Town Council seat is tied once again.  Crystle Morgan and Bruce Kenoyer both have 53 votes.  They were tied on election night before Morgan took a one vote lead late last week.  In Pullman Dan Records leads Garren Shannon by 3 votes for city council.  Records lead was at 10 votes after the last round of tabulation.  In Uniontown Ray Hei ... tstuman now leads Steve Kelly for a town council seat by one vote.  The men were tied at the last count on Thursday.  Jason Fletcher leads Alyssa Heagy by 3 votes in Tekoa for city council.  And in Rosalia Bob Hill leads Janet Strohl by 4 votes for city council.  None of the other contested race leaders have changed from election night. The Farmington street levy is still being rejected after barely passing on election night.  All other small taxing district levies in Whitman County are continuing to pass.  The Whitman County Auditor’s Office still has about 500 ballots left to count.  They will run another batch on Thursday.   See More",

The Whitman County Auditor’s Office counted another roughly 600 vote by mail ballots from last week’s election today.  That brought the number of ballots from the City of Pullman to about 3,900 which is enough to validate the vote.  Proposition 1 has passed with 63% approval.  The 10.5 million dollar bond will be used primaril ... y to relocate city hall to the Encounter Ministries campus on Pioneer Hill.  Other funds from the bond will purchase land for a 3rd fire station and provide full funding for the long planned for Lawson Gardens House.  The validation also means that prop 2 has passed.  The 2.4 million dollar bond will be spent on park and path improvements.  That issue has passed with 73% of the vote.  There are still about 500 ballots countywide left to tabulate.  The Auditor’s Office will run another batch on Thursday.   See More",

Not quite my favorite this year, Doctor Strange holds that title so far, but I haven't seen Moana yet. HOWEVER. To quote  Kenji  after Force Awakens last year, \"I have some problems.\"  Aside from the Star Wars canon issues (to echo  Chris D - RIP Kyle Katarn, 1995-2016), which I can mostly deal with, there's a few plot issues, particularly what happens at the very end. No spoilers. My two big beefs though- the movie uses some cliches that frequently make me facepalm- again, can't go into into it without spoilers- and while the characters were likable enough, there wasn't enough time to build up a connection with so many of them. And once again, I can't go into more detail without entering major spoiler territory.   The movie did a few other things well- it definitely feels like Star Wars, Darth Vader is as badass as ever, and the production team did an amazing job digitally inserting Peter Cushing (as Tarkin, you may recall him from A New Hope) into the movie- you could tell he was computer generated, but he fit much better than CBS's budget job of digitally inserting Jack Lord into the season premiere of Hawaii Five-0 a couple months ago (points if you understand what the hell I'm even talking about).   Overall, a good movie, with some issues, and a decent addition to the Star Wars universe.",

It was truly a group effort....Uncle Pat did a perfect ceremony, Aunt Connie did the amazing bouquets and flowers, Colleen was a great last minute Maid-of-honor, Liz and Jen helped me stay calm and happy  😜 , Brittnay gave CD the best hair cut of his life on the lanai looking at the ocean and my hair looked beautiful as well...and everyone else, Mahalo from the bottoms of our hearts!!!  💕 💕 💕 💕 😎  and of course a HUGE thanks to my parents!! My mom is my rock and couldn't have done any of it without her, I'm truly blessed to have you as a mom and help me grow into the woman I am today!!  😍  And of course my dad, he's the strongest man I know with the biggest heart in the world...I'm one lucky gal to have such terrific parents!!!  💕 💕 😊  here's some of our sneak peak photos (it was so hard to choice which ones to post 😜  I love them all already)...more to come!!",

        "description": "Chris Sheridan  is with  Bonnie Sheridan  and  Joe Sheridan . It's about 2 years since I announced I'd be leaving SEL. Since then... a lot has changed. I think I've grown more in these 2 years through the choices I made than I would have had I remained at SEL. Even with how much people like  Grant ,  Kenji ,  Carrie ,  Huma , and  Ahsan  could have taught me it's nothing compared to how far out of my comfort zone I went, and what I learned while out of my comfort zone.  Now, I have true confidence in that I know how to test things. With a sample size of 1 company and 1 development group it was hard to extrapolate a strong confidence from the small sample. Now I've worked at 3 companies, with everything from any resource I wanted to half a desk and a laptop. Each challenge I've been dropped in to I've received the feedback of that not only do I do the job well, but I push others to do the job well.  I still miss my friends at SEL, I miss the friends I made at IdentityMind ( Derek  is the only one I can tag), and I miss having my family just an hour (or less) away. Always wondering (at least a little) if the people that I trained have continued to excel or if that's just something I tell myself to erase doubt in my choices.  As I take a moment to look back, I know that I've made some lifelong friendships, even if they just stay on Facebook, and when the question is asked \"Was it worth it?\" I can answer confidently that as I turn to the future the answer is yes.  I'm looking forward to this next year at Gogo where I will continue to push myself, and those around me to ensure we release the best damn products possible. Just like before, I will also make new friends like  Amanda  while I'm at Gogo.  So, this is just a quick moment to thank my friends and co-workers from the past, and the future. You have all made work fun. Also thank you Mom & Dad for supporting me in my move away from the Inland Northwest. This would have been much harder emotionally without that support.  In case anyone's wondering, I am perfectly okay. I just tend to get a bit more retrospective between Matt's birthday and my own. Especially with each May recently having a surprise announcement of a new job (don't worry Gogo, I'm sticking around). Work and home were a little to busy to process things, and it's all coming out in this novel of a post. (Congrats if you read all the way to here.)",
