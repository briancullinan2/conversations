        "description": "Wanda Marie Worsley For the past 4+ years,  Steve  and I have been trying to have a baby- obviously without any luck. The past 2 months we've been seeing fertility specialists and are working on a treatment plan. After tests, and exams, and more tests, we finally had our final pre-treatment consultation. Letrozole and IUI are the plan for now, and with any luck 2016 will be year of the baby. If not, we'll play it by ear and see what our options are and if we're willing to invest financially and emotionally into IVF (as it is the doctor explained our current plan will run $600-900 per cycle, as infertility treatment isn't covered by insurance in all but a handful of states that force them to). The next few months will be a rollercoaster for us, but as scary and exciting, and especially scary as this is, I didn't want to keep it a secret. 1 in 8 couples experience fertility issues, and we have no idea what this road hold for us ahead, but it's got to be easier to take it together than alone. For now, we wait, and chart, and take pills, and injections, and visit the doctor for more tests, and we hope. We appreciate if you hope for us too, and we'll share information as we can and feel comfortable to  <3 .",

Steve  and I are leaving tomorrow and staying near Washington Square. To see as many people as I can I wanted to pick a spot and hang out for a few hours so people can stop and hang out wherever. Sunday(Tomorrow) we'll be at  Ava Roasteria  @ 4655 SW Hall Blvd, Beaverton from 3pm to 6pm; come say hi and have a cup of coffee and relax a bit from the holiday insanity  ♥  Again, I know not everyone is free that day, and if we didn't have such limited time to be down here I'd go visit everyone.",

        "description": "Wanda Marie Worsley  was  feeling drained with  Steve Worsley . Fertility Update- bear with me cause it's a long one.   Since starting fertility treatments last fall, Steve and I have done 5 IUIs (Intra Uterine Insemination) and none have been successful. We were fortunate enough to get pregnant on our first IUI, but had an early miscarriage, and every month since has continued to fail to implant. At this point, IUI isn't really a reasonable option, as its not circumventing the issues preventing us from conceiving. We were recommended to try IVF where they harvest a large quantity of eggs, fertilize them in the lab, and after 3-4 days of development, the best ones are transplanted into the uterus in hopes of them attaching and making it to delivery. It involves a lot of medications and daily office visits for monitoring, and we would gladly do it all if it didn't START at $13,000.  Yeah, $13k. FOR ONE CYCLE- given what we know based on my age, ovarian reserve, and response to treatments so far, my specialist put me in the top tier for success, which is 50% rate. Meaning, most likely 2 treatments, which brings us closer to $20,000 if we're lucky and able to harvest all the eggs for multiple cycles at once.....   but it could be 3, or 4, or never. There are a handful of states that require insurance to cover fertility care, including IVF, we don't live in one of them and Steve's work isn't based in of them. So we'd have to pay full price, out of pocket. I've learned, not surprisingly, there are a myriad of companies that specialize in “fertility loans”, which sets up for great comedic lines “6 more payments and the baby is ours!”, but in reality would be the heaviest noose we could ever place around our necks. That's a small car loan, IF WE'RE LUCKY. But what if we're not? What if we aren't able to have a child even after IVF? Then we have a bill every month that just reminds us of the losses and emptiness. It also means we can't even consider moving or buying a house this year, or really do anything for a very long time. I've been so angry and upset the last two weeks, knowing that the next step we need to take is right there, but its behind a red velvet rope. It feels like fertility blackmail.   Steve and I have talked for a long time, as we've been trying to have a family for over 5 years now, about what we would do if we can't. We can accept it, and we can live a happy and loving life together without having children, but IVF is the last piece in that puzzle to give us a yes or no, to determine if we're a couple, or something more, and it's out of reach because of asinine health care costs and non-comprehensive insurance. I have looked and found that some companies, regardless of their legal minimum obligations, do elect to provide fertility coverage in their insurance, but the list is not a long one and you can't exactly walk in to a place and say you want hired to use their expensive healthcare coverage. Regardless, I am still pursuing at least one of those companies who happens to have a retail location in Port Orchard. At this point, short of a $13,000 anonymous check in the mail, that's the only reasonable option I see for us to try. We can start saving money and hope to do IVF in the future as well, but I have strong feelings about having a child after 35. I had an older parent, and I loved them dearly, but the cost it has on your family and your child is huge. My first memory is sitting in a hospital waiting room and talking to the surgeon who had done my dad's endarterectomy. There are also of course alternatives to having our own biological children, but at this point in our lives, those choices are not the right ones for us. For now, we have no experience with children, we're the babies of our families, and we in no way feel capable of providing the right kind of environment most foster children need. Adoption is even worse than IVF to be honest, from the parent end- the waitlist for children who aren't medically fragile is 3-5 years (the are a lot more people looking for these children to adopt than there just are), and even up to 30 days after having a child placed with you, the parent can decide against adoption. This is not a rare occurrence. In addition to the cost of adoption (international is often even more costly and time consuming, often involving multiple trips to that country and 12+ mos of paperwork) and the fact that we have very limited choices for adoption in the Secular world as most agencies are part of and require religious affiliations, it's just not something we feel drawn to. After almost 6 years, we are just tired of living in the gray area, always waiting, not able to plan, and we just need to know one way or the other how to continue our lives as a family.  I just feel so lost, and angry, and frustrated, and hurt, and hopeless. I feel guilty we didn't make ourselves go to a specialist sooner, I feel betrayed by my body and annoyed at years of being careful and responsible. I feel appreciative of all the love and support I've had from friends, family, and strangers on the internet. I feel grateful we've been able to come even this far on our journey, but jealous and angry at those who don't even have to try. Regardless, we're taking a few month break from any fertility planning, and working hard on just enjoying life again, and remembering how to be happy.    As a footnote, I appreciate concern and advice, but it is not okay to suggest silly wives tales on how we could get pregnant. No one wants to hear that, you are not actually being helpful, as I PROMISE after 6 years and countless tears, my doctors and I have exhausted those options! It's mostly just very dismissive and hurtful of what we and so many other couples have gone through, so thank you for understanding!  <3 Journey To Mini-Moore Wanda Marie Worsley",

        "description": "Wanda Marie Worsley  was  feeling hopeful with  Steve Worsley . Welp, here we go. We're no longer in the planning stages of IVF.  Steve  and I met with our doctor in Seattle yesterday and set things in motion to start our first IVF cycle! I'll be on medication (birth control) to suppress my ovaries for 3 weeks to prevent the chance of hyperovarian issues and to coordinate the development of as many mature follicles at once as possible. I'll have follow up labs to determine follicle count and finalize my dosage for ovarian stimulants. Then comes 9-12 days of self-done shots to develop eggs, with daily am ultrasounds and labs in Tacoma or Seattle the last few days. We'll likely be looking at retrieval around March 13th, and if we do live transfers this cycle (based on how I feel after meds and retrieval), we'll be planning a 5 day transfer around the 18th of March. If we don't transfer this cycle, we can freeze our day 5 embryos and do the implant procedure in my April cycle with no repercussions to the expected success rate. We also have the option to freeze them all and do Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis, but beyond the $4000 cost of the tests, it only tests for chromosomal abnormalities, which are rare and few result in miscarriage or nonviable pregnancies. If we had a significant track record of miscarriages, or I were 35-40 years old, it would be recommended, but for us we don't feel it's a needed step.  We are so excited to start this, and we are so grateful to everyone for their love and support as we continue through  <3",

Short if losing my dad, nothing has ever hurt the way this did. I felt betrayed, I felt like I had let  Steve  and our family down, I felt so alone and empty.

Some have asked if we were going to do a crowdfund to help alleviate the cost of our infertility treatments; as we prepare for our journey into IVF we've decided to share our story and gratefully & humbly accept the support and love we've received. I'm not really sure what to write here even, but I guess I'll start with an enormous thank you for taking the time to listen to and share our story, which is sadly the story of so many other couples. For those that can and wish to donate, we simply cannot say thank you enough for helping lighten the load we are carrying. Beyond donating, you can help us by sharing our journey and YouCaring page with your friends and family. We'll be posting updates as often as they will be relevant, and I want to again thank you for joining us on our next step  <3",

We've been scheduling, doing labs, and talking with nurses. Today we ordered our IVF meds.... which thanks to your generosity was a less painful $2700 to spend on a single months cycle. Let's hope that's all it takes!   For those keeping track, I'll be taking HcG, Gonal f, Menopur, Entometrin, and Cetrotide. I guess I'm gonna learn to get over my fear of needles starting March 3rd.  😷 💉",

As several people asked for it, I can offer you a PERSONALLY SIGNED COPY of the Polish edition of Wild Sex - dziki seks. ...  I'm sorry it took a while!!!  The book costs € 9.25 / about $ 13.65 (CAD) / about $ 10.75 (USD)  As I need to get the books from Europe, and shipping depends on the number of ordered copies, I can't tell you the exact shipping costs yet.  I'll get some help from  Pawel Wojcikowski  with getting the books, so please contact him to place an order.  We'll wait until the END OF NOVEMBER for your orders and get the books afterwards to keep shipping costs as low as possible.   See More",

Baby is due December 5th, and we cannot be happier. Today we got to watch our little one headbang all through the 9 week ultrasound, and see their sweet little heart flickering away at 173bpm  💓 Thank you so so much to everyone who has lent us a shoulder in our times of need, helped us through our losses, and cheered us on in our victories. Some of you have literally helped fund this with over $5000 donated through our YouCaring page. Thank you so much to our amazing team of doctors and specialist at Seattle Reproductive Medicine for helping us not be defined by our infertility. We can't wait to share more updates as we progress.  👶 💑",

When in the midst of this all it feels like the end of the world, and reminders of normalcy and compassion are so helpful.

If you're in the South Lake area of Seattle, be sure to stop in at Kati Vegan Thai and try what I'm sure is delicious food! We've known Abe for years; he's a talented programmer and cook, as well as an all around incredible dude. We're so excited for him on this amazing journey! Dinner at his house was always incredible, even for an unapologetic meat lover as myself  😂  He's pretty much the reason I'm not afraid of vegan food anymore. If we were still in the PNW, we'd definitely be regular customers. Congrats Abe and Fon on your soft opening!",

Steve was going to propose over dinner, but let me pick the restaurant. I picked a teppanyaki place were you sit with a bunch of other people at a table. Our table mates were creeps, and it kinda ruined the mood. Steve waited until we got back from dinner and proposed in my dorm room. We decided to wait to tell our parents at the same time on Thanksgiving, but family plans were cancelled, and we ended up waiting until Christmas. I was terrified to tell Mary and Jay for some reason, and the night we landed in Portland we told them over the most awkward dinner of my life. Thankfully, both our families are awesome and love us.   ",

        "description": "Wanda Marie Worsley  added  4 new photos  — with  Steve Worsley  at  Mexic-Arte Museum . Had a fun day downtown Austin, finally! Visited Mexic-Arte Museum and loved their Frida & Diego exhibit. Was awesome to see so many pictures from throughout their lives together. She spent a lot of time in the hospital, but would still paint from her hospital bed with her plaster corset on. In almost every picture of them together, they had one of their Xolo dogs in their arms (and sometimes a monkey). The other half of the museum was done in Dia de los Muertos shrines to Mexican artists. There was a beautiful display for ballet dancer Amalia Hernandez- I'm guessing she liked sweets cause there were piles of Abuelitas and cocoa beans and marzipans among the dance shoes and dresses. There was of course a lovely Selena shrine in sequined purple fabric. They also had a huge shrine for pets that was amazing and had beautiful hand carved figurines. Since their admission is free on Sundays we decided to hit up the gift shop to contribute at least something to the museum. Steve picked out some beautiful hand carved hummingbird earrings for me. We'll definitely be visiting again when they swap exhibits! Tacos for our lunch and now it's nap time.",
