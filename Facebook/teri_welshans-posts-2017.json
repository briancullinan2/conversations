In every state there was a Third Party candidate. If you didn't like Hillary you didn't NEED to vote for donald... you could have voted Third Party. But you supported him.

In Support of a very special person to me, who have been struggling and following with firmness, good energy and teaches us to live every day with the best day!!! I'm watching the ones who will have the time to read this post until the end. This is a little test, just to see who reads and who shares without reading! If you have read everything, select \"like\" so I can put a thank you on your profile! Cancer is very invasive and destructive to your body. After you have finished your treatment, then, your body wants to go to war with yourself trying to reconstruct all the damage caused by radiation. It's a very long process.  Please, in honor of someone who died, or is fighting cancer, or even had cancer, copy and paste.  They all say: \"if you need anything, do not hesitate, I'm gonna be there for you\"... so I'm going to make a bet that in less than 1/2 of my friends put this on your wall. You just have to copy (not share)!!!  I want to know who I can count on,.... Write \"done\" in the comment when you do.  To all those who are fighting... I am with you always.",
