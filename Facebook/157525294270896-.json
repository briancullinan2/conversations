            "message": "Brian\nDear John,\n\nI saw a comment you made about gun control a while back, you stated \"[There is no proof that this would work]\"  As a scientist, I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I constantly seek to make wiser decisions based on past evidence and proof.  But the sad thing is, you ARE the problem with the system.  Science would not exist if it wasn't for someone with a novel idea, and the means to test their ideas.  You have hindered our society greatly by being completely indifferent, uncooperative, and apathetic towards science.  I got your letter asking for my support, and you do not have my support because you have complete disregard for my field of science and learning.  If you were a smarter man, you could set aside your greed and make Arizona the test best for such gun control laws.  Prove to DC and the rest of the country that guns can be completely secured, but will not end violence completely.  Only ending desperation and poverty can end violence as it is human nature.  You don't have to prove that something works, sometimes it is more important to prove something does not work because then people can focus on a completely different solution.  This concept is called science, please learn it.  Require every participant in the Arizona gun trade shows to get a background check before or at the entrance.  If you can't do this, please retire now because you are too old to work.  Sincerely, - Every Republican.\n"
