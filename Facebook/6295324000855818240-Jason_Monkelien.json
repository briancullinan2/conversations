As I mentioned in my message earlier as well, I have a few well paying roles in the Phoenix, AZ area, that I think would be a great fit for your background based on your work with Swiftpage, Study Sauce, and EPIC Research and Diagnostics. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me a call at 571-612-3946 at your earliest convenience, or send me some times that you would be available for a brief conversation, along with the best number to reach you. Thanks again for connecting with me Brian and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nRegards,\nJason Monkelien\nTechnical Recruiter | Princeton Information\n11600 Sunrise Valley Dr, Suite 270\nReston, VA 20191\nTel: 571-612-3946\nJmonkelien@princetoninformation.com\n"
