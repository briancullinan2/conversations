I'm sorry to share something you've seen before but...I've been thinking just like this since I was a little kid, as far back as my memory began.  I had friends, acquaintances, neighbors, enemies, family, and that was it. There are no races of cows, dogs, and cats. Why do we label ourselves by the color of our skin?  It's lazy thinking, and I will never be like that. I see loving souls, and if I see something I like about you, I pick your brain and apply your talents into my life, because you are the best at that. We all have one life, so be the best person you can.",

Tonight we take stock of some of the latest crises - from California fires, to the continuing disaster in Puerto Rico, Trump’s sham tax reform, grinding poverty rates in the US, the accelerating slide towards nuclear war in Korea and the attack on the Iran nuclear deal. And we’ll talk about heroic resistance – how people are standing up, calling to cancel Puerto Rico’s debt, blocking Trump’s latest Muslim ban, pushing back against cuts to h ... ealth care, forcing another corrupt Trump nominee to withdraw, and mobilizing against WWIII on the Korean Peninsula.  Then we’ll hear from the only progressive in the New Jersey Governor’s race, Green Party powerhouse Seth Kaper-Dale. Seth will join us live from protests against a debate that outrageously locked out all candidates who raised less than $430,000. We’ll hear how Seth is refusing to be silenced in his fight for justice in a democracy sold to the highest bidder - in New Jersey as throughout our nation. Join the conversation. Which of these crises are hitting you and your community? How are you coping? How are you fighting back? Share your thoughts, questions, & inspirations.   See More",

The man in this video speaks for other very good people, i.e., Americans, our Constitutional Republic (our country as a whole). Some of us need to sit down and think about what a good person is. Pick their brains, pick out what is good about them, and apply it to your life. Think about the types of leaders you follow, then ask yourself if you belong in a Republic or a Democracy. Which one of these 2 are you fighting for?  As a veteran, I've been fighting for both all along. Since I was fresh out of high school.  Some of us need to venture out of our comfort zones and enjoy reality. There are soo many great places to see, experience, and great Americans to meet. The same veterans whom our country ignores on the streets, are the same people that can die with a content heart, because deep down they know you can't take away their real accomplishment in life. Your freedoms.    Now go plunder villages you commy bastards  ;)  argh {>_O}",
