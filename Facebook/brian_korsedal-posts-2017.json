        "description": "Brian Korsedal Whoa!  I remember reading a trilogy of books on terraforming mars when I was a kid.  Good books.  Scientifically and technologically consistent and believable.  In the second book, \"The book ends on a major event which is a sudden, catastrophic rise in Earth's global sea levels not caused primarily by any greenhouse effect but by the eruption of a chain of volcanoes underneath the ice of west Antarctica, disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean. The resultant flooding causes global chaos on Earth, creating the perfect moment for the Martian underground to seize control of Martian society from Earth-based control.\"... scientists today reported on a huge magma flow melting the ice .... in West Antarctica... creepy.
