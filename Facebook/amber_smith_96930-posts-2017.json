A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, \"What's 2+2\"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you.  First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, \"10101000101\", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know.   So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you.\"",

I saw the guy speeding away and couldn't quite process what was happening. Its been an uphill battle all day. My keys to my home were in the vehicle so we had to change our locks and not just that but I have been on the phone with the insurance all day. I finally got a rental car squared away for tomorrow morning. Fortunately, nothing terrible happened to us physically or to our kids. Amber Smith",

When Trump ran for president, he ran a very clever campaign. He said, “Look, I’m a different type of Republican. You’re going to see me do things that no Republican has done.” And a lot of people believed him. But a year later, if you look at his record, you find that almost everything that he said was a lie.",
