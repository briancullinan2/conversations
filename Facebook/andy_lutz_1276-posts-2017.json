Some games I am fully satisfied, or even \"satisficed\", to lose. If you like obscure words then you may like that one. More madness. More secrets. A pharmacopoeia of rare meaning. We will express ourselves. I will get verbally high and experience the tactical evasion, the invasion of more words, the verbal specificity that makes a mind go round and around, up and down. Foucault opened to us the genealogy of madness and we can jump right in. Give me the definitions in all of their agreeable and disagreeable uniqueness. Let us paraphrase, inhale, and then agree and disagree again. Logic that is briefly set aside we can recapture, reappropriate, and remake... as Alligator Logic.  http://www.alligatorlogic.com/",

        "description": "Andy Lutz A list of verifiably false conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump  CFCs can’t affect the ozone layer when sprayed indoors.  California is not really in a drought.   Asbestos is safe to use in buildings.  Ebola transmits more easily than Obama and the CDC are telling you.  Vaccines cause autism and doctors are lying to you about it.  Global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese.  Net neutrality is a plot to target conservative media.  Justice Scalia was murdered.  Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination.  The 9/11 terrorists had family and friends in America who knew about the attack in advance. (Made up to justify his proposed war crime of executing family members of terrorists.) Thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated on 9/11.  “Virtually 100%” of mosques in America preach hate.   US foreign policy once permitted war crimes against Muslims demonstrated by a (bogus) anecdote about an American general in the Philippines massacring captive Muslims with bullets washed in pigs’ blood.   Obama was born in Kenya.  Obama was born “Barry Soetero”.  Obama murdered a Hawaiian official to hide the truth about his birth.  Obama is a Muslim.  Obama wears a ring with an Arabic inscription.  Obama supports Islamic terrorism.  Obama sent arms to ISIS.  Bill Ayers wrote “Dreams from My Father”.  Obama never attended Columbia.  Obama started the fraud case against Trump University for political reasons.  Obama plans to bring 250,000 Syrian refugees to America. (It’s actually 10,000.)    Most Syrian refugees are young men. (Most are women and children.)  Syrian refugees have cell phones provided by ISIS.   Syrian refugees are not vetted. (The US vetting process takes about 2 years.)  Obama is placing Syrian refugees in Republican states only.   Christians are currently banned from entering the USA. Only Muslims are allowed.  Christianity is being “shut-down” by the US government.  There are no lobbying groups for Christians, only for Muslims.  The IRS is auditing him because he is a “strong Christian”.  Obama will sign an executive order taking away your guns, and Hillary will abolish the 2nd Amendment.  Obama and Hillary will release violent offenders from prison (after they take away your guns).   Blacks kill 81% of white homicide victims. (It's 15%.)  Oakland and Ferguson are among “the most dangerous cities in the world”. (Not even close.)  Illegal immigrants are mostly dangerous criminals.   Latin American governments send their worst people to the USA.  The Obama Administration is funding illegal immigration.  There are 34 million illegals in the country today. The estimate of 11 million is a lie.  Obama manipulated government statistics on deportations.   Obama ordered the border patrol to let everyone in without question.  There is massive voter fraud in US elections.  Obama won in 2012 due to voter fraud.  Obama is lying about the drop in the number of uninsured under Obamacare.  Obama made a deal with the Saudis to flood the market with oil and drop gas prices during the 2012 election.  Obama is lying about the unemployment rate. The real rate is 25-42%.  The Clintons murdered Vince Foster.  Hillary Clinton caused the deaths at the embassy in Benghazi. Andy Lutz Doug",

So I put it in the fridge and returned about an hour later to have some for dinner only to find it was gone - all of it. About half of it was scattered around the kitchen and the rest was in the belly of my worthless brother. Gee, I wonder why he can't ever get a date or even make a friend. He drinks himself stupid and generates ungodly odors all day, and he's inconsiderate and selfish to boot! What a catch!",
