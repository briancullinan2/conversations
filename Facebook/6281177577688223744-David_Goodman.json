You have a fantastic background in front end Drupal Development, and I thought you might know of someone with a similar background to yourself, who might be looking for a career move.\n\nPDS Tech is a national recruiting firm focused primarily on providing Technology talent to Aerospace and Government. \n\nIf there's anything I can do for you in return please let me know. I would love an opportunity to return the favor.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDavid Goodman\n480.620.2744 | dgoodman@pdstech.com\n"
