I've done more than most with construction materials and horticulture. What are you thinking?\n"

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you, your organization or someone you know.\n\nSince you are reaching out to me or perhaps even accepted my invitation, you are actively trying to network. As such there are some people you absolutely need to know. These are the people that love to give and receive referrals. These are people that have had a tremendous impact on my success, just by knowing them. Send me a message and I will start making some introductions.\n\nWe also offer an opportunity to become a member of our Affiliate Network where if a referred client engages our services, the Affiliate receives an affiliate compensation of 15% of the gross fee collected. In this case we have an Affiliate Site that is used to make the introduction and allows you to track results of submission and projected payouts.\n.\n\nStephan H.
