And let me just tell you as a HUGE Twilight Zone fan, the original show is 90% commentary on subjects like race, war, and even mental health. ...  Tumblr user THETREKKIEHASTHEPHONEBOX:  honestly after get out i really think he‚Äôs the best person suited for the job and his twilight zone reboot might be enough to get me to actually go for cbs all access  Tumblr user CRINOSG:  The Original Twilight zone had an episode where a Fascist dictator was murdered by his own minions after he was shown crying in fear for his life on camera.   It also had an episode called ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alive‚Äù Where the Ghost of Hitler gives advice to a would be fascist shitheel who could have been an ancestor of Richard Spencer.   They also had an episode where a former Nazi officer visits a concentration camp to reminisce about his ‚Äúglory days‚Äù and gets tortured to insanity by the literal ghosts of his past victims.   Just throwing those out there to get ahead of the fake racist fans who will come out of the woodwork to go ‚ÄúWhat is this SJW shit.‚Äù   (And this kind of extended to Serling‚Äôs other projects as well. Night Gallery had an episode called the Devil is not mocked, where we find out Dracula was a freedom fighter against the Nazi‚Äôs during World War II, and he and his minions do in a battalion of Nazi troops occupying his castle).
