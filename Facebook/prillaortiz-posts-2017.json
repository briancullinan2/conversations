        "description": "Shane Parmely  is with  Priscilla Ortiz  and  73 others . IMMIGRANT ACTIVISTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY BEING TARGETTED FOR DEPORTATION.  California‚Äôs \"Silvia's Law\" is named for Silvia Ocampo. It lessens the punishment of immigrants convicted of non-violent crimes... like illegally applying for a drivers license which she did, and was charged and convicted of a felony.  It is no longer illegal for her to apply for a DL.  What reporters are missing in this story is that Silvia was a week away from a court date to expunge that felony conviction from her record... which would have prevented her from being deported.  IMMIGRANT ACTIVISTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY BEING TARGETTED FOR DEPORTATION BY ICE AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IT'S UP TO US TO SPEAK UP, ORGANIZE, AND RESIST. Even when your voice shakes.  Please help spread the word by sharing this post.   http://www.10news.com/‚Ä¶/san-diego-mother-deported-to-mexico‚Ä¶",

The DNC, the people who fell in line and the 47% of registered voters that didn't bother to vote gave us Trump.  That is a fact!  Admit it and wake the fuck up!  If not, prepare for Trump 2020 if he isn't impeached by then.  Things will never change, if y'all continue to make excuses and use the boogeyman in the White House as excuse number 1!    Beginning to sound like Republicans by using bullshit rhetoric to justify corruption. We told y'all then and ya'll made fun of us.  Now that the proof is there, still can't admit y'all were wrong.   # BernieWouldHaveWon   # Lockthemup    # DNCFraud Boo Madie Movie Solidarity Texas - Amarillo Chapter",

When you join the Screen Actors Guild, if someone is already using your name you ARE FORCED  ... to pick a new one.   About six months before the Bernie Campaign, I was promoting myself while working as an actor and I changed my name when I joined SAG, that is why FB allows me to use a different name.  There is a troll going around trying \"to blow the lid\" off this. Brandon Nelson is in fact my full name, Don is shortened from Brandon and Ford is my wife's name I took for acting because it is her SAG name.  Also, this means that when you look up VAMU or other things that I attach myself too the name Brandon Nelson pops up as owning it because I formed those companies under my legal name as is required and well before I joined SAG anyway.  Please share this and comment so people can see it. They are currently sending messages to Friends and Followers because they seem to think this is a \"Secret\" or that I operate multiple accounts.  These people have forgotten that when people follow your work and are inspired by it then you don't need to create fake accounts to speak on your behalf, it will happen naturally.  This all appears to be coming from a legitimate Russian troll who is among us and trying really really hard to silence me while shrinking my following. The posts from them literally say they are located in Moscow, Russia and all of their groups are Russian.  I'll be Live kinda soon, I might do two shows today.   See More",

        "description": "Blake Worthington Tomorrow I will be voting in favor of the New York State Constitutional Convention, regardless of how many bumper stickers I have seen and billboards that are blindly telling everyone to vote against taking the opportunity for the state and we the people to amend our constitution, which hasn‚Äôt been revised since 1938!   ‚ÄúThe unique democratic purpose of New York‚Äôs periodic constitutional convention referendum is to implement New Yorkers‚Äô inalienable right to alter their constitution in cases where the interests of the legislature and people conflict. New York‚Äôs Constitution allows the people to exercise this right once every twenty years.‚Äù  Yes, you read that right. WE THE PEOPLE only get the chance to make amendments to our constitution once every 20 years AND we haven‚Äôt been able to do so since 1938!  This massive campaign against the Constitutional Convention is all based off of fear- mongering. Threatening the labor and teachers unions that they‚Äôre going to take away their rights‚Ä¶ threatening environmentalists that amendments will be passed to clear-cut the Adirondacks‚Ä¶   Well, I‚Äôll tell you something‚Ä¶ if I saw the people of New York vote to pass a law clear cutting the Adirondacks or taking away the rights of labor and teacher unions, I would have to seriously consider whether New York local elections were reflecting the actual will of the people of New York and not other entities with more financial and political control. That would seriously make me think that the system is even more broken and more corrupt than we think it is.  Any campaign that is based off of fear-mongering should automatically be a red flag. The idea of threatening the people into being afraid of making positive or progressive change and taking control of their own governance, which is what a democracy is- A GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE,  indicates that somewhere there are people and entities behind the scenes that the system currently is working for quite well and they don‚Äôt want it to change. I know a couple entities offhand that I can tell you the system is working VERY well for- and it certainly doesn‚Äôt include the middle class, the lower class, the working class or the environment of New York.  You know who the system is currently working perfectly for? Wall Street- which is obviously based out of New York, Corporations, the insurance companies, the banks, the pharmaceutical companies which continue to pump millions of opiates onto our streets and into our kids which is the root cause of the New York State heroin epidemic, the chemical companies that continue to sell pesticides to the NYS agricultural industry, the Oil industry and the governmental body in which most politicians are out for their own gains and serve the sole purpose of keeping this state and this country from being a true democracy by keeping the People separated and uninvolved in their own governance.   Giving the people a chance to go to convention and revise the outdated and antiquated 1938 NYS Constitution would of course give corporate New York a giant scare. What if we passed a law to ban fracking? How would that affect the oil industry? What if we passed laws restraining the influx of highly addictive opiates into our state leading to one fatal heroin overdose A DAY on long island? What if we passed laws like other states have that doctors who treat Lyme cannot be punished by law and that the testing for Lyme Disease, since we‚Äôre at ground zero, needs to be infinitely more accurate? What if we passed a law that doctors who treat cancer holistically would be safe from punishment by law?  What if we passed laws protecting our wetlands, water table and surrounding environment from extremely harmful and dangerous pesticides which remain legal in the state? What if we passed laws about restraining the obscene insurance rates in the State of New York and restricting the denial of coverage with regards to oftentimes life-threatening issues to millions of New Yorkers? What if we made a law raising the minimum wage so that 16 PERCENT OF NEW YORKERS WEREN‚ÄôT LIVING IN POVERTY???? THAT‚ÄôS FUCKING ABYSSMAL. And that‚Äôs just for starters.  There is such an incredible amount of highly relevant issues that WE THE PEOPLE need to address that exist now, but did not exist in 1938, it is absolutely ludicrous that we should vote not to make changes to our constitution. Additionally, based on these considerations it is safe to say that it is therefore HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE to assume that there are vastly powerful entities out there that would have an particular motive in mind and the financial means and political sway necessary to generate a major campaign against something like the constitutional convention, and the calculated intelligence to make that campaign look like it came from somewhere else by insidiously infiltrating organizations like unions where it would be very easy to prey upon the group mentality.  Look around you at people here on Long Island and in New York State. Is anyone you know really doing great? Because to me it looks like everyone is poor, sick and barely making ends meet. On the other hand it looks like the Corporations, the Banks, the Insurance Companies, the Medical Industry, the Drug Companies, the Oil Industry, the Chemical companies- they‚Äôre all doing fucking great. And you know why? Its because there is nothing in our state Constitution OR our federal constitution that protects WE THE PEOPLE or the ENVIRONMENT from these gigantic, billion dollar greed machines. Corporations did not exist in they way they do now in 1938. The environmental crisis did not exist the way it does now in 1938. There was no lyme disease, no heroin epidemic, no mass mental health crisis that exists now in 1938. And so obviously the constitution does not address these highly relevant matters.  But actually you know what? Let‚Äôs just all continue to be disconnected from our own government and use an outdated constitution that doesn‚Äôt address any of these REAL concerns that are happening NOW in 2017. Lets let them continue to scare us away from creating real, positive and relevant change by threatening us that they‚Äôll try to take away whatever minimal rights we have. Because behind closed doors they‚Äôre taking them away anyway- and it‚Äôs happening quickly and secretly, and if we don‚Äôt stop buying all these fear-based propaganda campaigns and failing to do our own research and failing to use our own brains the situation is going to continue to get exponentially worse as every single day goes by.  So no matter how many bumper stickers and billboards some group behind the scenes decided to push out into the teachers unions and labor unions and under environmentalist‚Äôs noses, threatening me with clear cutting the Adirondacks isn‚Äôt quite enough to make me decide to vote for a system that continues to allow the snakes at the top to reap all the wealth for themselves, while I sit here and watch my friends and family suffer and die so they can continue to make loads of money and perpetuate a corrupt system.

We took on a monumental task: unseat an incumbent Democrat with a Green Party newcomer. 8600 people were inspired by that.  Hundreds of volunteers came out to fight over the past 9 months. Many of them stood out in the freezing wind and rain yesterday to pass out flyers to voters. Warriors. All of you.  We still have a lot of work to do. Priority #1 is stopping the Armory deal. It goes to the City Council for a vote next.  \"So what's next for you?\"  -Recruiting more black people to DSA  -Supporting Green campaigns  -No, I'm not running for anything next year  -You'll see me on the streets soon Jabari Brisport Jabari Jabari Jabari Brisport",
