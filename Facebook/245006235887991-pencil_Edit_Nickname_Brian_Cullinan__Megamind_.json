Also, we need to figure out carpool plans.  I can take 5 people comfortable, and 7 at the most.  Jessie is also planning on driving so that she can leave for Sierra Nevada girl scout camp.  That means, any one who is going with me, will be stuck in California until Sunday.  I would like to attend both days of the concert because there are so many amazing artists the second night.  Please post your thoughts so we can figure out the details.  Also, who else should we invite?  I am not sure which friends would be down for an Electronica concert, but hopefully everyone will have an open mind.\n\n"
