To get this done, I had to fire my doctors again  ;-) ...    I had a scary March, when I suddenly found out Blue Shield didn't cover my hospital anymore, and I owed $47,000 for 2 Remicade treatments, and was looking at $200k+ if insurance didn't cover it for the rest of the year.     I came to my clinic with a solution - I found an at-home nurse and pharmacy who do it for $2,100 only (Crescent Healthcare), and my insurance would likely cover that. They didn't work with me on an outside solution, instead wanted to keep trying to get my insurance company cover Remicade at the hospital, for $23k - $28k instead.     So I left my doctor, and transferred my care to Palo Alto Medical Foundation, who executed on my at-home plan immediately.     My co-pay went from $800+ each time to $500 ... to free.     Bonus, I now own my own IV pole  :-)       #PatientCEO   See More",

Why make 6-7 foot players stand on a podium then have 5 foot people try to put a medal on them?  2. Wtf were the plastic trinkets given to the players? They looks especially tiny in all those big hands. All the players seemed confused too  3. Colangelo dropped one and broke it so Melo did get one which was pretty funny.  # olympicsfail",

        "description": "Holli Houston  updated her status. Because I wanted to... tonight's debate, paraphrased:  Cooper: You understand that what you admitted to doing was sexually assaulting women?  Trump: I said some things I'm not proud of, but let's move on to more important things. I will defeat ISIS.  Cooper: Your words described actions that are sexual assault.  Trump: ISIS!  ***  Raddatz: You said you've changed. When did that happen?  Trump: Listen lady, I've apologized. And BILL CLINTON. What about BILL CLINTON? And Michelle Obama doesn't like you, Hillary - nana nana boo boo. Also, Hillary, you stole this election from Bernie. I'm going to have you locked up and the key thrown away.  ***  Raddatz: Secretary Clinton: Let's talk about your emails.  Clinton: Yes, I made a mistake. I take responsibility. Here are some examples of me taking classified information very seriously, but yes, my email situation was a mistake:  Trump: Crucify her.  Cooper: Mr. Trump: Please stop interrupting Mrs. Clinton; she's not interrupting you.  Trump: Yeah - because she has nothing to say. And for the love of all that is holy, why, moderators, aren't you asking her about her emails?  Cooper: Uhhh... that's what we were *just* talking about... ?  ***  Audience member: What about Obamacare?  Clinton: Yes - there are issues. Here are the specific benefits of Obamacare. Here are the specific problems. I have a detailed plan on my webpage about how to fix it - keeping the good, addressing the bad.  Trump: It's a disaster. I'm going to give you a great plan instead. Competition. But it's just a disaster. Nothing good about it. And Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment.  ***  Audience member: What about your stance on Muslims?  Trump: Well, the reason for Islamaphobia is because you Muslims aren't doing your part to report suspicious activity.  ***  Raddatz: What about your ban on Muslims entering the country?  Trump: Well, Captain Khan was a hero but if I'd been president, he wouldn't have died. Because I'm a genius. But NO to Syrians without \"extreme vetting\" because it's the biggest Trojan Horse ever.  Clinton: Think of the children. Let's have effective vetting, but it is unAmerican to support a ban due to religion. The Donald's position is dangerous and making the problems worse.  Trump: And Clinton let in all these illegal aliens who are criminals and hurting us. We will deport them immediately. And did I mention that Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment? He did that. Oh yeah, and ICE endorsed me.  ***  Raddatz: What about this new wikileaks thing? Is it okay for a politician to have different personal and public views?  Clinton: Different arguments work for different people; it's smart to figure out what arguments work best to get to your end game. If it was a good enough strategy for Abe Lincoln, it's good enough for me.  Further, Wikileaks + Russia = dangerous and they don't want me in office. They support Trump and are trying to get him elected because Trump + Putin, sitting in a tree... And we need to see Donald's tax returns.  Trump: You're no Abe Lincoln and I have no relationship with Russia.   And I pay millions in taxes - more than Hillary's friends Buffet and Soros pay -- but I won't release my tax returns until the audit is over.  ***  Audience member: What about tax loopholes for the rich?  Trump: Yes, I take advantage. Hillary never got them changed in all her years in office. I don't care that she was only one senator under a republican president and with a republican congress. This shows how ineffective she was.   Clinton: I don't even know where to begin because everything Trump just said is utter nonsense. Here's my record on the topic.  Trump: Her campaign donors do what I do, but I'm not going to to tell you who they are, because they're not famous like I am. And, did I already mention that Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment? Oh, and Hillary created ISIS.  Clinton: Here's my actual record on this topic.  ***  Raddatz: Let's talk about Syria - what would you do?  Clinton: It's a grave situation. Here are the problems; here are some of my ideas to solve it.  Trump: Clinton was a horrible secretary of state, she was there when Obama drew his line in the sand.  Clinton: Actually, I wasn't still secretary of state at that time.  Trump: Whatever. Facts don't matter. Our military is a disgrace; it's old and tired. Libya. Russia! ISIS! Syria! Iran nuclear deal! Russia, Assad, and Iran are the world's heros.   Raddatz: Pence says we should be prepared to attack Assad if he and Russia continue to do what they're doing.  Trump: I disagree. Now let's talk Iraq and the poor military strategy there. My plan is secret and it will be the best plan.   Raddatz: What if a non-secret plan is a strategic decision - you know, for psychological warfare or other reasons?  Trump: I know of no reason, ever, to not have a secret plan. But I am smarter than everyone else.  Clinton: Here are some details of my plan.  The pros, the cons ‚Äì things I‚Äôve considered.  I will consult with experts.  Trump: She got more time than me. Waaa.  ***  Audience: Can you be the president of all the people of the USA?  Trump: She certainly can‚Äôt.  She called some people deplorable.  I can.  Our inner cities are a disaster.  The Latino-Americans, the African-Americans.  Life is a disaster.  What do you have to lose with me?  Clinton: Here‚Äôs my record of what I have actually done, and I was generally well liked by the people I represented, which was a pretty diverse group.  Trump: Yeah ‚Äì but she called some people deplorable. And irredeemable.  Clinton: My argument is with Trump, not his followers.  I want to be everyone‚Äôs president.  And Bernie supports me now.  ***  Cooper: Do you think it shows good temperment to tell the public to watch a sex tape, via Twitter at 3 a.m.?  Trump: I didn‚Äôt do that.  And Clinton is sometimes awake at 3 a.m., too.  And Twitter is a good means of communication.  ‚ÄúI am not unproud of what I did, to be honest with you.‚Äù  ***  Audience: What about the Supreme Court?  Clinton: Citizens United = bad; Roe v. Wade = Good; marriage equality = good.  Senate should have done its job to fill the vacancy.  Trump: Scalia! Scalia! Scalia!  And the Second Amendment.  And by the way, I‚Äôm contributing way more of my personal money to this campaign than Hillary is to hers.  So there.  ***  Audience: What‚Äôs your energy policy?  Trump: Go backwards; get rid of the EPA! COAL!  Clinton: Energy independence; natural gas = a good bridge on our way to clean and renewable energy.  ***  Audience: Can you say something nice about the other?  Clinton: Trump has nice children.  Trump: She‚Äôs a fighter.  She doesn‚Äôt quit. Holli Houston",

        "description": "The Cynical Pharmacist Lots of people sent this to me asking for my opinion. Here goes...  If you ask the wrong questions, you will get the wrong answers.   Personally, I like the study in that it brings to light what many pharmacists and staff have been saying for a long time: working conditions are worsening, staff are being cut, metrics must be met, and alarm fatigue is a real issue. However, the question won't be \"How do we get PHARMACIES to improve?\" Instead, it will be \"How do we hold PHARMACISTS more accountable?\"   Customer complaints are up and staff hours are down at my pharmacy. My boss told me that if we don't do more flu shots, increase our script count, and improve our scores, she will cut hours again. Sounds rather counterintuitive, right?   One Saturday I took it upon myself to scientifically prove that alarm fatigue is a real problem in retail. I decided that I would mark down each prescription I reviewed as either a Level 1 (severe enough to require an override), Level 2 (no override needed), or Level 3 (no review at all) interaction. After checking 72 prescriptions in the first hour, I halted the study. The results were expected, but surprising nonetheless. ALL 72 prescriptions required a Level 1 override.   That is 100%. How can a system designed to show me the MOST SEVERE interactions have every single prescription marked as SEVERE?   As I've written in previous posts, Close the Pharmacy. No one needs to see what we do. It will limit distractions.   Research tech ratios. Research pharmacist fatigue and how many prescriptions can (should) be checked per shift. Research the companies that employ metrics but tell the pharmacists they can work at their own pace. Why are so many State Board of Pharmacy Seats occupied by representatives of the major chains?   Please let this expose be the start of real change in the industry. Unfortunately, as with all other changes I've witnessed in my career, the onus will fall on the pharmacist herself.   Remember the post I did about \"terrorists\" poisoning the water supply? Instead of focusing on the problem at the source (prescribers), it focused on legislating the end of the line (pharmacists). Let's not let that happen here. Grant Jackson Nicar",

The strength of it is directly proportional to the acceptance by my colleagues of the twist-of-phrase.   Why is it that patients always say the same thing? It's not just every patient reciting the same line; I'm talking about every patient repeating the same line each time he visits the pharmacy.  ...  CP: What is your date of birth?   Pt: I come here all the time.   CP: Then you know I ask for it every time. You really should be better prepared next time.   CP: Do you have your insurance card with you?   Pt: It's in the computer. I come here all the time.   CP: I think you have a serious problem. Insurances should not be that stimulating.   CP: Any changes to your personal information?  Pt: I come here all the time.   CP: I realise corporate pharmacy has prostituted our profession, but you really need to stop doing that. We are not literal prostitutes and since only the pharmacists are Blood and OPIM (Other Potentially Infectious Materials) trained, we're tired of cleaning up your \"accidents\".   CP: Do you have any allergies?   Pt: I come here all the time.   CP: I'm glad we excite you that much, but you should really try to wait until you get home. They make medication for that.   Pt: Really? What medications treat that?   CP: SSRI's are one class.   Pt: SSRI's?   CP: Yes. And to help you remember, when you write it down, it actually looks as if the acronym is trying to say \"So Sorry\".   Now that I finally wrote this post, I can say  # ThatsALoadOffMyMind .

        "description": "Sarah Johnson  was with  Scott Johnson . Tonight was the first time since Karlie was born that rage filled my body and I almost went full momma bear towards someone else's kid. But in the half second it took me to stand (okay a few more than half, I am pregnant), Scott jumped up and beat me to it. Let me explain.   We let Karlie play in a small play area at a restaurant. We were sitting not more than 10ft away both of us keeping an eye on her. There was a little boy who was older than her playing in there too and I notice him shove her twice. I tried to brush it off thinking it wasn't a big deal, she can handle it. I watched and she didn't do anything to provoke it. Normally if she took a toy from him, or squawked at him I could see his reasoning but that didn't happen. About 3 min later Karlie stands to reposition herself in the play area and this boy stands up pushes her, she stumbles backwards, he takes another step towards her and shoves her in the belly until she hits the ground. Again unprovoked!! This sent fire through my body. Thankfully scott jumped up, ran over and said in loud stern voice \"No! That's not okay. It's not okay to push people.\" Karlie is a tough cookie and she stood bewildered not knowing what just happened but overall she was fine. The boys mother comes over from across the restaurant and yells at my husband that he was being excessive. He should back off because he's autistic.  Okay friends, I'm an educator. I'm a mom. I'm a believer in community parenting. I'm not wrong when I say, my husband could not have known that boy was autistic because I didn't even notice. His mother was no where to be seen when any of this was happening and she had the nerve to yell at my husband and say absolutely NOTHING to her son. I'm all for supporting children who have autism. That's not why I'm mad. I'm mad because I don't believe that you should let your child act out, repeatedly, do nothing to stop him from hurting another child, clearly not watching him at all AND didn't apologize for pushing my daughter to the ground. If he is incapable then it's the parents responsibility. My husband was trying to help him understand that behavior isn't okay. She swooped in, yelled autism in his face and got mad at my husband! I'm sorry but that's not okay. He had no intention of hurting that kid, he just didn't want his daughter getting beat up on when she didn't deserve it. The mother should have been closer by and intervened sooner if she knew he had these tendencies. He's older/bigger than Karlie. His mother should have been monitoring and jumped in to help teach him. The kid clearly understood what Scott was saying. At this point, the mom picked him up and left, meanwhile the dad came over to apologize to my husband and followed his wife out.   All I have to say is, my love for my husband grew deeper in that moment seeing him defend her and also because he did it much more gracefully than this pregnant, former teacher, momma bear would have.",

        "description": "Scott Johnson Season recap:  1) This was the Most up and down season I have seen from the packers since I have been alive.   2) While the better team won the game this time, the Packers were the better team yet again for almost the entire game only to blow it late.   3) It will never happen, but the packers need to move on from McCarthy.     A)When your best receiver sits on the bench the entire year and it takes injuries to 4 different Wr to get to him, something is seriously wrong with your talent evaluation.  # whitelightning   # jeffjanis . Sometimes you have to let the athletes make plays and let them prove it on Sundays (or Saturday or Monday or Thursday)    B) the play calling debacle.     C) consistent misuse of timeouts    D) Reluctance to try anything different when something isn't working.     E) 1 Super Bowl when your QB is the GOAT.     F) The passive decision making.  It cost them the victory against Seattle last year and while it's been better this year it's still not enough.     G) I will admit he is a good coach and for most cities and towns that's ok, but he is not a great coach and GB needs better. See letter E for reason 1. He has had 2 HOF qbs and not much to show for it.   4) As it showed many times this year Aaron is unbelievable.  As with Favre, anytime he steps on the field his team has a chance to win. He was not at his best this year which I am sure he would admit, but he was still better than most qbs (top 10 this year, but not top 2 or 3 like every other year).  5) Because of #4 well really number 12, my expectations are high heading into next year, but reserved due to some limitations (#3).   6) I want to thank my  Sarah  for putting up with so many rants (#jeffjanis) about football when she probably didn't care. We have had many more important things come up this year but she always let me watch the games.   6a) Sarah's football knowledge. She continues to blow me away with her observations, comments and understanding of the game. Also her hatred for the terrible duo of Joe Suck and Troy Aikman that packers fans got stuck with way to often this year as Fox \"number 1 broadcast team\" (more like #2). I am lucky that my wife not only watches the games with me, but can have a real debate about something as silly as a football game.   # packers",

My sweet husband has been tolerant of my shenanigans since November when this pregnancy got real, quick. Since then he has poked fun at me for getting into bed so early (like 7/7:30) and wanting to sleep. He's so great for putting up with me after coming home from a long day at work, making dinner, putting Karlie to bed and checking on me before doing his own thing. I realize tonight he's SUPER exhausted when he beat me to the snoring phase by at least an hour. I love you hun. Thanks for being awesome and I'm glad you're asleep before me this time.",

Which doesn't surprise me that 2 years ago my water broke at 8am (beginning of a work day), by 12pm I was in labor (lunch time) and by 5:02 she made her grand entrance (end of work day). True to form she has napped this way, played his way, and woke this way for 2 years including this morning. Happy 2nd birthday my sweet, intelligent, funny, beautiful girl. Every day with you is a joy. I love you with every fiber of my being. I'm so excited to see you take on the world.",
