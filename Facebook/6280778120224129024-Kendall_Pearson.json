It is a very collaborative environment that encourages team work and team building activities such as regular catered lunches and happy hours. This being said, you do have to work on-site, however, unlike many other employers, they offer unlimited paid-time-off to encourage a good business-personal life balance. \nAfter reviewing your previous experience and skillset on Linkedin, I think you could be a great fit for one of these developer positions. When you have a moment, please call me at the office at 404-335-7277 or 404-257-7900.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful day, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\nBest,\n\nKendall Pearson\nKendall.Pearson@InsightGlobal.com\n404-257-7900\n"
