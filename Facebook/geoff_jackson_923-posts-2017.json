I know you're gonna come out and see it off to the great big video-hosting site in the sky. Michael won't be able to make this one, so I asked four of our favorite past guests ( Rose Luardo ,  Moses Laurent ,  Geoff Jackson  and  Annie Paradis ) to simultaneously host in his place. I'll assume my normal position on the orange couch, like a faithful dog. We also have three guests on who we've been meaning to have on for a while now,  Jacquie Baker ,  Aaron Abramowitz  and  Matthew Schmid ! If you miss it, that's it. You've missed it. Michael",

Started off at  Good Good Comedy Theatre  on what's my line with special guest host  Matthew Schmid .   Carl Boccuti  had the line of the night renaming it \"Woke my line\".  The entire show was fire and I would have been happy to just go home after that, but I didn't.  Instead headed over to  Helium Comedy Club - Philadelphia  and saw two of my oldest friends in comedy  Sidney Gantt  and  Alex Grubard  open for Dov Davidoff.   Then I was over at  PHIT Comedy , opening for  Secret Pants .  I've known these guys, for nearly a decade.  The crowd was great and their first sketch was one of the best sketches I've ever seen.    Finished off the night at O'Sheas because I was surprised by  Brendan Kennedy ,  Patrick Foy  and  Sam Mckay  showing up from out of town.  Do your self a favor and check out  Geoff Jackson  opening for Secret Pants - unrehearsed tonight at PHIT. It will change your life!",

She's a single mom, an enthusiastic business woman, and---She's married to 5 men! From the writers of \"Referee Uncles\" and \"Ken Bone Christmas in the Bahamas\" ABC Family presents a sitcom set in a world where polyandry/polygamy is totally legal: It's \"Stepdads!\"  NEXT WEDNESDAY  That Just Happened  @  Good Good Comedy Theatre  @ 8:30pm!   https://www.facebook.com/events/1797934777202736/  Featuring videos with an amazing cast:   Rachel Peters   Alejandro Morales   Michael Kelly   Tommy Touhill  Teddy  Hanson   Geoff Jackson   Max Barth   Shane Barbera  Rick Helpa  Bill Reick   Chris Honey  Ryan Hendo  Eddie Duke   Fam Doo  Don't know if you wanna see that, and wondering what the hell I am all about? Then this Friday, @  Plays & Players   @ 9:30pm come check out VarieTree!    https://www.facebook.com/events/112752406031887/   Jillian Markowitz  and I spent a few weeks with Tommy Touhill coming up with a comedy show. It didn't pan out as planned so my girlfriend came up with a stupid portmanteau and with the added help of Jillian's professional level tree wordplay it turned into this wonderful comedy variety show where I make Tommy feel bad while he is dressed in a poorly made tree costume between some of Philly's best comedy acts! Featuring John Deary,  Audrey III , Geoff Jackson, and Max Barth!  For now enjoy the theme song to Stepdads!",

Didn't get picked to tell my story, but I got to sit with my good buddy Nick Kupsey, and the storytellers (including Geoff Jackson and Steve Clark) were great.  After the show, Chip Chantry, who was the host, told me he looked in the bucket after all ten names had been picked. There were only 2 names left. Mine and Kupsey's.  KUPSEY IS A FUCKING JINX",

The pace quickens tomorrow (9/1) night as I guest host  The Slam w/ guest poet Annaliese Downey!  A swift trip in a hired carriage will carry me across town so that I may appear on  Comedy for Gentlemen!  that same evening!  Saturday (9/2) We shall be thinking of Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart and his famous phrase \"I know it when I see it\" on  Beth and Ralph's Porn Stash  Sunday (9/3) Heart-attack. Probably near a beach while dressed in a bathing costume of continental European style.  9/6 Featuring at W@#$&! Wednesdays  9/8  Darlings (w/ musical guest Sour Flour!)  It's the premiere of a new comedy supergroup featuring so many of my favourites. We're going to do it every Friday night. Tits.  9/9  What's My Line? - September Edition!  My year-long silent quest to appear on  Dave Metter 's game-show will be achieved.  9/9  Sex with Ecks - September Edition!  In which a contraband sex-manual I received in my youth will be presented to the world.   9/11  My Own Personal 9/11  Where I shall tell the tale of my very first public comedic performance.  9/19 A Storytelling Event that is classified: \"Hot Secret\"  Is that everything?",

I didn't get to see everything but DAMN these were such funny moments:  -  Ari Fishbein 's impersonation of Alex Jones.  🤭  I thought he might break the dang table with his fists. He was so angry!  -  Geoff Jackson  making an audience member chug a big 'ol beer to join his ninja foot clan!!  -  Chris McGrail  spilling an UNNECESSARY but hilarious amount of soup all over  Daniel Lewis Cupps  on his way to do the \"tip dance\"...repeatedly.   -  Aaron Nevins  berating  Daniel Lewis Cupps  for telling everyone not to tip.  -  Rose Luardo  &  Shannon Fahey 's spot on and grossly attractive ASMR + a lil bit of acrobatics.  -  American Trappist !  💫  Be there next week! Or any week! Or all weeks! You will enjoy yourself unless you're a stupid ass curmudgeon who doesn't know how to let loose ya freak.   PLUS my dear old friend  Mike Nigro  will be performing music on the show.  😊",

        "description": "Aaron Nevins Damn, I spoke a day too soon about my favorites from  Good Good Comedy Theatre 's first year. Last night's Anniversary Sampler show shot way up my list immediately.  So many people came out that we had to turn people away at the door, and that audience made for one of our best crowds ever, keeping their energy up the entire way through what ended up being a 2.5 hour show (whoops).  Thank you to all the showrunners involved. Everybody somehow crammed the essence of their shows into 5-minute slots, making for one incredible and eclectic show. GO SEE ALL OF THESE SHOWS:   Let's Start a Cult  ( Ari Fishbein )   Sex with Ecks  ( Robert Ecks )  Get Work ( Dan Vetrano )   Dungeon Palz  ( Matt Aukamp )   That Just Happened  ( Daniel Lewis Cupps  &  Shane Barbera )   Make Up or Break Up  ( John Deary  &  Alyssa Al-Dookhi )  Excuse My Dust ( Jaime Fountaine  & a box of wine)  Oral Presentations ( Chris Wood )   UR MOM is FUNNY  ( Hannah Trav  &  Pete Steele )  Darlings (lots of people but  Kyle Harris  killed it last night)  What's My Line? ( Dave Metter )   Good Morning New Miami - The End of Days Time Talk Show  ( Reem Seliem  &  Andrew Shearer )  Talkmasters ( Kate Banford )  FEUD! ( Amanda Taylor  &  LeMaire Lee )  Schooled ( Geoff Jackson )  Comedian Psychoanalysis ( Michael S. Watkins  &  Joe Bell )  This Delinquent Life ( Chris Stenta ,  Gabriel Brogden  &  Tommie Turner )   Weeding Out The Stoned  ( Alex Grubard )   The Slam - Real Poets. Real Comedians.  ( Annie Paradis )   Phone It In Film Festival  ( Tyler Pelayín Horst )   Eat Your Beats  ( Alejandro Morales  &  Alyssa Al-Dookhi )",

Also thanks to  Good Good Comedy  for providing the space and support that made it possible. Sadulous will be back in 2018 as an all-new stage show AND a web series.   After pushing through one of my most severe bouts of depression these past weeks, it feels fitting that I was able to keep my demons at bay using an artistic recreation of those very demons.
