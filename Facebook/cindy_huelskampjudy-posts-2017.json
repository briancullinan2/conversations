She is a black lab mix and weighs about 60 lbs. She has bad knees and usually walks with a limp. She doesn't normally have whipped cream on her face like below  :/  ... and her fur is less black now (may look more brown and shaggy). Please share and help us find her.    Update: Still looking as of Tuesday evening. Last probable sighting at Catalina Highway/Prince. Thank you for all of the shares.",

I never thought I would be one of those mother's that write an open letter for all to read but here I am.  Today while at the swimming pool my heart was breaking! You see NO ONE wanted to play with my son. He would go up to other kids and say \" hi boy or hi girl.\" He is sti ... ll categorized as nonverbal and he is hard to understand but he was trying his best! Every single time the kids would either look at him weird and say nothing or just swim away.  Brandon would look back at me with a look of disappointment. Not understanding why the kids were being mean to him.  Parents, please educate your children! Tell your children that children with special needs want the same thing they do, they want to be accepted. They want to be included and treated just like every other \"normal\" child. They want friends that won't judge them and will just accept them as they are.   If they ask what is Down syndrome? Tell them it is a third copy of the 21st chromosome. Every person with Down Syndrome will learn to do the same thing as everyone else it just takes them longer to get there. They will need more help to there. But they WILL get there!   Secretly I hope this might go viral. Please feel free to share this on our page. Help me to spread awareness for all children with special needs just not down syndrome. They just want to be loved, accepted and included!!   See More",

        "description": "As most of you know i rarely post items about my life for all to see, however i am making an exception in this case as i feel its very important. On Sunday evening upon eating a hamburger from our grill i felt something abnormal in my burger. I tried to spit it out and tried to cough up anything that may be there. Upon eating my second bite  i felt a needle like pain in my throat. I spent 5 hours  ... in out patients and after some xrays they determined that I had a foreign like straight object in my throat. After an  IV i was sent home and they were going to try to get a surgeon in Yarmouth to extract it. Monday morning the out patients doctor called and said that i would need to go to Halifax as no one in Yarmouth had the equipment or expertise to remove. Arrived in Hfx at 12:00. The doctors were great. The young ENT doctor on call told us that he was going to be brutally honest and that he sees this all the time and that there was a one in one hundred chance of finding it. He scoped me through my nose for five minutes and was able to see it. Normally he said he would have scheduled me for surgery last night after finding it but wanted to try to remove in the exam room. Lets just say the procedure is not a fun one and would not wish it on anyone. He used a second scope and was able to extract. He told me that i was a very lucky man and that i should buy a lotto ticket. The piece he extracted was from our barbecue brush and a out one inch long. Our brush is in good shape and i hardly use it. He says he gave up his brushes 10 yrs ago because he sees this sort of thing a lot. The thing that was concerning was that he said a lot of times they cannot be found because they imbed themselves in the soft tissue of your throat and that you end up doing more damage by poking around trying to find it to remove. They end up leaving them there and you live with the discomfort. Every time i was swallowing it felt like a needle was in there. Not fun. The thing that bothered me was that if we had provided burgers to anyone else, especially our grand children it would have been worst. I do not believe a small child would have been able to go through the procedure to remove very easily at all. We went  to Costco and bought wooden scrapers for each of our kids. Here is a picture the surgeon took of my throat with the bristle. It is blown up several times of course. All this to say to my facebook friends, please consider very seriously of getting rid of your wire brushes.   See More Drew Cabe Danny Graves Nancy Tanner Roberts Abby Roberts Price",

        "description": "A few weeks ago, I bought a pair like these, \"jelly\" shoes for my granddaughter, McKinley. She has only worn them twice. The second time being on Tuesday when I took her to the Dr. The nurse came in and said I'll need to stick her toe for some blood. So she stuck her big toe on her left foot and left the room. I continued to play with McKinley,  (who just turned 10 months yesterday) to keep her oc ... cupied. The nurse came back in and She said I need to check her again, her lead levels are really high.  (Above 60)....(normal is below 3.3) she said by the way is she wearing Jelly shoes from Wal-Mart? I looked at the nurse a second, thinking that's a weird question. Then I said yes, why? She said Google it. There are reports that Wal-Mart jelly shoes contain lead. So we washed her right foot off and they rechecked it....it was at a 6, so the nurse said just by washing it it dropped that much but lets do her finger to make sure it's normal,  and it was below 3. There were several children over the  last few months wearing Jelly shoes from Wal-Mart that had the same results. So I threw the shoes in the trash at the Drs. Office. Then we went to Wal-Mart to see if the shoes are still in the store. They were still there, so we talked to an employee in the  shoe dept. I told him the story and he said ok I'll tell a manager. So we left, I thought I'll call Wal-Mart and speak to a manager myself just in case the employee forgets about it. I called and asked for a manager, Blake answered the call. I told him the whole story and he said I'll check into it.  I went back to Wal-Mart today and the shoes are still there.  So if you have these shoes throw them away or start to buy these shoes, DON'T!!   See More Ysa Yvette Guadalupe Karina Meza Jordan Lutz Margaret Ross Daniels",
