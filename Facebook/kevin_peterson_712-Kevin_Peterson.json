Here's the deal:  it's not that it's a swear word or anything, but it does stir up images of people getting what they deserve, or that if you do enough good then good things will happen or you or that God will be pleased with you for it.  That's where Christians would disagree.  We recognize that we don't get what we deserve (which is death and hell) but instead God looks at us and gives us what in fact we don't deserve, life, and we receive this as a gift and not because we were nice enough to the right people.  That's probably what the pastor meant though I do think he should have taken the time to explain it with you.\n"
