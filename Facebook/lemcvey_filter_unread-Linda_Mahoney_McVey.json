You should also show that you have been working since you were 15.  Shows ambition.  The other area is the references.  You should never list a family member as a reference.  In the interview you can tell the person that you worked for your dad and he could reference you, but it doesn't look credible on the resume without explanation."

My dad also recommended using someone else's name for my work at national sign so I will change that.
