I always offer an invite for coffee or a beer to local people who connect since what's the point of connecting on LinkedIn if we can't see how we can help each other out. \n\nI would love to meet up for coffee or a beer if you have some time we could schedule one day. \n\nThanks and have a great rest of the week,\nEric\n"
