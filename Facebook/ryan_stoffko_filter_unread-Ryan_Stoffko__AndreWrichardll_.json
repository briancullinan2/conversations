That tag in particular is my full name and my birthdate; came across an interesting way to view the world overseas and began applying it to my daily life- but I need to program a few things..... which I kept in order via simple hashtags. They also allow me to randomly come across stories from my past in a way which was humorous and random while allowing me to continue to sort new information as well."
