Thanks a lot!  Me:  Ok, well, even in the article you're citing it says that those were \"Independent\" voters who were never going to vote for Hillary anyway, so MOST accurately, it's the 46.4% of ALL voters who are directly responsible.  Centrist:  Yeah, but they're independents and NOT even Democrats.  Me:  Um, yes.  Exactly.  It actually says that in the fucking article you keep citing.  They were not even going to vote for your candidate anyway so there's no way you can reasonably count them as \"lost.\"  So . . . seriously, what is your point?  Centrist:  Bernie cost Hillary the election!  Me:  How is that the case when Hillary lost a two person election to someone NOT named Bernie Sanders?  Centrist:  12% of Bernie Supporters voted for Trump.  Thanks a lot!  Me:  YES.  Because they were never going to vote for her ANYWAY.  Centrist:  Yeah but they're independents and not even a Democrat!  Me:  OMFG . . . How old are you?  Centrist:  63.  I'm a grownup who knows more than you'll ever learn.  Like, did you know that Bernie Sanders isn't even a Democrat?   üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥ üò≥   üñï üñï üñï üñï üñï üñï  to Centrism.  ",

MUST READ.***  The words \"Republican\" & \"Democrat\" are as fluid as what remains our American population, representative of every Faith & Heritage on Earth.  As I type this, I look over at my little kitty, Teddy, as he slooooowly shuts his eyes to nap.  He's named after one of my favorite Presidents.  Theodore Roosevelt.  A Republican.  I'm a lifelong registered Democrat.  Essentially, they're really meaningless.  It is the action behind the words that define them.  The essential key for any growth, no matter the desired destination, lays directly in not only the capacity, but more importantly the active willingness to be WRONG.  I believe Mr. King is completely accurate in his assessment of the actions taken by my current and fluid, Democratic Party.  I hope.  I hope.    I hope, we are all actively willing to be wrong, learn, grow, and move on from there.",

That's the absolute BEST you motherfucks have come up with so far.  Because again, you're Diet Coke, Sociopathic, Free Market Republicans.  You are 1000% out of your element.  Y'already told me.  From Donna Brazille:  \"So I followed the $$$MONEY$$$. My predecessor, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had not been the most active chair in fundraising at a time when President Barack Obama‚Äôs neglect had left the party in significant debt. As Hillary‚Äôs ca üòµ mpaign gained momentum, she resolved the party‚Äôs debt and put it on a starvation diet. It had become dependent on her campaign for survival, for which she expected to wield control of its operations.  Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn‚Äôt been very interested in controlling the party‚Äîshe let Clinton‚Äôs headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn‚Äôt have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I had been trying to uncover for the last few weeks.  By September 7, the day I called Bernie, I had found my proof and it broke my heart.\"  Remember Centrists.  YOU.  YOU couldn't just get behind THIS.  YOU. PASSED.  I swear to whatever's above us themselves . .   Your fucking TOYS. Had BETTER been worth it.  BUY. A. FUCKING.

You leaned more RIGHT, according to your OWN words.  Fortunately, your actions do flesh that out.  In 1992, Billary was elected President, with a REPUBLICAN RED congress passed the Saint Ron Reagan written NAFTA.  The GOLD STANDARD of Trickle Down Economic Theory.  YOU guys were in on the ground floor.  NOW.  The consequences of those decisions were SO catastrophic it may have cost Hillary an election, even 25 years later.  Even AFTER, she had the \"humility(?)\" to not even bother to show up to the states most adversely affected by said Republican NAFTA bill.  So Centrists, if you can't explain why cheating is completely acceptable and you can't explain why you wasted an entire year pointing fingers, maybe you CAN explain why it is that we need to continue to wait for YOUR Right Wing Trickle Down Economic Theory to actually work . . .   Maybe you can explain THAT.  GO.",

So, again, when confronted with the fact that democrats have lost over 1,000 seats since the election of BO and the most progressive campaign of all time, the 65yo+ person elected to make it about . . . PARTS.  PARTS.  BEFORE addressing the issues of the active party.  Doesn't that sound . . . eerily familiar?  Be. HONEST. For ONE. GD TIME. Centrists.

So in the most ultimate display of Centrism, I was just told to go fuck off with my Nazi last name.  In MY most ultimate display of Progressivism, I'm gonna take that assertion, snap it right the fuck over my knee and SHOW you what a REAL Democrat.  Looks Like.  . . . .   I never met either one of my grandfathers.  They were both passed away by the time I was old enough to have memories.  I know I was at least held by my Mom's dad.  I don't know if my dad's dad ever got that chance.  What I've come to learn of the man is that he pretty much is Don Draper.  Korean War Switcheroo, womanizing . . . meh, maybe not.  BUT.  He was born poor.  Had nothing but his charm to get by, and he did so tremendously, to the point of literally becoming a successful advertising executive on . . . Madison Avenue.  First in his family with some money, so after the classic Manhattan \"Playboy\" apartment a couple blocs away from the UN, it was time to move the family to Scarsdale.  So after working his life into order, meeting and marrying his Firecracker of a wife, my grandmother Annette, the house in the Burbs, the two cars, and the 401k, he looked around at his life and UNLIKE Don, said to himself, \"I could be doing more for other people.\"  So, he took his Firecracker of a wife and they, together threw whatever they could into the effort to desegregate the schools of the district.  They were the \"Point - To\" White people.  By that time, my dad, the middle child had been born, an older brother, a younger sister.  Two cars, the backyard and a place \"outside of town\" for family getaways.  AND they were working on making the world a better place.  Apple Pie AF.  EXCEPT.  That my grandfather is Jewish.  EXCEPT.  That my grandmother called every single number in the school phone book to get \"another\" white boy besides my dad to show up at black kids birthday party, to NO success.  EXCEPT.  That EVERY. MORNING. Again, to NO success, my same grandmother would get up to wash the words \"N***er Lovers\" off of their fence, HOPEFULLY before the kids would have to see, for their efforts in confronting the ugliness of the day Face On.  They did, and my dad went on to found an educational non - profit in SF's Hunters Point District, the equivalent to a Harlem or Compton for SF.  So . . .  When some. DUMB. SHIT. CENTRIST. Tries to call me a Nazi . . .   It just goes to show how far OUT of your element, YOU ARE when it comes to credibly discussing American Politics.  It just goes to show how much you lean on 100% Factually WRONG information.  It just goes to show how much you would prefer to tap into the deepest, most regrettable decisions made by man BEFORE you take a single look in the mirror.  *Update, upon learning that I was Jewish, I was told,  1.  They could smell my Matzah Balls burning  2.  That my family was actually Jewish, Nazi wannabees, suffering from a sever case of Stockholm syndrome.  3.  That my time would be better spent making bagels, and lox and robbing people.  And finally that   4.  \"Anti semitism is fun!\"  Centrists.  FOR. ONE. SINGLE. TIME.  ARE you gonna hold one of your own accountable?  If not.  OK.  This IS you.  This is WHO you people are.  WOEFULLY uninformed, arrogant, and completely out of touch with reality.  AND TOTALLY prejudice, but just QUIET about it.  Ya fooled most people.  NOT everyone.  Just most.  And that'll do.  Make a choice.  HOLD this anti - semite accountable OR admit that you really are just the shitty people we all know you to be, who are in it for the money, JUST like your Republican counterparts.",

You have deliberately built your life to AVOID things like icky politics.  That's HOW you end up . . . in the CENTER!!  As far away as possible from the people doing the ACTUAL work.  This is NOT hard.  I build my case on the fact that DOZENS of you have already told me . . .   Essentially, floating around one of these three things:  1.  That you were SHOCKED to your core by the election of DJT.  2.  That you SHOULD'VE been paying more attention and took politics for granted.  3.  You've never been involved in politics prior to the RESULTS of the 2016 Election.  DOZENS of you, HRC supporting Centrists have, told me these things directly to my face.  YOUR. NEXT. BREATH. was to fuel you following up with \"But Bernie and his supporters are just so unrealistic.\"  I smiled.  I nodded.  I.  CODDLED your infantile approach to American Politics.  I'm. DONE. with that exhausting, fruitless exercise.  YOU.  Need to reconcile.  RIGHT NOW.  How it is that you can, in two breaths, admit to NOT paying attention BUT still know more about politics than someone who lives and breathes them 24/7?  Reconcile those COMPLETE. OPPOSITE. POV'S that you have simultaneously \"held\" for a year straight.  You've never been involved in politics, but somehow you know better.  GO.",

        "description": "Annie Voorhees Lenka Kay wrote this. It is heartbreaking and every word of it is true:   So, for those that may have missed it - Bernie supporters were vindicated yesterday and proven right all along.  Donna \"I fed Hillary Clinton the debate questions\" Brazille revealed in her new book that Hillary's campaign, thru shady lawyer Marc Elias, drafted a contract with the DNC to take over the entire Democratic Party, its direction, and ALL of its finances before she even announced her candidacy.  This allowed Hillary's campaign to not only RIG the election against Bernie Sanders, but it was revealed that after funds were sent to states to support down ballot Democrats (how the DNC is supposed to work), the money was all sent back to Hillary's campaign headquarters in Brooklyn to be used by Hillary. Not surprisingly, many Democrats lost their seats to Republicans last November because their campaigns were poorly funded.  Last week, it was revealed that the same Marc Elias, representing Hillary's campaign, used DNC funds to pay the Kremlin and other nefarious characters to concoct the now infamous dossier alleging Trump pissed on a Kremlin hotel bed that Obama had slept on.  I kid you not.  So understanding that the DNC, an organization that was supposed to remain neutral and allow the will of the people to vote for our leaders, was under COMPLETE control of Hillary Clinton, we can now revisit the infamous DNC email by Wikileaks....  The one where the Hillary campaign directed the DNC and media to elevate via increased news coverage - Donald Trump - so that Hillary could run against Donny and win the presidency by a landslide.  But it backfired, and we now have Trump.  It was also revealed that Democrats in battleground states such as PA and NY committed election fraud by dropping Bernie Sanders voters off of voter rolls and indictments are now resulting.  Yes. State and local election leaders conspired to identify, and purge, Bernie supporters so they could note vote. We knew it was happening because on EVERY state primary voting day, Bernie supporters would post - in tears and anger - that they were turned away at the polls after a lifetime of voting without any issues.  Election analysts are now stating Bernie would have won the primaries had it not been for the DNC rigging and election fraud, and he would have easily beat Trump at the polls.  It's been a long, hard road for Bernie supporters, being attacked for demanding the truth and fair elections. Being attacked for refusing to vote for a candidate who would do anything within her power to win, no matter how illegal and unethical, including stripping us of fair elections.  I won't lie. It feels good to be vindicated. But sad as well.  Look no further than Hillary for giving us Donald Trump. And that my friends, is a FACT. Meg Bones",

These people spend their LIVES inventing reasons as to why \"Good Guys\" NEED guns.  The answer is the \"Bad Guys.\"  (BTW, with the same guns).  Well . . .   Here's a list of people the \"Good Guys\" FAILED to save.  With the SAME. Fucking. Guns.  WHILE the \"Bad Guys\" pretty much had run of the show.  Kids attending their High School homeroom class.  The Teachers of that exact same class.  Boyfriends, Girlfriends.  Dad's & Sons.  College Kids on their night out away from home, out to see \"The Dark Knight.\"  Out to see, what a REAL hero, looks like.  Children . . . Who hadn't even reached double digits, nor honestly could even count to that many without help from a grownup.  Kids goin' to college in Sunny CA.  People who wanted nothing more but to see a show, in the town BUILT to escape All Worries.  Damn Near Everybody.  In a building made for \"Untouchable Christianity\".   Including an 18 monthyo who'd never be able to honestly answer the question of what she'd ever done wrong to anyone?  Y'all \"Good Guys\".  FAILED.  With the exact same available devices . . .   So when I see . . . This . . . \"Don't punish the good guy for the sake of the bad\" with a black eye induced by a crazed neighbor, I wonder where the disconnect between where his money and his mouth is?  He's totally fine with everyone else just KILLING their problems to death, but then why didn't he take the same course of action?  Why didn't he just shoot her?  Most importantly, why is it that they NEVER have answers that make sense?  Strong Hint: $$$$$$$$$$$$$",
