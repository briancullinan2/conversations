        "description": "Wade Roberts Green Party Candidate For State Rep MI 109th Now here's one of the issues that  differentiates me from my opponents in this race.  Cambensy hasn't taken a position on CR 595, which is safe.  There's no money for it now anyway and the EPA isn't budging without an expensive protracted legal battle.   Rich Rossway , who is against raising any taxes is going to fight for the 100 million dollar road through environmentally sensitive wilderness and wetlands. ...  If Marquette County can afford to spend 100 million on county roads, I support rebuilding some existing county roads and a drive from Little Lake to Carlsend and on towards US 41 from either direction would convince most there's a definite need.  As for spending 100 million of public funds to shorten the route of the mining interests looting the precious metals beneath what is yours and mine; I am opposed to it.    The State of Michigan should have cut a much better deal to begin with and there's no sense in giving them an even better deal by spending another 100 million shortening their haul with the billions they're trucking out of the UP.   http://michiganradio.org/…/mining-what-does-state-get-return   See More",

        "description": "‎ Karen Weidner ‎   to   Marcia Squier In Japan, gun homicides are so rare the likelihood of dying by firearm is equal to an American’s chance of being killed by lightning.   Still, President Donald Trump encourages people to look to guns as a means of protection. In a speech Monday, Trump called the Texas shooting a “mental health problem” not a “guns problem.” But Japan has almost eradicated gun crime in the country by putting requirements on gun sales that are similar to driver’s tests.   To own a gun in the country, a citizen must attend an all-day class and perform at least 95 percent on a shooting-range test, as well as pass a written exam. They’re also required to pass drug tests and mental health tests. In 2014 there were just six gun deaths in Japan, while there were 33,599 in the United States. At the same time, off-duty police aren’t permitted to carry their firearm, and when they must subdue a suspect, they use a combination of martial arts or striking weapons, Business Insider reported.   Still, Trump wants to see more guns.",
