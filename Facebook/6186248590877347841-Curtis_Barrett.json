I am willing to move on that depending on the opportunity or if they don't plan on using the full breadth of my expertise.  I have spent 6 years working for startups, so that means working nights and weekends and being \"on call\" pretty much 100% of the time.  If there is a more comfortable 9-5 position I would be happy with the lower end of that.",
