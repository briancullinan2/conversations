I think the argument you used is that it is not independently reproducible (e.g. multiple sources repeating the same result) if all copies of the bible were destroyed. To be honest, this in particular didn't bother me that much, but I'm emotionally exhausted from getting into otherwise pointless Facebook debates about the bible as God's word or my faith. I felt like I had done everything I could to share with you, so at that point it was kind of the 'straw that broke the camels back' moment as I didn't think there was any chance I was ever going to change your mind and didn't want to waste time debating it - well that and I've seen enough criticism of my faith from others that I just don't have the emotional energy to invest in repeated discourse if I don't see it going. My removal of you as a 'Facebook friend' in no way meant that I don't still very much consider you a real life friend, although I can see how it could be interpreted that way in today's social media world - this was really just meant as a way to filter people from posting critical comments on things I share (or I comment on) if, after repeated attempts, I don't think the argument will be worth either of our times or fruitful."

I guess I’ll find out and ask Jesus. \n\nWhat I can say is animals were part of God’s perfect creation on the earth before Adam sin and brought death into the world. Before the fall of man, there was no death and mankind were vegetarian. \n\nIt was only after the curse of sin fell upon the world that animals are one another. And after Noah’s flood resources were scarce and man resorting to eating animals. \n\nThe creative order God established in Genesis does indicate that man, created in God’s image, is above lower creation (animals), but below him. All plants and animals were given to man by God to be stewards. \n\nHaving said that, there are laws in the OT and NT that are very specific in the humans killing of animals - be it for sacrifices or food. \n\nAlso, in the NT, teaching is given not to judge others for not eating meat (for conscience or health reasons) and not to judge others for eating it. \n\nLastly, shat I can also say is that Revelation talks about the lion and the lamb laying together in the field in the new heaven and new earth. \n\nOnce sin has been eliminated through Jesus and Satan and his demons and all who belong to him are cast into the lake of fire, death of all kinds will cease to exist. There will be no need to kill animals for food and God will be our supply."

You’re (and many Christian offshore cults like Mormons) use this definition to assume you can eventually become a God or like God if you ‘evolve’ enough or get smart enough. \n\nIt was the first sin and lie ever told:\n\nSatan to Eve:\n “If you eat of the fruit of this tree, you’ll be as Gods”"

That’s the first common ground we seem to have so far. \n\nBut do you understand the world (and everyone in it) has a sin problem that caused us to be separated from God? \n\nAnd, as the perfect, righteous judge of the universe, he could sentence us all to eternal death and suffering and he’d be just for doing so? But in his great mercy for humanity humbled himself, took on human flesh, lived a perfect life and gave himself over to die (and rise) so he could set us free? \n\nAnd that eternal forgiveness, eternal life, and a relationship with him as a loving father is available to anyone who believes in him and worships him as Lord?"
