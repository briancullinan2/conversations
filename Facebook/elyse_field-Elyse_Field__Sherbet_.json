I know we joke around a lot, but a 2 and a half year relationship sounds pretty serious.  I think you deserve a great guy that meets your every want and need.  So I encourage you to really evaluate your relationship, maybe even list out all the Pros and Cons, just to be sure that you aren't making a mistake.  I am sure you won't be single for very long, you are quite a catch!  I am here to talk to if you need anything.\n"
