I'm curious if you're willing to assist in making appropriate connections with/for me, regarding some grand projects I've in store (inventions, software concepts, and essentially \"supernatural abilities\" I have developed routines for), that are simply awaiting the proper attention while I R&D them further. Thanks! :)\n",
