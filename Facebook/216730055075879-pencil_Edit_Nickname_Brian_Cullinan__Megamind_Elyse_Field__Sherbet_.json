I don't know if you'll be in Tempe for new years but if you are and you want something to do, then I'd like to invite you to The Fiesta Bowl Mil ave block party for new years.  Tickets are $16 at safeway (if bought ahead of time) and $20 at the door. We will be pre-gaming at my place where you can park and take the free orbit bus down there and back. They have some notable electronic dj's on the band lineup like Josh Evans and Gabriel & Dresden.
