Right?  I mean the whole idea is based on not being breakable and u know,  I am old and prob not even considered a real hacker any more as all the greats I knew are ...from a different era. BUT I do know this,  there is no such thing as unhackable,  some of the greatest documented hacks (hilarious as they be) hacked the unhackable.  Or if someone finds a mathematical flaw of some sort.... (beyond me)....Stealth Drones,  GPS,  Bank of America, IRS,  etc etc etc.  I am just curious because no one seems to have considered this point which would make this a very short term bubble sort of thing.  I just hope they don't put too many trillions into it.  Correct me if I am wrong,  this is not my ...thing.....",
