Aside from a Nanching trainer on static display, there was only one other aircraft on the apron of any interest -- a Consolidated PBY4. The marine helicopters were fun to watch as they hovered then flew off, but that was it for static displays. The Route 66 Car Club was well represented with many beautiful customs and restorations, but to lable this as an air show or fly in, was a real stretch. Sadly, the last time I'll waste my time on this non-event.",

            "Details For the first time ever, join Joel Hodgson, creator of the critically acclaimed  Mystery Science Theater 3000  TV show and its new host Jonah Heston (Jonah Ray) as they bring the first live touring production of “MST3K” to the historic Orpheum Theatre, in downtown Phoenix, on the “Watch Out for Snakes!” Tour.     Appearing with Joel and Jonah live on stage will be robot companions Crow (Hampton Yount), Tom Servo and Gypsy, along with Synthia (Rebecca Hanson) and her Bonehead henchmen. Of course, it wouldn’t be “MST3K” without the ever-present surveillance of the Mads, Kinga Forrester (Felicia Day) and TV’s Son of TV’s Frank (Patton Oswalt), checking up on their unwilling test subjects via a video screen.     The tour ...  consists of a completely unique show. Each event will include all the things expected from an “MST3K” experience: a cheesy B-movie, hilarious riffing, wisecracking robots, silly sketches, plus – for the first time – audience participation! Show # 1 is the MST3K favorite “Eegah,” featuring all-new riffs and sketches.    Following its record-breaking #BringBackMST3K Kickstarter campaign, the new season of the show launched on April 14, 2017, exclusively on Netflix. The two live shows are written by the cast and writers of the new Netflix Original Series, which has earned a critics’ rating of 100% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.. The New York Times hails, “At last, a revival of something actually worth reviving… a different cast but the same outlook and style — and mercifully, the same reliable, giddy humor.”  “MST3K is just as hilarious as ever in rebooted form, turning its bemused eye on old, schlocky fare for some good, old-fashioned riffing,” raves Vanity Fair. And Nerdist says “The references are updated, the sets are snazzier, but the heart and soul of MST3K certainly remains intact.”      Tickets for “MST3K” “Watch Out for Snakes!” Live at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix will go on sale to the public Friday, May 19 at noon local time via  AXS.com  and the venue box office at  phoenix.ticketforce.com , or by calling 877-840-0457.

            "Details This meditation will cleanse our minds and work with set intentions. In this meditative gong bath we allow the gong sound to bring the healing and integration of our body, mind, and soul.    The gong is a powerful healing sound. Gong sends waves that are a combination of overtones and undertones. It creates deep relaxation, freeing us from the flood of thoughts our mind releases, and stimulates the glandular system to a higher level of functioning. It affects the physical nervous system, not just hearing it through the ears, but the sensation of feeling it on the skin. The gong sound vibrates the energy meridians in the body and brings them into balance. Kundalini energy, which begins at the base of the spine is  ... released, traveling upwards along the spine through the body. Sound travels and the body picks up a sound. It’s also a cleansing process for the subconscious mind. During the gong meditation, emotional transformation is produced as it reduces tension, releases blocks and stimulates circulation. The result is a reorganization of the emotional energy and feelings that are tied into the body structure. The gong changes feelings that are blocked by cutting the thoughts that sustain and recreate the feelings. During the gong bath let the entire body relax and let the sound of the gong penetrate the body and guide the mind.    * Wear comfortable clothing    * Bring mat &/or blanket to lie down on    * Hydrate before & after the gong; helps nerve function & cleansing of body    ~Welcoming Niki Shields to serenade the space     $15 before 6/23  $20 drop~in      The Gong is the spirit song. It is the primal whisper of the soul. Its sound is the echo of the Original Word that created the world, the sound within all sounds. ~Yogi Bahjan   See More Health ⋅ Wellness Meditation Yoga",

            "Details Hey Everyone!  As always, this a FREE event with no promotional associations, going strong since 2007!   However, we have 300 needy familys that need suppport,  so toy donations are greatly appreciated! In addition, our perfromers make this a very spcial event and put life and limb at risk for you.     Route Posting  Its been a slow buildup this year but it looks bigger than expected so here we go. Since the preparty is at the hotel lets just get started    STOP 1 7:00-8:00  Old Town Gringos ($3 Corona/PBR)  Rock Bar ($ 4 fireball and Xmas shot)    Then split into two routes like last year due to the high number of attendees.    ...  STOP 2 8:00-9:00  ROUTE A: Pattys ($3 domestics)  Old Town Tavern (TBA) little harder to find but cool.  Overflow ideas: The Grape Vine    ROUTE B: Kelly's (TBA)  Two Brothers Tap House (1/2 off apps, $3 beers)  Overflow ideas: Montauk, Diego Pops    STOP 3 9:00-10:00  ROUTE A  Giligins ($7 PBR, Coors, MIller pitchers, $3 Kamikazies)  Social Tap ($4 domestic & well drinks)    ROUTE B  Boondocks ($5 well, wine, drafts)  Goodwood ($3 PBR, Jack Fire and Honey)  Overflow ideas: djs    FINAL STOPS/ AFTERPARTY:  10:00 and on  Wasted Grain (TBA) Has expanded into parking lot and will feature amazing aerial performances!  INTL ($5 well & $3 beer) shake your booty all night    Twisting the holiday paradigm until it screams for mercy is fun! Getting arrested is not. Santa Claus is friendly, respectful, and cooperative with police officers, security guards, bouncers, and store owners and doesn't break any laws! \"Disorderly Conduct\" is not a merit badge. Have your own special twisted fun, but don't fuck it up for the rest of us! Our santas do not destroy property, steal merchandise, or do harm to others. The authorities and local businesses usually take Santa's antics in the loving holiday spirit Santa intends, so be nice to them. Seriously - don’t argue. If they don’t want Santa there, Santa should move along.    REMEMBER THE ANSWER IS: SANTA    Who's in charge? SANTA  Who are you with? SANTA  What organization are you with? SANTA  Who organized this? SANTA  Who just snap chatted a picture of their junk to me? SANTA    *****    Bring ID  Bring cash for drinks (don't forget the tip!).  Bring cell phone. Look for updates on this event page.  Bring comfy shoes and warm clothes.  Bring candy and crap for the patrons we meet.  Bring a camera.  Bring your loud ass and your singing pipes.  Bring your Santarchy Carol Book            ************* more info ************************    YOU MUST BE IN FULL CHRISTMAS COSTUME!  Slacks and a hat are *NOT* Christmas costume. An ugly sweater is DEFINITELY NOT Christmas costume. There are events for that stuff, but this event is not one of them.       This is very important. You will be a Santa in a huge group of  Santas. Lines at some bars will be long. This is inevitable, though  we have tried our best to mitigate this as much as possible. Do not bring outside drinks into any bar or restaurant. And remember that drinking alcohol on the streets is illegal. Santa does not have any special permits or permission to be exempt from these laws.    Finally, by showing up, you acknowledge that being Santa can be risky business. You accept all consequences that could potentially arise from your personal participation and any participation of others which may affect you.   See More",

            "Details 21+ / 8pm doors/ ONLY $5!  River Whyless -  RIVERWHYLESS.COM  Asheville, North Carolina's River Whyless is a band much like that titular body of water - a mingling of currents, a flow of time and physical space, all brought together in a murmuring sense of purpose. It is the expression of a group of musicians, three of which are songwriters, who have played together in various forms since their college days in the North Carolina mountains. Their forthcoming EP, their first release since their 2012 debut album, is the next evolution of the band's collective voice.    Composed of Ryan O'Keefe (guitars, vocals), Halli Anderson (violin, vocals), Alex McWalters (drums, percussion) and Daniel Shearin (bass, vocals, harmon ... ium, cello, banjo), the band is preparing to release a self-titled EP, their first effort since 2012, on January 20th.    (\"Like Fleet Foxes, River Whyless have a contemplative, relaxed style. The instrumentation weaves together seamlessly, a high point being Anderson’s violin playing, and the band’s soothing harmonies.\" ~ Bruce Warren, WXPN    “Hailing from the mountains of NC, River  Whyless puts a hauntingly sweet spin on traditional  foundations. ” -Michael, Bandcamp Staff Pics)    The Blenders-    David Strackany-   See More",

            "Details The Arizona Animal Welfare League & SPCA's Walk to Save Animals 2k & 5k walk is a tradition for many Phoenix residents and AAWL alumni families. This family and pet-friendly event is AAWL's largest annual fundraiser, bringing out more than 3,000 people and dogs to help raise funds for the thousands of homeless and medically in-need animals AAWL rescues.      By registering to participate as an individual or a team in the 2015 Walk to Save Animals, you are directly helping to care for more than 4,500 homeless pets that come into AAWL's shelter each year. The funds raised at this event allow AAWL to save animals at risk of euthanasia, provide medical care to sick or injured animals, provide additional behavior training to make pets more adoptable, and much more.    The Walk to Save Animals is more than just a 2k & 5k fun run! Participants can shop pet related vednors, gather tons of freebies for fido in the Pet Club Market, win prizes, view demostrations like flyball and agility, enjoy refreshments, experience fun activities with your furry family members, and much more! Bring the entire family and spend the day at Tempe Town Lake helping to save lives.    Walk as an individual or a team! Sign up today,  http://bit.ly/1NCNYDR      #WalktoSaveAnimals",

Please, please let us know what we can do to help..I personally think we could maybe all chip in $10 or $20 buckaroos (or more;) for all the food?? And those of us that live here with kitchens can def bring stuff (or stop and get it  at krogers..haha;)  Also  Patti LeGendre Lehman  and I were talking,  along with my mom, and we'd love to do some special things ... , like maybe some \"Cullinan Clan\" tshirts? Mom suggested maybe they could be in dif colors (1 for each original child), to help denote which branch everyone falls under!!:) I am happy to get them ordered, I have a few wholesale lines from my store, so I could get the t's and then maybe y'all help pay for printing?  Under $10 for sure! I'll do some research, or if you're local and know of some cheap local print/design shops?   Would also love to do a video/slide show that maybe Dick Stegmiller could help with again?   Shane Stegmiller  can you ask your dad?  Then maybe we could all find picks of the original kids, and the whole branch of each family? Let me know!  I also have a ton a of goodies, so we'll do some \"swag bags\" for everyone (ie-bags of goodies;). If you have anything you'd like to add, let me know!  Finally, I put the link for the reunion on the CullinanFamily Facebook page..so if you haven't \"liked\" it yet, please do and add your own pics and stories, etc.  Ps..my mom's bday is this month..we may bring a cake, if that's ok, Jim, but if any of you want to reach out-feel free! I always show her all the bday wishes for her on my page!   Can't wait to see everyone!   Sorry for hoggin the page!!!!   See More",

Today, the most effective ways to detect breast cancer early are to have yearly mammograms starting at age 40 and to have regular breast exams by a doctor or nurse. Some things that may reduce a woman’s risk of getting breast cancer include being physically active, staying at a healthy weight, and limiting alcohol use",

                "description": "Renee' Taylor Who is at risk?  Gender  Being a woman is the greatest risk factor for breast cancer; however, men also can develop breast cancer.  Age  The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. About 2 out of 3 invasive breast cancers are found in women age 55 or older. ...  Heredity  Breast cancer risks are higher among women with a family history of the disease. Having a first-degree relative with breast cancer increases a woman’s risk, while having more than one first-degree relative who has   or had breast cancer before the age of 40 or in both breasts increases a woman’s risk even more. However, it’s important to remember that most women with breast cancer don’t have a first-degree relative with the disease.  Other risk factors  Post-menopausal hormone therapy with estrogen and progesterone therapy  Overweight or obesity, especially excessive weight gain after menopause  More than one alcoholic drink daily  Physical inactivity  Long menstrual history  Never having children or having first live birthafter age 30  Previous chest radiation to treat a different cancer  Previous history of breast cancer or certain benign breast conditions  Quality-of-life issues  From the time of diagnosis, the quality of life for every cancer patient and survivor is affected in some way.They may be affected socially, psychologically, physically, and spiritually.Concerns that patients and survivors most often express are fear of recurrence; chronic and/or acute pain; sexual problems; fatigue; guilt for delaying screening or treatment, or for doing things that may have caused the cancer; changes in physical appearance; depression; sleep difficulties; changes in what they are able to do after treatment; and the burden on finances and loved ones. Women with breast cancer often feel uncertainty about treatment options and have concerns about their fatigue, sexuality, and body image.   See More",

                "description": "Renee' Taylor Detection  The earlier breast cancer is found, the better the chances for successful treatment. A mammogram can often show breast changes that may be cancer before physical symptoms develop. Some cancers that aren’t   seen on a mammogram may still be felt by a woman or her health care provider. For this reason, the American Cancer Society recommends the following guidelines for finding breast cancer early:  Women age 40 and older should have a mammogram every year and should con ... tinue to do so for as long as they’re in good health.  Women in their 20s and 30s should have a clinical breast exam (CBE) by a health professional at least every 3 years. After age 40, women should have a CBE every year.  Women should know how their breasts normally look and feel and report any breast change to a health care provider right away. Breast self-examination (BSE) is an option for women starting in their 20s.  Screening MRI is recommended for women at high risk of breast cancer, including women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, those with a lifetime risk of breast cancer of about 20% to 25% or greater according to risk assessment tools that are based mainly on family history, those with a known breast cancer gene mutation, and women who were treated for Hodgkin disease.

Lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol use, breast-feeding, engaging in   regular physical activity, and staying at a healthy weight, are all associated with lower risk. Estrogen-blocking drugs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in some high-risk women.   Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age, race, family history of disease, and reproductive history.",

He said first if we go to Vegas we should eat a this place Komex, it's suppose to be pretty awesome. A little ways off the strip. And if we are ready to sleep by Vegas. Which it seems like we would be around there when it's time to go to sleep. We could camp at red rocks outside of Vegas. If we plan ahead with tents, this might be good. If we leave at 7:30pm ish we will get to Vegas around 11pm hang out there for a bit and then camp outside at the red rock. Get up the next morning and if we have time do a little hike. Then head to Mammoth. And he said we should go to the Hot Springs outside of mammoth on the east side of the 395. So bring your Swim Suits just in case, I would say.",

Snow levels run from mainly above 7,000 to 8,000 feet or so at first, with very heavy snow above this elevation (probably 3 to 5 feet) through Friday). Late Friday we see snow levels drop, and all areas get hit with heavy snow through the weekend. This trend will continue into and through the following week. CM ",

            "Details It is time once again for that most important holiday of the year! I assume you all have already marked your calendars and asked for time off from work if needed. And now we must work together to organize hotel rooms and rides.    For those of you who haven't attended previously, you are obviously aware of the importance of this event, and have been informed that your attendance is of course mandatory.    Seriously. We'll unfriend you.    As in previous years, our own Mike Brooks will be giving a talk. I'll post the time and track number so that you can be sure not to miss it. Get there early, as last year I had to wait 10 minutes to sit on the floor along the back wall to hear Mike's talk. I hear there will be an ex ... tra 400 seats per track or something this year though.    Badges are $150 for males who want to attend talks. If you are a male who isn't interested in the talks, or can't afford a badge, there will still be much fun to be had, and you can sometimes borrow a badge from someone who isn't currently using it. Badges for females have previously turned out to be entirely optional. (The discrepancy here is in the hopes of creating more interest in the field among females, to discourage the gender disparity. That's totally the reason.)    In our previous experience, organizers seem very disinterested in enforcing drinking-age restrictions, and appear to do the legal minimum with regard to enforcement. Being under 21 should not be a major hurdle to participating in activities, even if alcohol is present.    Although I don't have a full list of events yet, the first event people are generally interested in attending is the toxic barbecue at ~6 PM on Thursday. The last event is the award presentation at ~2 PM on Sunday. These are optional events of course, and many will be arriving later or leaving earlier as needed. The times I listed above for the Facebook event should be good for capturing these two events. I, for example, will be leaving later, and might miss at least part of the toxic barbecue. I'm sure there are others who will want to work Friday, and not make it up until that night or Saturday morning. See discussion.    For those who really truly aren't interested in the technical stuff, I encourage you to let us try to change your mind at least a little bit. (Not even just a little lockpicking workshop? You'll have fun we swear!) But there are still lots of other things to do. There's drinking and partying of course. The Star Trek convention's that weekend too I think (but I have been misinformed on this point before). And, of course, it is VEGAS. :-) There's talk of Pen and Teller, which I think is in the same hotel as the convention this year actually... There will surely be swimming. And just like last year, we'll have a game of chasing drunk Travis around the city.     https://www.defcon.org/   See More",

Unfortunately, this is because of Americans, uneducated in the actual state of affairs, watching sensationalized news stories that omit any information that might trivialize the story in the slightest. Before thinking that this trip is unsafe, or believing others who claim that you shouldn't go for safety, go online and educate yourself. If someone tells you that it's not safe, ask them how they found out that it was unsafe. If it was from reports about drug violence on the news (yes, it was), then know that you can safely disregard their display of media-induced ignorance in favor of credible information, like the information provided in US State Department travel advisories.",

            "Details Jodorowsky’s Dune tells the stranger than fiction tale of the legendary filmmaker’s ill-fated adaption of Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel Dune – an unfinished epic dubbed “The Greatest Movie Never Made.”    Part of our month-long series, The Films of Alejandro Jodorowsky.  View the schedule at  http://tiny.cc/jodorowsky    “Marvelous and preposterously fascinating … allows audiences a rare glimpse inside the furiously creative mind of Jodorowsky.” – Frank Pavich, Austin Chronicle    In 1975, following the success of his wild cult films El Topo and The Holy Mountain, Jodorowsky began work on his most ambitious project yet. Starring his own 12 year old son Brontis alongside Orson Welles, Mick Jagger, David Carradine ...  and Salvador Dali, featuring music by Pink Floyd and art by some of the most provocative talents of the era, including HR Giger (who later designed the nightmarish look of Ridley Scott’s Alien) and Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, Jodorowsky’s adaptation of Frank Herbert’s beloved novel Dune was poised to change cinema forever. For two years, Jodo and his team of “spiritual warriors” worked night and day on the massive task of creating the fabulous world of Dune: over 3,000 storyboards, numerous paintings, incredible costumes, and an outrageous, moving and powerful script. In the words of Jodorowsky’s producer, Michel Seydoux, “It should have been enough. But it wasn’t.” Through interviews with legends and luminaries including Giger, Gary Kurtz (producer of Star Wars) and Nicolas Winding Refn (director of Drive), and an intimate and honest conversation with Jodorowsky himself filmed over the course of three years, director Frank Pavich’s film – featuring never-before-seen realizations of Jodo’s mind- blowing psychedelic space opera – finally unearths the full, unbelievable saga of the Dune that never was.

Why is it, though, that the premier place on campus to 'hear' people can't provide adequate sound technology. I had the same problem when I saw Thomas Friedman there a few weeks ago. The clip on mikes didn't work well and they were handed regular microphones that were no better. The closed caption feature helped some, but overall I missed quite a bit. I have hearing aids and the sound was thin, indistinct and very narrowly localized in the middle of the stage, all surrounded by this magnificent acoustically, designed interior. Is that the best that can be done?",

We're writing to request your organization’s endorsement of the upcoming Healthcare Justice March and to invite you to become a partner in our mission to see H.R. 676, the Expanded & Improved Medicare for All Act become law, establishing a truly universal, tax-supported, fully comprehensive and equitable healthcare system in the United States. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205205845439736&set=o.333894666673291&type=1&theater  We now have over 250 group and individua ... l endorsers including Nation of Change; Bold Blue; Labor Campaign for Single-Payer Healthcare; Unite Women; Progressive Democrats of America’s Healthcare Is a Human Right issue group, PNHP chapters in California, South Carolina, Western Washington; Poor Peoples’ Economic Human Rights Campaign; SPAN-Ohio and Healthcare for All chapters in California, Oregon, Maryland, Texas, and South Carolina. The complete list is available at  http://healthcarejusticemarch.org/?page_id=70  and is updated daily.  We are grateful for each and every person and organization who has endorsed us, but the fact is that in order to make the March as impactful as it can be, we need more! The recent Peoples’ Climate March had over 800 supporters who not only endorsed, but mobilized their members and helped in other ways to make that march a success. As one of their endorsers, DUH was awed by their results and we hope to follow their example with the Healthcare Justice March!  If your organization would like to endorse the March, go to  http://healthcarejusticemarch.org/?page_id=30  If your organization is able to donate time, skills, goods, services, or money to the cause or can gather a group of volunteers to help at the event, please email us at hjm4all@gmail.com.  For our “wish list” of people, services, and things we know we need, go to  http://healthcarejusticemarch.org/?page_id=453 .  Thank you for considering being a part of healthcare history and for all you and your organization do to create the reality we want to see.

Just a reminder post as people are wishing me a Happy Birthday on the 22nd, the get together at Tanzy in the lounge is for Wednesday the 23rd anytime from 7:30pm until I'm too drunk to walk!!! (Which won't take long, so I'll have to pace myself!) Since I just quit my job, everyone pays for themselves - if you wanna drink, drink; if you wanna eat, eat; SO everyone pays their own way and that's GIFT enough to have you all there!!!!!!!!!!! It's about having fun for a change - I don't do that very often. Let's celebrate all the possibilities in my future!!! AND you can all meet my hubby from New Jersey who is in town!!!  ;-)  I can't wait to see everyone on Wednesday!!!!   <3",

We are going to be brewing a beer (the style of which is still up for vote!), the brewing process of takes about four hours (most of it partying), then it will need to ferment for a few weeks and then it will be drinkable in about a months time. So this is your chance to see how its done and participate in the brew process!   We currently have a vanila porter ready to drink and we'll be enjoying it at the party!  We'll also make some dinner, maybe grill something..",

So we can try to get an ok camping spot, plus for all this work that it takes to setup something like this, I would like to be down there for 2 nights at least. But if people are leaving right after 5pm it might be better to go as a group, then we could setup together, and cross the lake together. Last time I was there I didn't get Cell Se ... rvice, so sticking together as much a possible is a good idea.   I have an ice chest, 1 huge tent, a stove, 3 cans of small propane bottles, pots and pans (mess kit), and 5 or 6 sleeping bags.   what i would like people to make sure they bring: swim suite!!, sun screen, eggs?, milk? bacon?, pancake mix (if someone has some), small med kit that includes ibuprofen, personal light.   Let me know who would like to ride with me or whatever.   See More",

Also drinks. And water (lots of water).  Everyone should bring at least 1 cup (for drinks, including coffee or hot chocolate) and possibly a second or a bowl (for cereal/oatmeal and such).

Please update your going status with your decision on the matter ASAP, and if you need anything please let us know so we can find extras within the group.  We will send cars to the campsite as people are available starting Friday and will be leaving the site as people desire on Sunday. ...  I would still like to do a few group meals but it is highly recommended that everyone bring snacks and water. The details of group meals will be handled outside of Facebook, but feel free to post request and suggestions.

Hopefully anyone walking this weekend will be done by Friday evening. :-)    Ben's suggestion is that we plan our meals in advance. Sounds like a lovely idea, but I dunno if any of us has both the ability to cook AND the ability to plan in advance.    Nearly the whole way will be by vehicle (of one form or another), so no need to backpack. We can pack a bit heavier (big group meals and ice chest and stuff).    Invite anybody I forgot! (I've gone through my friends list like 4 times over the course of today, and am very tired of staring at it, so don't feel bad if I missed you...)",

            "Details Flagstaff Cultural Partners and the Artists’ Coalition of Flagstaff are excited to present the 10th Annual Recycled Art Exhibition with a free opening reception held on April 7, 2012 from 6:00-9:00pm. Bring the entire family for an evening of art, food, and a live circus act!     In the Center’s theater, performances will take place throughout the evening. The feature entertainment will be provided by Flagstaff’s premier circus troupe, Circus Bacchus. They will be playing music on instruments made from recycled materials and wearing costumes all made from recycled materials. There will be trapeze, fire dancing, stilt walking, hula hooping, a strong man and more! The full Circus Bacchus band will fill the gallery  ... with their funky tunes! Visit them on the web at  http:// www.circusbacchus.org/ .     Awards will be presented at the reception to artwork entries in the exhibition for Most Creative, Most Humorous, Most Useful, Best Use of Material, Elegance, Simplicity, and Best of Show. A People’s Choice award will be announced at the close of the exhibition. All visitors to the exhibition will have a chance to vote for the People’s Choice award.      The Recycled Art show is organized every year through a partnership with Flagstaff Cultural Partners, the Artists’ Coalition of Flagstaff, and the City of Flagstaff. All artwork in the show must contain at least 80% recycled or reused materials. The possibilities are endless, and the exhibition is a testament to the creativity of the artists and community of Coconino County. The purpose of the exhibition is to encourage the reuse of a variety of materials in new, different, and creative forms and to promote recycling and resource conservation.     Artists will offer workshops and demonstrations to the public on creating recycled works each Saturday throughout the run of the exhibition. These will take place on April 14, 21, 28, and May 5 and 12. A full list of workshops will be posted soon on  culturalpartners.org/ recycled.htm .     The exhibition will run from April 10 – May 12, 2012 at the Coconino Center for the Arts, located at 2300 N. Fort Valley Road, Flagstaff. The Gallery is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 11:00am-5:00pm. Admission is free. For more information, visit  culturalpartners.org/ recycled.htm  or call (928) 779-2300.   See More",

            "Details Sounds like people want to do a Mexico trip again this year! That's good, cause Mexico trips are awesome. We discussed going somewhere besides Puerto Peñasco this year, but travel time and cost seem to be limiting factors. If anyone has ideas, let me know.    The earliest I can leave is Wednesday night. Also, Thursday morning, Thursday night, and Friday morning would work, depending on everybody's schedule. Thoughts?    They say you need a passport. They've been saying that for years. We haven't had a problem yet. It's up to you if you don't want to risk it, but so far we've made it through every time.    As for safety, the area we're going is extremely safe. The US State Department travel advisory for Puerto Peñasco says you shouldn't drink and drive, and should be careful of road conditions on dirt roads. The State Department specifically endorses our route as well.    You should come! It will be fun!",

            "Details ***THIS WEEK AND THIS WEEK ONLY UK THURSDAY MOVES TO WEDNESDAY TO NOT INTERRUPT YOUR TURKEY DAY PLANS WITH SPECIAL GUESTS: URBAN ASSAULT (aka Faust & Shortee)***    Urban Assault (aka Faust & Shortee) have been a powerhouse in the DJ/Production world for the last 16+ years electrifying audiences on a global scale. Specializing in the grimy beats & filthy bass line genres of Dubstep, Drum & Bass, Drumstep and Electro House, this dynamic duo continues to awe masses worldwide both in the studio & on stage complete with live 4 turntable DJ trick sets scratched to perfection.      Ranked as one of the top 5 Turntablists in the world by SPIN Magazine, Faust released the first turntablist album in history, the critically  ... lauded Man Or Myth and continues to push the boundaries of his production today in various genres. Shortee is acknowledged as one of the most diverse, technically skilled female DJs in the world, described as “The World’s Premier Female DJ” by the Grammy Foundation and named “Queen of the Scratch World” by DJ Times.     Both were featured in the award-winning documentary “SCRATCH” (Palm Pictures) marking their historical contribution to the art of DJing and Turntablism. Together their solo & team albums have earned them critical acclaim in major publications like SPIN, URB, Remix, Knowledge, ATM, DJ Times, Rolling Stone etc., while their music is featured on networks such as MTV, NBC, CNN, HBO, ESPN and more.     In addition to rocking stages globally, Faust & Shortee are constantly in the studio producing music for release on various record labels as well as their own imprints. They successfully run two multi-genre labels: Heavy Artillery Recordings (House / Drum & Bass / Breaks / House / Dubstep / Drumstep) and 5 Star Records (Hip Hop / Battle / DJ Tools). Their original tunes and remixes frequent the Top10 charts on the regular and some have held the #1 spot for weeks at a time. A few of their most popular Heavy Artillery EPs include “Scarface”, “Kid Dynomite”, “Lose Control” and “Dope” and their tune “Away” was nominated for the ‘Best Jungle/D&B track’ in the 2008 International Dance Music Awards. In addition, their infamous “Red Raider” EP, held the #1 spot on both Beatport & TrackItDown and was ranked as one of TrackItDown’s Top10 Drum & Bass releases of 2009, alongside such artists as Sub Focus, Deadmau5, Chase & Status, Noisia, DJ Fresh and The Prodigy, and it still continues to return to the charts time & time again today.     Whether they appear as ‘Faust & Shortee’ or disguised as the grimy “Urban Assault”, the bass line is always front and center.

He is a unique performer that engages his audience with massive stage presences and vocal abilities like no other. REDNEKs sound consists of head destroying baselines with original intricate edits and even though he has only been making Dubstep since May 2011 don’t be fooled, he has 18 years of hard studio time under his hat. The true nature of the name “redneck” means grafter. This is why they call him REDNEK...

            "Details The trees are changing!  The most beautiful place I know of to watch the trees change in Arizona is Hart Prairie.  We should all go there, and have a picnic!    If you want, bring a blanket, and some picknicky food to share.    DRESS VERY WARMLY, and in layers.  If it's sunny and calm, it'll be warm.  If it's cloudy and windy, it could be VERY cold.  No chickening out though.  If it's too cold, or precipitizing, we'll eat inside the biggest car. :-)    A portion of the journey is on a well-maintained dirt road.  This is the most important part of the journey, and a VERY scenic drive.  However, it has snowed there recently, and the road may be muddy, or have a little snow in shady spots.  If you're not comfortable on  ... dirt roads, or don't think you have the car for it, you might want to either arrange to carpool with someone else, or park at the turnoff and let another car shuttle you in.  We should pile into as few cars as possible anyway, just to save gas.  And you'll have a lot more fun if you have others to share this drive with!    The location you get when you Google \"Hart Prairie\" is correct, though Google's route in has less dirt-road driving and is less scenic than the one I recommend.  Take 180 up, past the Snowbowl turnoff.  Exit right on Hart Prairie Road (Forest Service road 151).  Take it about 5 miles in.  Hart Prairie is the large, beautiful, golden prairie on the left.  Make it a loop by taking fire road 294 back to 180.  35°19'59.03\"N, 111°44'31.59\"W    Or just carpool with me!   See More",
