        "description": "Alissa de la Mar  shared  TYT Politics 's  video . This b.s. election is just a corporate distraction from the real issues that are happening and need to be dealt with RIGHT NOW. These are American people, taking a stand for the good of america. We owe it to the land itself, and the natives and all the  people who have allowed so much intrusion for so long just to create this corrupt country. Any corporation SHOULD NOT have the power to call in armed forces on ANYONE, especially people who are peaceful, unarmed, and trying to protect and preserve their sacred land and their own lives and the lives of their families. There are laws that protect peoples' land and rights to ownership, especially if you've occupied that land for a certain amount of of time, and these people have been there FOR EVER. They've already given up most of this country's land to \"the white man\" and his industry and watched it get poisoned and paved and turned to concrete and tar. They don't deserve this. They deserve respect and seniority.  Shame on anyone who has turned a blind eye to this, ESPECIALLY the government and anyone with any kind of authority to do something. Those police men should be imprisoned and the corporation should be immensely charged for brutality and attempted genocide. Fuck this stupid election, put your voice into what's real.",

Whether ice, snow, clouds, lakes, rain, rivers, oceans or glaciers; our entire existence is dependent on this beautiful, squishy, light-sustaining goodness.  On December 5th, thousands of veterans traveled to Oceti Sakowin Camp to stand in solidarity with the strong community of water protectors already there opposing the construction of Dakota Access Pipeline. It was quite cold & windy this day as a powerful blizzard moved into the area. This is their story. This is our stand.  |•Mni Wiconi  4K version:  https://vimeo.com/196359073  Dispatch 1:  https://www.facebook.com/LucasMullikin/videos/vb.1115430205/10208203226934454/  Dispatch 3:  https://www.facebook.com/LucrativePictures/videos/730019123828423/  Dispatch 4:  https://www.facebook.com/LucrativePictures/videos/753759288121073/  Dispatch 5:  https://www.facebook.com/LucrativePictures/videos/843805489116452/  #mniwiconi #waterislife #standingrock #ocetisakowin Lucas Mullikin",
