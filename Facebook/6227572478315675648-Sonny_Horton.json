How do you distinguish between your closest friend, with whom you would trust the lives of your children in your absence or perhaps control of your finances during your incapacitation and your close acquaintance, with whom you would trust your home address but perhaps not a lot more? The degree of trust needs to be addressed - it is not binary. Makes for a great intellectual discussion and thought provoker üòÅ\n",
