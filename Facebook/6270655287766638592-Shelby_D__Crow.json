I wanted to take the initiative to find out if you might have an interest in hearing about an opportunity in Chandler, AZ that is potentially stronger than your current position. Do you have time for a quick call tomorrow morning on your way to work or in the afternoon? \nI look forward to hearing back. \nShelby\n"
