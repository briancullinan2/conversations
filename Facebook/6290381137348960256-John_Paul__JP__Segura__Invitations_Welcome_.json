While they are based out of Kansas City they would consider remote work options for the right candidate.\n\nWould you be interested in reviewing the formal job announcement? If so please let me know and I can get it over to you. It is a direct position with a small company with a great culture and growth potential. \nThank you,\nJP\n"
