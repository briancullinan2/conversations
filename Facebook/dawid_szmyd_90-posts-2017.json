There is this present live in... the 2005-2017(present) the entitled generation! Or better simply put \"im a artist!\" That can mean vastness of things. Being a narcissist selfish centered  no empathy wackadoo that fucks themselves in the mirror because  their so pretty. or better  ... yet  a musician... DJ? sample machine producer? Whinny privileged kid with effects processor?  \" oh everyone is a musician!\". How bout a bartender? What about maybe I'm a photographer? Hold on even better I'm a waiter? Most have  the same thing in common they don't understand  that thee concept of art is work! Sacrifice!  \"Art should be hard\"  when it's serving food and being the best waiter with seduction and charm that gets you that easy money of fame in the moment! Art is the process of progression created something out of nothing! \"From scratch! Wheather it's your identity or your medium of paint or lens  gear... it has to be from the core soul meaning what one tells a story of! So to my future kids this represents my competition and my environment on a grand scale. These days will be remembered as \"I'm somebody\" \"I'm artist\". Every time I hear it this face comes to mind! That's what I think about your self entitled celebertie somebodyness. So if you don't have a stellar resume as a person then don't wonder why I'm wide eyed laughing cuming at you! Identity crisis times! To all that aren't well you know what face we are.

Dark with only 3 glimmering lights f ... lickering. Tuck down and look into each one. At now they unveil themselves to be keyholes. Center beholds a mirage of sweets and chocolates on a glum dinner table rotting. One to the left reveals a blimped up of a hamster running in a circle Amongst his garnished golden plated Farris wheel. Right beholds a old hag being pampered by a young exotic soul to her side. You must not knock at either. Stand still. Very still till the sunsets above. The signal will be the hamster falling asleep. At this moment pinch your  lips together blow whistle. All the light keyhole beacons will go out. Clap you're hands 7times. Youll hear a collapse of wood.  Lights go on! Red velvet curtains surround. The chitter chatter of voices embark around you. The engulfment of many human fragrances reveal themselves. It will now look like You are in a squared velvet roomed curtain. Point west towards the sunset. Now Run fast towards that corner with arms  forward and eyes closed. I assure you if followed precisely, Your reward awaits past the vale.   See More",

        "description": "My American imagination first began with a Hint glimpse introduction of living puppets on TV.  Some where animals beating on drums while others where little devils whispering things in my conscious. Still to this day I feel they are alive every time I see them.  The majic power of a idea that came into formation by a man simply named Jim Hensen. Much different then a Mickey that was one dimensional ... .     Hats off to Charlie himself as those days there was not much laughter. Two great components of silent entertainment. All visual as far as I'm concerned. Maybe one day ill make a puppet and leave him in the woods. He  will come to life when I'm not around. A lot of untold majic happened at this studio and still is happening. When no one is around the puppets play. Keep that majic imagination alive for the next generation.   See More",
