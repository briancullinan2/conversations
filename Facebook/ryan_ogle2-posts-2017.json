Any of my family and friends who need to chat are welcome anytime . It's no good suffering in silence. I have cold drinks and food in the fridge...tea & coffee in the cupboard and I will always be here. ...You are never not welcome!!  Blue Monday is a name given to a day in January (typically the third Monday of the month) reported to be the most depressing day of the year and January the worst month for suicides, it's always good to talk but even better to listen. This hits closer to home than we think. I'll always lend an ear and a shoulder.......and my heart.  Could at least one friend, please copy and repost (not share)? I'm trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening.",

We must learn how to stick up for ourselves and speak out against injustices, both large and small.   But it does mean that people are going through their own struggles and hardships in life too. So always think beyond what you see. There is always more going on beneath the surface than what we first perceive.  On the contrary, always bear in mind that even though you may be   experiencing difficulties in your personal life, it doesn't give you the   right to treat others poorly. We are all trying to navigate our way   through the difficulties of this world as best as we can. And the journey is much easier when we work together, instead of against each other.

We may not have the power to control everything that happens to us, but we DO have a choice on how we react to it.

To live a happier life we need to work on our perspective and priorities. When I was younger I heard a beautiful parable on the topic of prioritizing the things that truly matter and decided to bring the message through the medium of video. I hope this inspires you and like the Professor says \" we can truly accomplish anything if we use out time wisely.\" Focus on what truly matters and life will have a way to be that much brighter and fulfilling.

It only seems like maybe 10 years ago when you were waiting for the school bus and then doing your homework at the dining room table.  There were so many happy memories.  I just can't get used to the idea that you're actually 30!! I'm so proud of all your accomplishments.  Keep up the good work! Don't be too impatient about meeting someone.  It's usually better to complete your education and get your finances in order.  I know life seems overwhelming at times, but I know you'll make the right choices!!!  Always remember Papa and I love you very much and you're always in our prayers.  :-)   :-)",
