        "description": "Marilyn J Bartlett Thanks for sharing,  Steve Kuusisto .  “At the level of higher education, the script is similar with a project designed to defund higher education, impose corporate models of governance, purge the university of critical thinkers, turn faculty into a low-wage army of part-time workers, and allow corporate money and power to increasingly decide course content and determine what faculty get hired. As public values are replaced by corporate values, students become clients, faculty are deskilled and depoliticized, tuition rises, and more and more working-class and poor minority students are excluded from the benefits of higher education. There are no powerful and profound intellectual dramas in this view of schooling, just the noisy and demonstative rush to make schools another source of profit for finance capital with its growing legion of bankers, billionaires, and hedge fund scoundrels.\"  Excerpt From:  “Neoliberalism's War on Higher Education.” iBooks.",

HEADS UP, from a friend:  Snopes has verified that the ACA enrollment period was shortened and 90% of the funding to advertise these deadlines has been cut. In addition (and astonishingly) the website for enrolling will be taken off-line every weekend. These tactics are intended to prevent enrollment and sink the ACA. Be sure to enroll on week days only! Enrollment for 2018 Affordable Care Act (ACA / Obamacare) starts November 1 and ends December 15. Trump reduced the advertising funds by 90% to announce when people can enroll.

If you watched and listened to the mayor's speech, her call for help, it was of desperation, not politics.  Excuse me, Mr. President but your tantrum tweet storm this morning attacking the mayor of San Juan, a fellow American citizen dealing with a real-time life and death struggle for hundreds of thousands of her constituents on an island of millions in crisis, is not only far below the dignity of the office you hold. It fails even the most basic test of humanity.  Did she have harsh words for your Administration's response to the aftermath of Hurricane Maria? Yes. It's called a reality check, and one that conforms to every firsthand account coming out of Puerto Rico no matter how much you try to deflect with your \"Fake News\" epithets. To take this personally is to put ego before country. And you also blame the Puerto Ricans themselves? That they want \"everything done for them\"? No. They just expect to be treated as any other American would.  I have seen more than my share of wretched desperation over the course of my career. I have reported from crisis zones where matters of life and death hang moment to moment in the balance between action and inaction, where communication is limited, and the sense of panic is building. I have seen the most steadfast of leaders feel the crushing weight of responsibility. as they survey a landscape of almost incomprehensible need.  It does not take a saintly amount of compassion or empathy to feel for those who are struggling to stay alive, who are worried for the fate of family and friends, and who have seen so much that they have known and loved blown and washed away. You swore to \"faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States\" and that means a responsibility to look out for all Americans, even if they live on an island in the ocean, or look different or even speak a different language than what you think is America.  I worry that whoever has your ear has not adequately impressed upon you the gravity of this situation, or even the political price you are likely to pay (although that can be no where near the top concern at the moment). Or perhaps you have been told and haven't listened.  Regardless, what Puerto Rico needs now is not rhetoric but help, not a bumbling response, but the precision and competence we expect of our government. I do not believe \"blame the victim\" is what Americans expect of their president.” - Dan Rather",

By all means answer if you can improve upon his thoughts.  I can't yet, but will keep thinking on it.  I was asked \"what would I have Congress do?\" Often that's a smokescreen for people who don't want to see any changes, but this friend was genuine. Here's how I replied:  I refuse to accept \"there's nothing we can do\" as an answer. How about:  - Reduce access to guns.  - Eliminate loopholes.  - Increase funding for mental health.  - Pass, and subject to Supreme Court review, reasonable restrictions to the Second Amendment whose rights cannot be absolute. As was observed many mass shootings ago, the First Amendment was deemed not to protect someone yelling \"fire\" in a crowded theatre but the Second Amendment protects those who would *open* fire in a crowded theater?!  If your didn't like my answers, I don't want to hear from you why they won't work. I want to hear from you what you think will work. And if you don't have any better answers than mine, either say \"I'm willing to give yours a chance\" or \"I'm ok with the way things are.\" Those are your choices. At least have the courage to state you believe this is the price for freedom. Probably a tough thing to say today so I'll give you until the next mass shooting to state your support for the status quo...but you better hurry.\"  Take heed.",

The White House is trying to sabotage the ACA since they can’t get a repeal bill passed, by shortening the enrollment period and cutting the marketing funds that would let you know about it.  Fortunately, your friends (like me) are posting this and using the word  congratulations  so it gets posted more frequently in Newsfeed by FB algorithms. PLEASE COPY AND PASTE (don't share) ON YOUR OWN TIMELINE. I'm adding a reminder that there will be only partial availability of the sign up sites on weekends.  Congratulations   if you share this !

As Rachel Maddow called it tonight: Pay attention to what is actually happening in the House of Representatives. The rest is DIVERSION, at this point!  While we are all sidetracked by Trump/Pence and the NFL, Trump vs. Puerto Rico, Harvey Weinstein & the Sexual Predation of All Hollywood, the Russian Hacking of the election, or the MLB American League Division Playoffs this week, it's worth noting that the following bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives:  1. HR 861 to Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency (Like to breathe? This one is not for you.)  2. HR 610 - Vouchers for Public Education (which may end free public education as we know it)  3. HR 899 to Terminate the Department of Education (which may lead to greater disparity between states but nobody who uses public education ever moves so it's all good)  4. HR 69 to Repeal the Rule Protecting Wildlife (nobody likes nature anyway, right?)  5. HR 370 to Repeal the Affordable Care Act (didn't we already try this umpteen times?)  6. HR 354 to De-fund Planned Parenthood (because exactly none of your tax dollars go toward abortion services)  7. HR 785 - National \"Right to Work\" (this one is actually a 'Right to fire you whenever your boss feels like it\" law, and it would effectively end unions)  8. HR 83 - Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill (California should just secede now and take all its money)  9. HR 147 to Criminalize Abortion (“Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act”) (because these private decisions should be made by your legislator and employer)  10. HR 808 to Impose Sanctions Against Iran (even though they are in compliance with the agreement according to those in the know)  Please copy/paste and share widely! (Copying and pasting works better than sharing a post like this.)",

Would you please pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act?”  Congress: “No.”  Person: “I had the baby, but I'm out of work. Can I have WIC and food stamps until I get back on my feet?”  Congress: “No.”  Person: “I found a job, but it doesn't offer me insurance. Can I have government guaranteed insurance?”  Congress: “No.”  Person: “My kid got sick and I got fired because I missed time caring for them. Can I get unemployment?”  Congress: “No.”  Person: \"Could you give me health coverage for my sick child?\"  Congress: \"No\"  Person: “I’m having a hard time getting my kid from school consistently. Can we fund after-school programs?”  Congress: “No.”  Person: \"But my child has special need Can you at least give him a special education?\"  Congress: \"No.\"  Person: “I'm prepared to work to support my family. Can you make sure that a full-time job's minimum wage is enough to do that?”  Them: “No. But what's the matter with you and your family, that working two jobs can't lift you out of poverty? And what kind of a parent are you, letting someone else watch your child while you work? If your child doesn't do well in school or gets in trouble, it's entirely your fault. You shouldn't have had a child if you weren't prepared to take care of them.\"  \"But it doesnt matter because you are being deported. You were brought here illegally as a child.  But you can leave your child here!\"  Please copy and share.",
