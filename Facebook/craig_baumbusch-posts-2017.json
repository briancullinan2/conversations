Let's be clear that when  # BLMLA  and  # CENTROCSO  attempt to \"launch\" a campaign that already exists and has had YEARS of hard work put into it, it is attempted erasure of the Black woman's work, as well as the work of the working class and the families who have fought for prosecution from  # DALacey  for YEARS. As  # BLM  cries to the media about the erasure of the Black woman's work, they have undermined this campaign until it was politically expedient to lend their brand to the cal ... l for prosecution. #CENTROCSO claims a higher discipline and theory, yet this practice is the route of opportunism, individualism, and undermines the demand of prosecution by deliberately excluding those who have fought HARD for it to even exist; riding the shoulders of the working class while claiming to represent them. https://www.facebook.com/keyanna.bean/posts/1522679071146543   See More Keyanna Celina https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForCommunityControlOverPolice/photos/a.1520170538241608.1073741828.1484641638461165/1597023153889679/?type=3&theater https://www.facebook.com/CoalitionForCommunityControlOverPolice/photos/a.1537256349866360.1073741830.1484641638461165/1537256876532974/?type=3 https://www.facebook.com/events/332023886974767/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%22106%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22null%22%7D",

        "description": "‎ Bob Vankleeck ‎   to   Craig Baumbusch \"Founded in 2007, the Civilian-Soldier Alliance is an organization of civilians working with veterans and active-duty service-members to build a GI resistance movement towards a just foreign policy. We work with and support service-members and veterans to withdraw military support from the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, supporting resistance within the military that empowers service members to have a voice and develop as leaders organizing for change. To help build this GI-led movement, we work with fellow civilians to build a reliable, committed and experienced support structure for military personnel.  We believe that organizing to withdraw military support from the war can not only win tangible victories, but can also be a transformative process whereby vets and civilians develop the skills and confidence necessary to organize for long-term change.\"  ",

Heist traces the 2008 worldwide economic collapse to the August, 1971 Powell Memo, that called for a money-driven makeover of the U.S. government by big business through corporate control of the media, academia, the pulpit, arts and sciences and destruction of organized labor and consumer protection groups.  Powell Memo is the smoking gun of the class war dividing Americans, today.  Heist: A Who Done It On The Economy? Is the 28-minute documentary the Establishment don’t want you and your friends to see before voting in the upcoming primaries/caucuses!  Please Share, Thank you",

Here are the members to call:  ·         Chairman of the Senate approps committee, Senator Ricardo Lara  (916) 651-4033  The committee consultant: Jolie Onodera Jolie.Onodera@sen.ca.gov   (email is best but you can also call (916) 651-4101)  Vice Chair Senator Patricia Bates   (916) 651-4036  Committee Member Senator Jim Beall  (916) 651-4015  Committee Member Senator JerryCommittee Member Senator Mike McGuire  (916) 651-4002  Committee Member Senator Tony Mendoza (916) 651-4032  Committee Member Senator Jim Nielsen  (916) 651-4004  Please call Chairman Ricardo Lara's office (and other cmte. members if you have time) to let them know you support the bill. And, let us know you made the call!  The bill is not being tagged with a huge cost, approximately $200,000, but we need folks to call the chairman to urge his support of the bill. And. the bill will save $25,000 to $30,000 per homeless person housed.  Calls/emails should be made starting ASAP and ideally should be today (Friday, 5/20).  However the suspense hearing isn’t until 5/27, so early next week should be fine as well.   Please call me if you have any questions at 213-880-3065, or e-mail me at susieanneshannon@gmail.com",

Please take ten minutes really soon to talk to editors in the press and media in general, because most of them have little knowledge of the fatally flawed NY primary, the petition to New York's Attorney General to do it all over, and the probable cause evidence that the purges were orchestrated by Bernie's opponent.  This flow chart by Netra Halperin was presented today to the New York Attorney General in Albany and to the Bernie Sanders Campaign lawyer, Brad Deutsch, in Washington DC, with more meticulously compiled evidence and a timeline, we hope published soon at OpEdNews.  This Probable Cause could become the next scandal in a very long series of scandals for Bernie's opponent as well as the first salvo in a Federal Court hearing to grant a new New York Primary. Please discuss this in brief phone calls asking for further coverage with some of your press friends and other media editors, plus the Bureau Chief of your nearest Associated Press office, even if your primary has already been held. A few of these calls means you have become one of our press liaisons for an honest and clean repeat NY Primary. Thank you!   https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208875786353820&set=gm.622578524560092&type=3&theater  See also my latest article:  \"Those Pledged Super Delegates would run like rats from a sinking ship\" ---NY Primary Redo Could Win it for Bernie   http://www.opednews.com/…/Those-Pledged-Super-Deleg-by-Step…  Please click on this flow chart to enlarge in perfect clear detail:",

        "description": "‎ John Helmeke ‎   to   Craig Baumbusch WHY GEORGE BUSH (U.S. President, twice elected 2000, 2OO4) WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ Against Saddam Hussein and what George Bush Sought to Accomplish in Iraq. .........Two Short [Edited] Quotes from Q&A/ \"BUSH\" (author: Jean Edward Smith) 7/06/2016 (C-SPAN) 00:13:40 JEAN EDWARD: MAYBE BUSH'S WORSE FAULT IS THAT HE IS A BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN WHO BRINGS THAT IDEOLOGY INTO THE PRESIDENCY. HE BELIEVES HE WAS GOD'S AGENT HERE ON EARTH TO FIGHT EVIL. AND MENTIONING GOG AND MAGOG, JUST BEFORE THE IRAQI INVASION, BUSH CALLED PRESIDENT CHIRAC OF FRANCE TO GET THEM TO JOIN THE ATTACK. DURING THE COURSE OF THAT CONVERSATION, HE TOLD THE [FRENCH] PRESIDENT WE WERE FIGHTING GOG AND MAGOG. THEY WERE CREATURES IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. THAT IS THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE FOR MANY EVANGELICALS AND FUNDAMENTALIST CHRISTIANS. AND BUSH GENERALLY BELIEVED THAT. HE GENUINELY BELIEVED THAT HE WAS GOD'SS AGENT HERE ON EARTH TO FIGHT EVIL. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, WHETHER IT IS DOMESTIC EXCESSES OR THE [WAR] AGAINST IRAQ, IF YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE GOD'S AGENT FIGHTING EVIL - ALL HOLDS ARE REMOVED. YOU ARE ON BLANK SLATE AND YOU CAN DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO FIGHT EVIL. I MIGHT SAY THAT THE FRENCH PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND HIS STAFF DID NOT KNOW EITHER. THEY GOT A PROFESSOR IN BASEL [SWITZERLAND] TO [CLUE] THEM IN. CONVINCING THE FRENCH PRESIDENT ALL THE MORE THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THAT. ...................00:10:47 JEAN EDWARD: ...LEAVE WITHIN 90 DAYS. THAT IS WHAT THEY PLANNED FOR. THEY DID NOT PLAN TO OCCUPY IRAQ. GENERAL FRANK'S PLAN ...ON DONALD RUMSFELD'S INSTRUCTIONS: THE MILITARY AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT BELIEVED THEY WERE GOING IN TO REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN, FIND WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION, AND GET OUT VERY QUICKLY. JAY GARNER, THE GENERAL IN CHARGE OF DEALING WITH THE IRAQIS, HAD A COUNCIL, READY TO TAKE CHARGE. AND THEN ON MAY 1 WHEN BUSH SPOKE ON THE FLIGHT DECK OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WITH A BANNER THAT SAID \"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED\" BUSH CHANGED THE GROUND RULES. HE SAID WE WERE GOING TO OCCUPY IRAQ AND SAID WE WERE GOING TO BRING DEMOCRACY TO IRAQ. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING LIBERATORS AND OCCUPIERS IS PROFOUND. LIBERATORS MAKE A COUNTRY FREE. OCCUPIERS IMPOSE THEIR WILL. THE MILITARY HAD NOT PLANNED FOR THAT. THEY HAD PLANNED TO GO IN AND GET OUT.",

DEFEATED NOT BY LOYAL ARMY TROOPS BUT BY HASTILY-ORGANIZED, BADLY-ARMED MILITIAS FORMED BY LEFT-WING POLITICAL PARTIES AND LABOR UNIONS. AND HAVING BEATEN BACK [THE] COUP ATTEMPT, THESE WORKING CLASS MILITIAS FOUND THEMSELVES ESSENTIALLY IN CONTROL OF HUGE SWATHS OF THE COUNTRY. THEY CARRIED OUT A SOCIAL REVOLUTION WITHOUT PARALLEL IN WESTERN EUROPEAN HISTORY. WORKERS TOOK OVER FACTORIES INCLUDING THE FORD AND GENERAL MOTORS PLANTS IN BARCELONA WHICH WERE CONVERTED...  00:29:06 Adam Hochschild: TROLLEY CAR DRIVERS AND RAILWAY WORKER TOOK OVER THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. YOU CAN SEE PICTURES OF LOCOMOTIVES WITH THE, YOU KNOW, INITIALS OF THE ANARCHIST TRADE UNION ON THE SIDE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE. WAITERS TOOK OVER RESTAURANTS. THE RITZ HOTEL IN BARCELONA, THE FANCIEST IN THE [CITY], WAITERS, COOKS AND BUSBOYS TOOK OVER THE DINING ROOM AND CONVERTED IT TO PEOPLE'S CAFETERIA NUMBER ONE FOR THE POOR. [LAUGHTER] MOST OF THESE FOLKS WERE DRIVEN BY THE ANARCHIST TRADITION WHICH WAS SOMETHING VERY STRONG IN SPAIN EVEN AS IT HAD GONE INTO ECLIPSE JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS VIRTUALLY ENTIRELY IGNORED THIS STORY. THEY WERE TOO BUSY COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER COVERING [OTHER STORIES] ESPECIALLY THE SIEGE OF MADRID.",

Share any you find worthwhile.  Once I reached 500, I stopped posting Notes to my profile.  All my writing I now publish on my blog, Armory Of The Revolution. ( https://armoryoftherevolution.wordpress.com/ )  The most kick-ass blog online! Certainly the most radical Animal Rights blog!  Facebook's Notes are difficult to access, they are not searchable, there is no list of articles, no table of contents, not user friendly at all. My blog, however, is state of the art. My articles can be searched, I have tags in each post, it is user friendly, professional, beautifully designed, and best of all cannot be interfered with by Facebook!  I hope you will visit the blog and follow it. Be sure to click Follow on the right sidebar.

        "description": "John Helmeke SUNDAY ELECTIONS IN BERLIN (SEPTEMBER 18, 2016).  The Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), very roughly the equivalent of the Democrats and the Republicans in the United States - though German politics are much farther to the political Left than American politics.  Berlin is thought of as the most tolerant and cosmopolitan city in Germany.  According to zeit.de, of the parties receiving seats in the German capital's own city legislature, the SDP is down -6.7% to 21.6%. The CDU is down to -5.7% to 17.6% between the previous election and this election. The Linke (Left) party is up +3.9 to 15.6% of the vote.  The Grüne (Green) Party is down -2.4% to 15.2% of the vote.  The AfD (Alternative for Germany) party - opposing Germany's open door policy under Chancellor Angela Merkel (the German leader who is a member of the CDU party), under which one million asylum seekers entered Germany last year - is up +14.2, from 0% in the previous election, to 14.2% of the vote.  The Free Democratic Party - which to my understanding of it, complicated in its politics, supports Germany's social welfare state but favors running the economy on the principles of classical liberal (neo-liberal) economic theory of reducing debt and imposing austerity in times of economic recession and depression - is up 4.9% to 6.7% of the vote in this election.",

        "description": "‎ George Douvris IV ‎   to   Craig Baumbusch THE DNC MASQUERADE PARTY IN PHILADELPHIA by GEORGE DOUVRIS  Congratulations to the Hillary Clinton supporters  celebrating her nomination.  If Hillary becomes president you can be well assured that you will have the preferred \"future to believe in\" that you deserve. Through her campaign doners and personal assurances, Monsanto and GMOs  will control our food supply, fossil fuels will make record profits, the TPP will successfully eliminate the middle class, banks will increase their fortunes from credit card debt and college student loans (not to mention foreign debtors like China smiling in collecting their loans and investments), black kids will continue filling the private prison industry from possession of small amounts of pot, police state activities from expanded surveillance and militarized police forces, fraking companies extracting more oil while communities experience earthquakes and drought, pharmaceutical and insurance companies getting even more profits and tax loopholes, most Americans not being able to afford going to the hospital because of no universal health insurance, and of course permanent war that will build up the military industrial complex  from puppet regimes installed to steal other countries oil resources.  As most other political, environmental and cultural activists, I felt that during the late 1960's a growing awareness of social needs was leading our country into a more positive direction. Yet this manifestation of humanism was short lived and deflected as the empire of vested interests struck back. While many of us marched along with Martin Luther King and Bernie Sanders to end wars, racism and oppression, both the Clintons were recruited by the CIA in college and to spy on these same activist groups. Hillary was even fired from the Watergate investigation for \"lying and being unethical\".  Many people turned their back on the global poverty and environmental devastation that has been expanding to horrible proportions Ever since.  Media and political propaganda created an apathetic  society of sheeple willing to go along with the promises of wealth and power in the financial interests of an imperialist empire. False flag operations likewise launched a mindset eager to give up their freedoms because of a relentless fear of \"terrorism\".  We certainly are being terrorized but not by foreign entities but by local conglomerates of power and wealth.   Songwriter Leonard Cohen sings:  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded   Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed   Everybody knows that the war is over   Everybody knows the good guys lost   Everybody knows the fight was fixed   The poor stay poor, the rich get rich   The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor.\"  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. famously said \"no one is free until we are all free.\"  And paraphrasing the words of visionary musician Jimi Hendrix, British statesman William Gladstone and Indian spiritual teacher Sri Chimnoy: \"When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace\".    John Lennon realized that  \"All you need is Love\"  and to \"Give Peace a Chance.\" Jesus Christ would never ask \"who should we drone first\"  and likewise reminds us \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". Bible students take heed of Satan offering Jesus all the military and financial riches of the world but He clearly told the demon to \"get lost\". He also reiterated that it is easier for a blind man to walk through the eye of a needle than someone pursuing riches to enter the kingdom of heaven.\" And when He kicked out the banking cartel from the temple for making money from money lent as in usury\"  the scribes lobbied for his death penalty. Lennon and Christ would both make better Commander in Chiefs than war hawks like Clinton or Trump.  Clinton proudly proclaims that war criminals with blood on their hands Kissinger and Albright have been her role models and mentors as secretary of state.  Similar to a familiar Biblical story, this year's election has brought on its own version of a crucifixion. The mainstream media scribes have lied and distorted Bernie's very rational message of compassion and healing of our broken political system. And just as the Hebrews, people that consider themselves a progressive and socially conscious  society have turned their back on Bernie and in essence asking for the system to crucify him. A statesman of Bernie's quality only comes around once in a lifetime. We must not be led astray and continue  to support him in every way possible.   Bernie Sanders has rekindled the hope that America can once more realign itself to those values of honesty, compassion and justice. The political revolution is not over while awareness is growing that something is terribly wrong as our votes have become a meaningless joke and that democracy has been hijacked and morphed into \"demockery\" instead.  The dirty tricks of the Clinton campaign have been a slap in the face to anyone that has enough attention span to realize what is going on. Every primary this year has seen voter suppression, \"flipped\" voting machines and worse. Like thousands of other Sanders supporters, facebook has locked me out of my account that consisted mostly of Bernie individual and group contacts. Have we really reached the 1984 police state of corporate engineered totalitarianism?   We are being entertained by Clinton who has promised to be generous in adapting many of Bernie's progressive proposals. Having such a long history of lies, who in their right mind would believe her? The idea of voting for her instead of Trump as the \"lesser of two evils\" is likewise a joke. This year's political \"game\" has been staged to maximize not only a grand deception but also to increase television audience  profits from the sensationalism and contrived interest of Trump's candidacy. Like the wrestling shows that he has appeared on, Trump is the bad guy who the audience reacts to by cheering on the hero who in this case is Hillary Clinton. But as the Trumps and Clintons are close friends outside the political ring, the truth is that they are still two faces of the same string pulled by the corporate puppet masters. Both of them represent the same domestic and foreign policies though the media spins a different image. When even  every poll shows that Bernie beats Trump by a wide margin yet Hillary struggles to  keep up, why is there even an issue as to why Bernie Sanders is not going to be the Democratic  nominee. Perhaps he would have had to make more promises to Wall Street as did Hillary with her $350,000 secret speeches to Goldman Sachs private meetings.   So as the Hillary Clinton parade is marching along to fanfare and celebration. Perhaps she can invite her husband Slick Billy to play his saxophone in the same way as Nero played a fiddle while Rome burned. His \"free trade\"  policies  were another blow to the working class of America in the same way that Hillary's work as an attorney for Wall Mart made sure the big ships from China brought in lots of cheap goods yet went back empty with no products from our country to sell there. And as a bonus, wrecking the mom and pops small stores that the Wall Marts  would drive out of business through the cheaper goods made in essentially slave factories.   And curiously, why are the many millions of dollars donated to the Clinton Foundation for the relief of victims in Haiti several years ago still collecting interest and not being distributed.  Don't be blinded by the Clinton's \"Welcome to the Machine\" bandwagon of empty promises which Pink Floyd warmed us about. Wake up out of the matrix of grand deception and not be misled by mainstream media salesmen and sold out pundits. Aristotle clearly called for focus with the axim \"Know Thyself\" and Timothy Leary simply said \"Just say Know.\"    Economist Paul Krugman warns us that America is  on its way to becoming a \"boiled frog\". As he puts it \"I’m referring, of course, to the proverbial frog that, placed in a pot of cold water that is gradually heated, never realizes the danger it’s in and is boiled alive. Real frogs will, in fact, jump out of the pot — but never mind. The hypothetical boiled frog is a useful metaphor for a very real problem: the difficulty of responding to disasters that creep up on you a bit at a time. And creeping disasters are what we mostly face these days.\"  Kenneth Tynan stated in Edinburgh in 1967  \"I attacked those Western playwrights who use their influence and affluence to preach to the world the nihilistic doctrine that life is pointless and irrationally destructive, and that there is nothing we can do about it. Until everyone is  fed, clothed, housed and taught, until human beings have equal leisure to contemplate the overwhelming fact of mortality, we should not (I argued) indulge in the luxury of \"privileged despair.\"  One of the founding fathers of the US government Thomas Jefferson wanted to make sure that people always remembered  \"When the representative body have lost the confidence of their constituents, when they have notoriously made sale of their most valuable rights, when they have assumed to themselves powers which the people never put into their hands, then indeed their continuing in office becomes dangerous to the state, and calls for an exercise of the power of dissolution.\"   Indeed a political revolution is long overdue. The Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia will be the moment of truth and nomination of Bernie Sanders or a continuation of the same political machinery that has brought the world to a gloomy future which we should not believe in.   I doubt if many of the people I quoted in this essay would be marching in the Clinton parade, so you will be in fine company if you aren't either. Let's make sure we help Bernie in every way to be elected president while we still can. It ain't over yet.  FEEL FREE TO SHARE THIS ESSAY",

Bernie Sanders, Keith Ellison, and others addressed the crowd of union organizers and activists. “It is not a radical idea to say that if you work 40 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty!” Sanders thundered. RT’s Anya Parampil spoke with Ellison, who discussed his failed bid to oust Nancy Pelosi in the Congressional leadership, as well as recent smears by wealthy right-wing Democrats accusing him of anti-Semitism.",

Some states are equipped with statutes to do this and some aren't. The lack of coverage by the mainstream press is truly pathetic, given that this poison in routinely added to 15,000 food products and more than 6,000 medications, and very few know that it is metabolized as FORMALDEHYDE!

        "description": "George Douvris IV  shared a  Page  to  Craig Baumbusch 's Timeline. TWO BOOKS BY GEORGE DOUVRIS  CROSSING MORE KARMA ZONES, THE FAMILY ODYSSEY continues where the  journey of my first book ends as together with my wife, three children, and at times 92 year old mother, we move out of the US to seek a new homeland. Eight years of experiences take place in a small Greek village and afterwards our family odyssey takes us through India, Thailand, Bali, Fiji, New Zealand and Australia before landing again in Hawaii.  Lots of adventures and reflections that I'm sure you will enjoy. Also poetry and my political and cultural essays  A few of the reviewers of my new book include STANLEY KRIPPNER,CARL FREEDMAN,ED THIELK,RUSSELL RUDERMAN,LEE UNDERWOOD,CHRIS DYER,PETER TERRY,HARVEY MARTIN JAMES FADIMAN,SCOTT TEITSWORTH AND CHRIS KILHAM   https://www.facebook.com/DouvrisFamily/  For a limited time I am offering a 10% discount on the book and if you wish to purchase both of my books 20% off the total price.   My first book, CROSSING KARMA ZONES, THE JOURNEY BEGINS  are lively tales of growing up in a Greek-American family in the southern part of the US during the 1950's and then coming of age during a backdrop of civil rights unrest in the 60's. I find purpose in anti-Vietnam war activism and then follow the exciting hippie trail to the Woodstock festival and then moving to Haight Ashbury in San Francisco. Through my eclectic integration of humor and reflection through the many exciting passages of my experiences across space and time.   Reviewers included DENNIS MCKENNA,PAUL KRASSNER,PETER TERRY AND ERNEST STEWART   https://www.facebook.com/crossingkarmazones/?fref=ts  If you would like to order any copies directly from me instead of through Amazon, please contact me through any of my facebook profiles or my email  gsrain@yahoo.com. I would be happy to sign the books as well as write a nice personal message on the inside page. The price for the new book  is $24.95 plus postage and the first one $20. I'm sure you will enjoy either or both. And both make fine presents.   Payment can be with a credit card through paypal to my account of gsrain@yahoo.com or with a personal check or money order to my address below. The shipping charges if in the US are $7 for one book or $12 for both. If outside the US, ask me and I can check the price.  Also I would appreciate any shares and likes if you would like to do so  If you prefer to order from Amazon instead, go to their website and write the name of my book and it will appear in both the US and UK sites. Also it is available from both as a Kindle ebook  Thank You  GEORGE DOUVRIS  PO BOX 111  PAHOA, HI  96778",

        "description": "Joshua Gordon  shared a  video  to  Craig Baumbusch 's Timeline. Thank you for liking my previous music video. As an artist I am posting 2 music videos a year to FB to sum up my current reflections.  Share if you want to help me be on Jeff Sessions hit list by next Friday at midnight. I’d really appreciate it ..haha. This composition - Burned to The Ground - is a statement of the mental health history of Pax Americana. We are the inheritors of an empire built on genocide and slavery with the same denial that distance would grant the Nazis and Hirohito Japan if they won WW2.  Another angle of insight on the theme of Greed against Nature in Children of The Third Millennium.    Fanatics, enabled by pious tolerance, have successfully dulled empathy for their victims for all of human history.  Psychology's doctrinal systems - secularized equivalents of religious thought - also impersonalize the soul.  Humans are internally visual first before we think, therefore this composition deliberately uses public domain imagery for archetypal identification with the feelings, thoughts, and attitudes of all who have, and currently, suffer - defiantly, prophetically - from persecution by those who deny Soul. Facing this imagery was heart wrenching, but I think Necessary, to Remember and most importantly Feel, for we ‘successful’ inheritors of the past - like our predecessors - blissfully compartmentalize it.     https://www.facebook.com/withinmillenniums/videos/1911130589130290/ Within Millenniums Ian Gordon https://www.facebook.com/withinmillenniums/videos/1911130589130290/",

Heed Flashes of heart breaking history to Remember - and most importantly Feel - an Expose played in echoing 'hallowed halls' .....against the racist manifest-destiny mindset of Empire.....a sinister evolution of dictatorial regime not exclusive to theists alone.  We live in the Echo-chambers of the inheritors of prosperity built on murder, genocide and slavery with the same denial distance would have granted the Nazis and Hirohito Japan if they won WW2.  Another angle of insight on the theme of Greed against Nature (Climate Change) in music video #1 Children of The Third Millennium.    https://www.facebook.com/withinmillenniums/videos/1911130589130290/  Fanatics, enabled by pious tolerance, have successfully dulled empathy for their victims for all of human history.  Psychology's doctrinal systems - secularized equivalents of religious thought - also impersonalize the soul.  Humans are internally visual first before we think, therefore this composition deliberately uses public domain imagery for archetypal identification with the feelings, thoughts, and attitudes of all who have, and currently, suffer - defiantly, prophetically - from persecution by those who deny Soul. We ‘successful’ inheritors of the past - like our predecessors - are stuck in societies that blissfully rationalize compartmentalization to ‘normalize’ these atrocities.  I’d like to thank my family, friends, and the 1000’s of viewers (half before posting on Facebook) for my Climate Change musical visual statement \"Children of the Third Millennium\" posted below, whose critiques and encouragement moved my heart for this second creation.  I’ve been a Progressive political canvasser since 1981 and belong to a myriad of FB groups worldwide who inspire me to create reflective music videos.

        "description": "‎ Jay Lindberg ‎   to   Craig Baumbusch A RAY OF HOPE Jay Lindberg 5/22/17  The role of Methane in climate science.  Jay, is there any turning back (from the mass extinction event) at this point?  Hi Peggy. The science is very simple. There is over 10 trillion tons of frozen methane (Methane Hydrate) on the planet. Methane hydrate is found on the ocean floors, permafrost, extreme cold regions of Continental shelves. Frozen methane is stable and not a threat to the species.  There is now over 10 billion tons of methane in our atmosphere. The release of methane in the Arctic, permafrost, East Siberian Arctic shelf, Ocean floor, Greenland Tectonic plate, etc. is accelerating and not under our control. Methane is a very powerful greenhouse gas and 100 times more potent than CO2 over a ten year period. The threat of mass extinction is no longer about CO2. CO2 was the trigger. Methane is the bullet. Every one of these regions have many times more methane in frozen form (methane Hydrate) than is needed to trigger a global extinction event. Every one of these regions are at present, unstable and releasing large quantities of methane gas but not enough to kill us, yet.  Turning back- Is there any way we can turn back from our mass extinction event? If there is a way, it would require turning back modern industrial society in a very major way because it is the heat engine that drives the process.  The real question is, can any of us survive (1) the collapse of modern industrial civilization (2) through the mass extermination of species in (3) an environmental collapse and (4) toxic biosphere?  My Answer: We will be burying our children in a very short time because we did not separate rhetoric from reality. We poisoned a beautiful blue planet full of life and triggered a mass extinction event that included all of us.  So what do we do now? I am looking for a mate to love for the rest of our short life. I do not wish to die alone and at this point I need that attachment as a reason to stay in this fight. A cold beer and a front row seat at the mass extinction event is the other option.  So be kind to one another, don't be so damn greedy, protect mother earth, don't accept lies from the government as fact,  challenge corruption, Live your life with courage, challenge and conquer your fears. Do not allow your transgressions to consume your hopes and dreams. We need our boys, to put away our war toys. If we do a lot of things right, we might just live long enough to write a history and build a future we can be proud of. Most of us will not see 2020 if we get this wrong.",

        "description": "‎ Gregory Charles Litzenberg ‎   to   Craig Baumbusch The DSA just voted down a resolution that stated   \"We should recognize that the Democratic Party is not our party, even if we sometimes run or support candidates within it. We have, therefore, no interest in its internal battles, such as the fight between Keith Ellison and Tom Perez. We should refrain from endorsing or supporting Democrats engaged in political struggles within the Democratic Party. Taking part in such internal Democratic Party fights only disorients our members, leading them to believe that the Democratic Party can be a vehicle for the aspirations of working people.  “We believe it is important to emphasize this point because the Democratic Party has historically been the biggest challenge to progressive movements.”  If there was any time to give up on the DSA, now would be it.",
