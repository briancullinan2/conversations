Although I could only catch the tail end of the very last game due to academic committments. I was happy to see we ended on the best note possible with a 20-1 win! Thank you to each and every player who helped us out this season. We may not have ever ran with the same players on a weekly basis, but we can  ... all call ourselved \"Replacements\". Next man steps up and fills their role. Congrats on a fun season you guys and I hope to see you next season!

Thank you all!   See More",

Everyone around me talks as if \"data\" is/are plural, while I can't help but use \"data\" as if it/they were grammatically a singular mass noun (like \"peanut butter\"), thus I don't want to look/sound like an idiot to these people. I try my darnedest to conform, hence cats. I say I'm a data analyst when people ask me what I do, but really I mean I'm a cats analyst.  All that being said, I still refuse to conform to the archaic use of two spaces after a period. The cats show that one space is better than two. Nellie",

So many laughs, so many adventures, so many reunions. But lots of heartbreak, loss, and mourning too.   There were a few big events. But the small and seemingly insignificant moments make the biggest impact. .  To the people who do the best job of caring about me: thank you dearly for making each year worth the time.   I do not own the music.   Song: Back Home  Artist: Andy Grammer Megan Kitson Megan",
