You can say Hohokam and no one thinks you're making it up.     2.You no longer associate rivers or bridges with water.    ...  3.You know that a \"swamp cooler\" is not a happy hour drink.     4.You can contemplate a high temperature of 120 degrees as \"not all that bad, after all it's a dry heat.\"     5.You know that you can make sun tea outside faster than instant tea in your microwave.     6.You have to run your air conditioner in the middle of winter so that you can use your fireplace.     7.The water coming from the \"cold\" tap is hotter than that from the hot\" tap.     8.You can correctly pronounce the following words: \"Saguaro\", \"Tempe\", \"Gila Bend\", \"San Xavier del Bac\", \"Canyon de Chelly\", \"Mogollon Rim\", \"Cholla\", and \"Tlaquepacque\", \"Ajo\".     9.It's noon on a weekday in July, kids are on summer vacation, and not one single person is moving on the streets.     10.Hot air balloons can't fly because the air outside is hotter than the air inside.     11.You buy salsa by the gallon.     12.Your Christmas decorations include a half a yard of sand and 100 paper bags.     13.You think someone driving while wearing oven mitts is clever.     14.Most of the restaurants in your town have the first name \"El\" or \"Los.\"     15.You think six tons of crushed rock makes a beautiful yard.     16.You can say 115 degrees without fainting.     17.Vehicles with open windows have the right-of-way in the summer.     18.People break out coats when the temperature drops below 70.     19.You discover, in July, it only takes two fingers to drive your car.     20.The pool can be warmer than you are.     21.You realize Valley Fever isn't a disco dance.     22.People with black cars or have black upholstery in their car are automatically assumed to be from out-of-state or nuts.     23.You know better than to get into a car/truck with leather seats if you're wearing shorts.    24.Announcements for Fourth of July events always end with \"in case of monsoon...\"     25.You have to explain to out-of-staters why there is no daylight savings time     26.You can say \"haboob\" without giggling.

        "description": "Chris Blackburn I've been lucky enough in my lifetime to attend an OSU vs. Michigan football game, numerous March Madness Games, an NBA final game, a MLB playoff game of my favorite team, and a World Cup soccer match, and yet last night attending the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in Rio was by far my best sporting experience.    I witnessed the definition of courage in Marcia Malsar, one of the torch bearers last night.  Marcia, because of a disease, must use a walking cane to stand and walk.  Last night while carrying the torch, Marcia fell on live TV and in front of thousands at the opening ceremony due to the rain.  Then, as if her legs were that of an ox, and to the roar of the crowd, stood on her own, grabbed the torch, and marched on to the chants of \"Never give up.\"  You need a new  hero in life, look her up.  I witnessed a miracle in front of my own eyes.  Last night's flag bearers were 8 children, all of whom previously could not walk.  However due to special shoes and clothes, were propped by their parents and walked in front of millions to raise the Paralympic flag.  Amazing moment to see and a very emotional moment. Chris Blackburn",
