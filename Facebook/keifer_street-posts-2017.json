Sanders only pays his interns $12 an hour, despite strongly arguing for a $15 minimum wage and heavily criticizing anyone who currently pays less than this.

Everything I learn about this man makes me dislike him more and more.",

He's the sole reason Microsoft never got any real market share in mobile and why they lost the little share they did have. And they probably will never get it back.   He didn't see where the industry moving and he didn't recognize the iPhone as the true threat that it was and by the time he got his head out of his rear, it was too little, too late.  By the time Microsoft got on the train, everyone in the world was already too invested in their own iOS or Android ecosystem of apps and other paid content to switch. Even developers and studios were too invested as they were unwilling spend resources developing for Windows mobile because the # of users was so low - the cost/benefit wasn't there.  If Ballmer had instead invested billions in R&D the same year the iPhone launched, I think the market would be very different today.",

Forgive everyone, even if you can‚Äôt reconcile with them or they are not safe. Sometimes you just have to pass the issue onto a higher court (Jesus).   Holding onto a grudge or holding onto unforgiveness against anyone (even your enemies) does way more damage to you than it does to anyone else. Just let it go. You‚Äôll feel as if a weight has been lifted off of your chest.",
