        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin Someone at work said something insightful the other day that I'd like to share:  Steven Spielberg is the right director/producer for Ready Player One to give it the best chance of mainstream success. For one thing he has a track record of turning obscure source material into blockbuster movies. Secondly, he is the mastermind behind a lot of 80s nostalgia properties (possibly even their media rights owner in certain cases). RPO is as much a celebration of his golden age career as 80s geek fandom in general. Spielberg probably sees things this way and has the best shot of delivering the vision in film.",

The researchers on the project reportedly shut down the A.I. once they realized they could no longer understand its language. One of the reasons that the communication gap is significant is that it could theoretically mean that machines will be able to write their own languages and lock users out of their own systems.\"",

        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin  is at  Park View Historic Hotel . \"A black hole's spin is one key to its power. It's the simple result of conservation of angular momentum: as the width of a rotating object decreases, its spin increases. A big rotating star that suddenly collapses to a small black hole takes this to the extreme; the black hole ends up spinning at humongous [sic] velocities. So fast that the black hole develops TWO surfaces. The inner boundary is the standard event horizon, where any matter or light that crosses can never leave. But there's an outer boundary as well, spherical in shape but somewhat flattened so that it touches the black hole at its poles. Any light or matter entering the region between the two boundaries is whirled around at high speed and, if positioned in just the right way, has a chance to escape. The way out is along magnetic field lines, which direct the matter straight out of the black hole's north and south poles.  By 1969 Roger Penrose fully demonstrated how this special place between a black hole's inner and outer boundaries, which came to be called the ergosphere, can act as an energy amplifier. Penrose showed how any matter and light that enters into this special realm and then escapes actually GAINS energy - a lot of energy - from the black hole's rapid rotation. The loser here is the black hole, whose spin gets reduced a smidgen [sic] in the ergosphere process.\"  - Black Hole by Marcia Bartusiak, 2015.",

Genuinely impressed and thankful that the City managed to revive a vital steam turbine within 24 hrs of damage that powers the pumps in some of the most vulnerable neighborhoods. General Electric contractors came through to the rescue. Also strong call by Governor to call a state of emergency BEFORE a disaster.  Other plans:  1. Repair the other 3 downed turbines ASAP to provide much needed redundancy.  2. A new live website with interactive map showing areas of flooding from 911 call data.

        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin \"The human brain consumes only 20W of power.\"  - Michio Kaku, physicist  \"In the Stone Age, the average human had at their disposal about 4000 calories of energy per day. This included not only food, but also the energy invested in preparing tools, clothing, art, and campfires. Today Americans use on average 228,000 calories of energy per person per day, to feed not only their stomachs but also their cars, computers, refrigerators, and televisions. The average American thus uses 60 times more energy than the average Stone Age hunter-gatherer. Is the average American 60 times happier?\"  - Yuval Harari, historian",

When asked why he issued the pardon, while a catastrophic hurricane was hitting Texas, he said he did it for the ratings! He then went on to make Arpaio out to be somewhat of a hero, not a criminal. Here's a little of what he said:  \"I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they were normally. The hurricane was just starting and I put out that I pardoned, as we call Sheriff Joe. He's done a great job for the people of Arizona. He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona.\"",

Scientists say climate change is at least partly to blame for Hurricane Harvey because the water temp in the Gulf of Mexico is warmer.   From NPR:  \"This year saw high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, where Harvey formed. According to an analysis published in March, the Gulf stayed above 73 degrees Fahrenheit the entire winter. ...  \"At the time Harvey intensified into a Category 4 hurricane, it was over a section of the gulf that was about four degrees above normal, says Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo.  \"The water in the Gulf of Mexico is the heat reservoir to support these hurricanes,\" says Ben Kirtman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami. The warm water and air above the Gulf means there's more energy to drive a storm such as Hurricane Harvey.\"   See More",

Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we've seen, novels we've read, speeches we've heard, and daydreams we've savoured, and out of all that jumble it weaves a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from, and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate, and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that's what the plot requires. We all have our genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy. But in the end, they are all just stories.\"  - \"Homo Deus\" by Yuval Noah Harari",

        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin \"The prediction that in the 21st century humankind is likely to aim for immortality, bliss, and divinity may anger, alienate, or frighten any number of people, so a few clarifications are in order.  Firstly, this is not what most individuals will actually do in the 21st century. It is what humankind as a collective will do. Most people will probably play only a minor role, if any, in these projects. Even if famine, plague, and war become less prevalent, billions of humans in developing countries and seedy neighborhoods will continue to deal with poverty, illness, and violence even as the elites are already reaching for eternal youth and godlike powers. This seems patently unjust. One could argue that as long as there is a single child dying from malnutrition or a single adult killed in drug-lord warfare, humankind should focus all its efforts on combating these woes. Only once the last sword is beaten into a ploughshare should we turn our minds to the next big thing. But history doesn't work like that. Those living in palaces have always had different agendas to those living in shacks, and that is unlikely to change in the 21st century.\"  - Yuval Noah Harari, \"Homo Deus: A Brief History Of Tomorrow,\" 2017.",

        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin \"In the spring of 1940, when the Nazis overran France from the north, much of its Jewish population tried to escape the country towards the south. In order to cross the border, they needed visas to Spain and Portugal, and together with a flood of other refugees, tens of thousands of Jews besieged the Portuguese consulate in Bordeaux in a desperate attempt to get that life-saving piece of paper. The Portuguese government forbade its consuls in France to issue visas without prior approval from the Foreign Ministry, but the consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, decided to disregard the order, throwing to the wind a 30 year diplomatic career. As Nazi tanks were closing in on Bordeaux, Sousa Mendes and his team worked around the clock for 10 days and nights, barely stopping to sleep, just issuing visas and stamping pieces of paper. Sousa Mendes issued thousands of visas before collapsing from exhaustion.  The Portuguese government - which had little desire to accept any of these refugees - sent agents to escort the disobedient consul back home, and fired him from the foreign office. Yet officials who cared little for the plight of human beings nevertheless had a deep reverence for documents, and the visas Sousa Mendes issued against orders were respected by French, Spanish, and Portuguese bureaucrats alike, spiriting up to 30,000 people out of the Nazi death trap. Sousa Mendes, armed with little more than a rubber stamp, was responsible for the largest rescue operation by a single individual during the Holocaust.\"  - Yuval Noah Harari, \"Homo Deus,\" 2017.",

But such professions will probably require much more creativity and flexibility than current run-of-the-mill jobs, and it is unclear whether 40-year-old cashiers or insurance agents will be able to reinvent themselves as virtual world designers. Try to imagine a virtual world created by an insurance agent! And even if they do so, the pace of progress is such that within another decade they might have to reinvent themselves yet again. After all, algorithms might well outperform humans in designing virtual worlds too.  Since we do not know how the job market would look in 2030 or 2040, already today we have no idea what to teach our kids. Most of what they currently learn in school will probably be irrelevant by the time they are forty. Traditionally life has been divided into two main parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working. Very soon this traditional model will become utterly obsolete, and the only way for humans to stay in the game will be to keep learning throughout their lives, and to reinvent themselves repeatedly. Many if not most humans may be unable to do so.\"  - Yuval Noah Harari, \"Homo Deus: A Brief History Of Tomorrow,\" 2017.",

        "description": "Vladimir Zuzukin \"The Carnot cycle is a theoretical cycle proposed by French military engineer Sadi Carnot in his 1824 monograph 'Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire,' subsequently adapted and expanded by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin. It provides an upper limit on the efficiency that any engine can achieve in the conversion of heat into useful work. It is not an actual thermodynamic cycle but is a theoretical construct.  Every single thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. When a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state, a thermodynamic cycle is said to have occurred. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine. A system undergoing a Carnot cycle is called a Carnot heat engine, although such a \"perfect\" engine is only a theoretical construct and cannot be built in practice.\" [excerpted from Wikipedia]  - Zen & The Art of Bicycle Maintenance, 2017.",
