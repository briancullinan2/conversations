Let me know if someone has a bed for me.  ‚ù§Ô∏è    Can‚Äôt wait to veg the fuck out during thanksgiving break and cuddle with my dogs for hours. Kiss their foreheads and pet their warm bellies.

They were cynical of power. They were where the art came from.  Now I can count on one hand the true comedians who use their gift to punch up to real power while late night megastars like Bill Maher rake in millions of dollars advancing blatant war psyops. Eminem raps about how much he loves the US military, how great Obama and John McCain are, and how badly Trump ‚Äútormented‚Äù and ‚Äúslandered‚Äù Hillary Clinton during the election. And just today Jim Carrey ‚Äî comedian, actor, painter and aspiring Buddha ‚Äî has shared a painting of the president kissing Vladimir Putin‚Äôs butt cheeks, with the caption ‚ÄúThey bailed him out, set him up and made him their stooge. With Trump in the WH, Putin may win the 3rd World War without firing a shot.  # PuckerUpPOTUS ‚Äù.  The spark has gone out from the eyes of the starry-eyed artists. The sincere impulse to apprehend the soul of the universe which drove them to create beauty has been snuffed out and replaced with stock portfolios and vapid award ceremonies. In the places where we used to look for truth and light we now find a bunch of stuffy millionaires cheerleading for the CIA and the new cold war. They are McCarthyists and conformists. They are amazingly uncool.\"   # McResistance",

I started receiving close to 200 friend requests a day for weeks after that. The only reason many of you know me is because of that decision to get in touch with people who are more involved than me and taking that inspiration and turning it into action.   I think it was  Eden McFadden ,  Jessica Salans ,  Jeremy White  and a few other people.  ‚ù§Ô∏è  They were sort of celebrities for me back then.

One was planned by a group of Hillary supporters (several of the organizers have Rodham as their middle name on Facebook) They refused to work with us, and even tried to disrupt our event by sending their volunteers into our crowd and trying to disperse it with a megaphone, telling people we didn't have a permit, and \"tattling\" to the cops about our presence at a 1st Amendment event.   We ended up joining with their march because an alarming number of attendees were coming to us and saying that the other group was being divisive and they just wanted to be in solidarity for the survivors. We marched our crowd, which was at least four times the size of theirs, down to their march kick off point. At the end of their march they held a press conference, at which only white women spoke on the microphone.   We offered for them to have Tarana Burke speak, the black woman who bravely founded the  # MeToo  movement 10 years ago. They declined. THEY DECLINED. The next time you hear some establishment type ranting about how progressives are racists and misogynists, keep this in mind. Their event and the way they handled themselves was the epitome of white feminism and establishment fuckery, to the detriment of actual healing and growth.  I'm proud to announce that the  # MeTooMarch  created a space that was wholly inclusive of all survivors of sexual assault and abuse. We had representation from the trans community, workplace harassment, child molestation, missing and murdered indigenous women, sexual assault in prisons, male survivors and national leaders of the fight against rape culture.   # PuttingBeckysOnBlast   # aTaleOfTwoMarches ‚Äù Silvia Merlos 07:08 391,883 Views The Young Turks  was live. Follow See First Following  ¬∑  November 9 at 5:20pm  ¬∑  Hillary Clinton said something that caused me to check myself. I think all progressives should seriously consider it. ‚Äî  Shaun King Shana East",

        "description": "Tania Singh PRELIMINARY TARGET SENATORS FOR THE REPUBLICAN TAX BILL:  John McCain (Arizona) - (202) 224-2235  Susan Collins (Maine) - (202) 224-2523  Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) - (202) 224-6665  Bob Corker (Tennessee) - (202) 224-3344  Jeff Flake (Arizona) - (202) 224-4521  Ron Johnson (Wisconsin) - (202) 224-5323  These are the Senators most likely to defect from GOP ranks. Of the six, Ron Johnson is the only confirmed \"no.\"  I will update you all as more Senators announce their intentions. Let's get to work, they want this to pass by the end of the year, so our time is very limited!  If you know anyone in these states, PLEASE make sure they see this and make the calls, their voices are by far the most important here.",

It's a primal trap your brain uses to assess levels of threat when faced with potentially life threatening situations. And partisan hacks use it against you all the time.  Notice how when someone is murdered it is entirely inappropriate by everyone's standards to say, \"Yes, it's awful what happened, but Hitler murdered 12 million people.\"  See how that's not useful, even if it's true?  Trying to diminish acts of violence and aggression by ranking them against each other accomplishes the following:  1. It sets a precedent for anyone contemplating abuse to keep their vile behavior just on the right side of outright condemnation.  2. It causes pain, embarrassment, and despair for the victim who already had to overcome a lot of self-doubt to come forward.  3. It sends a message to other victims that their stories won't be taken seriously unless it measures up to the greater of two assaults.  Resist the urge to minimize. Resist the urge to compare. It's not necessary, and is in fact hurting everyone.\"-  Lily Starling",
