I've received several messages from people today claiming I sent a message to that with a link to a sight with a virus. I have no idea what link this is, or indeed what message was sent as I can honestly say I didn't send a message. \n\nWhat I am aware of this afternoon is that when I tried to log in I was unable to as my password would not be accepted and I have had to reset them. I'm not clever when it comes to computers, but I can only guess my account was hacked and this message/link/virus ... whatever it was was sent by the hacker. I really can't apologise enough to everyone if its caused problems on their computers, but I will state that if you recieve a message from me I never add links .... because I don't know how to.\n\nsorry again.\nTracy\n\n"
