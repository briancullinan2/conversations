Also reflected in the term \"Tory Anarchist\" is the idea that a sign of intelligence is being able to believe in two contradicting principles at the same time.   Children have great difficulty living with contradiction and ambiguity.  They are always demanding that everything be one way or the other.  This is exactly why the left is essentially childish.  They don't understand that there are contradictions in life for good reasons.  And the sign of maturity is being able to live with ambiguity.  Ambiguity is the state of nature.  God, or if you prefer, nature, creates predators and prey, lone wolves and herds of buffalo.   They all have their place in the world, and if one or other of them were to disappear,   nature would be out of balance and we all Life would suffer.",

We both knew going in that we are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, and that was the point.  Part of what I wrote to him was this:  \"It may tell you something about my sensibilities, I hope, that I listen weekly to the podcast of Robert Scheer, SCHEER INTELLIGENCE.   \"Although he and I are on opposite poles politically, I respect both his career and his intelligence and strength of convictions.  \"I also don't disagree with him 180° that often.   \"Sometimes, the real disagreement between people who are seemingly on opposite sides,   \"is not so much what the problem is, as what the solution is.\"",

Ink on papyrus or paper has proven to last for thousands of years in reasonably dry conditions.   Unless there is a contiguous technology civilization that goes forward unbroken from our time,  Everything stored digitally today whether on hard drives or tape or floppy disks or silicon chips,  Will soon disappear and be lost.

        "description": "Robert Chandler Nikki Moonitz  asked a question about the relationship of slavery versus other issues in the Civil War.  Nikki, Your question underlines certain factors about who really controls the country that are at the heart of our present conflict today.  States rights and slavery were intertwined. But So had been other issues including tariffs-all of which had risen to crisis levels in the 1820s and 1830s  It all came to a head under Andrew Jackson, a Southerner from Tennessee and a slave owner himself,    when South Carolina was threatening secession over the issues of nullification and tariffs.  Jackson, who had been old enough to fight in the revolutionary war was an ardent Unionist.  By the time of the Civil War 30 years later,   almost no one was still alive who had lived through the revolution so union fervor was not as powerful in the south,   and abuses from the north of 60 years made secession a more thinkable choice at least emotionally to many Southerners.  Eventually, Jackson stared down the secessionists and outmaneuvered them.   But Civil War War came perilously close to happening in 1833.    And slavery was not the issue at that time.   Slavery was much more in the fore in 1860 when Lincoln was elected.  Slavery was not in danger of being abolished at that time   but it's expansion was being restricted so it couldn't go into the western territories and free states.  So, yes slavery was an issue and the most prominent one.  But so was state sovereignty and the relationship between the states and the central government.  The Southern states had felt for decades that their liberty was being more more constricted, and that they were in danger of being permanently dominated by the industrial urban / financially dominant north.  A fear that came true and from which the South has only somewhat escaped in the last couple of decades.  All the states between New York and California suffer from the dominance of media power which is located in New York and Los Angeles.  This is no small thing, and it is much of the reason we feel like we are on the brink of another kind of Civil War right now.",

And in terms of numbers of people worldwide killed by Communism, Fascism is in the second ranks.   Of course the difference between 80 or 100 million versus 300 or a half a billion human beings,  is not a meaningful calculus.   Fascists and Communists are horrors beyond all comprehension.  Yet somehow we consider Nazis worse than Commies. Why choose?  People also continually forget that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were allies until the middle of 1941.  They both invaded Poland at the same time from opposite directions and divided it up between them.  When Hitler invaded Russia, it was a shock that caught Stalin totally offguard leaving him paralyzed with fear for six weeks, never leaving his bed.",

        "description": "Robert Chandler Brian St Cyr  Brian, do you think today is for fucking forever?  Do you realize how profoundly the world has changed in just 220 or so years since the invention of the steam engine?  Do you realize how incredibly the world has  changed since 1900 and the advent of internal combustion engines, the airplane, electricity, radio, and all the rest?  Do you realize how much the world has changed in 35 years since personal computers became widespread?  The world changes, civilizations disappear, knowledge and technologies are gained, but also lost.  How many people do you think have a floppy disc drive that they used to use every day in the 1980s?  I have Microsoft WORD files from the early 90s that are unreadable now. Current versions of EORD can't open them.   I know and understand technology far more deeply than you because I've been writing about it - selling it, promoting it, popularizing it -  on behalf of clients like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, National Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices, and many more since before you were born.  You get so mesmerized by one fact, that you can't see the wider world of fact.   Your ignorance of history and understanding of human kind make you blind.",

        "description": "Robert Chandler Lane Campbell  \"Crippling student loan debt\" was created by the Democrats,  Who made it easy to get a student loan   but, put no ceiling what was reasonable to borrow for tuition.  Consequently, colleges and universities knowing that the students could borrow almost anything for education,  They jacked up their tuition rates far far beyond what inflation was.  That's why tuition today is 20 or 30 times what it  was in the 1960s   when we haven't had that kind of inflation even in our worst decades.   It is a greedy academic system that has victimized students. Robert Chandler",

Are you going to the Crissy Field counter-demonstration against Say Your Prayers or whatever that nut group is called? Or are you choosing to give it a wide berth and marching instead from Harvey Milk Plaza to Civic Center to celebrate America's rainbow diversity? I'm still mulling over my plan of action. But whatever you do, brothers and sisters, keep it peaceful! David Talbot David",

Also, the population is largely self Reliant.   Not helpless sitting there while the water rises above their heads  I'll bet neither Mares nor Governor is in Texas will sit there leaving buses to be covered with water rather than taking them to higher ground for vacuolation work. That's what happened in New Orleans  I'm sure they have capable rescue teams right there on the scene in places like Houston and San Antonio and can fly in from Dallas or Ft Worth etc.   Meanwell, push his Chief of Staff is a very capable three or four star Marine Corps general.  I'm sure he's also going to make sure nothing gets out of hand",
