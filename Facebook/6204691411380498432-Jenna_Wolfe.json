I'm reaching out today about an open Solutions Architect role with my client in Baltimore, MD. \n\nGiven your lengthy list of preferred locations, I figured it wouldn't hurt to just check in and see if you may be open to the East Coast. \n\nThis would be a 12-24 month contract with Exelon. If you have any interest or know of someone else who may be interested, please let me know the best email to send the full job description. \n\nThank you,\nJenna\n\nJenna Wolfe\njenna@ntechsol.com\n",
