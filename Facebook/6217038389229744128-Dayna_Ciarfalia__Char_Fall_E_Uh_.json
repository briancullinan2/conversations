My perm team works quite a bit with Java roles, but on the contract/C2H side I see more .NET stuff.\n\nI enjoy the bleeding edge JS technology stuff -- Angular, React, Redux - functional programming, etc. Now THAT stuff is fun!\n"

It's only been a few months, but hopefully things are going well!\n\nAlso, since you were in the education space for a time, I wanted to see if you may happen to know any software developers/engineers who may be open to a new perm gig in the Chandler area? I have a large-ish Ed-Tech client who's looking for guys and gals whom are passionate about education to join one of their 7 dev teams. (primarily .NET but they have several teams using Python, opensource tech, etc). \n\nOh, and they're able to pay super well so that's always a positive as well!\n\nHave a great evening!\nDayna\n"
