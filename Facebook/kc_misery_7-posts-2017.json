Apparently, it's okay for them to send death threats, but it's \"insensitive\" to respond by telling them that their religion is bastardized Judaism.    I'm truly humbled and I've learned a very valuable lesson.  I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to the thin-skinned, camel piss drinking, child molester idolizing asshole who can't deal with reality.  I'm sorry.  I'll try to sugar-coat it next time. Aisha",

Sort of.   I want a garden so I can feed my neighbors and homeless people that surround me every day.   I want to encourage people, birds, bees and butterflies to just keep living.  I'm broke as shit, but I have a ton of land to grow food.   I need help with fundraising and organizing a garden.  The only real experience I have is growing tomatoes and freaking houseplants.   I have a few grow lights.   I have time and the will to listen.   Someone please help me. Earl Aisha Aisha Miles Aisha Miles",
