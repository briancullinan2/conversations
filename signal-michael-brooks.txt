No, they do some bullshit session generation.
Jan 2 11:07pm
Oh strange, well sessions are blocked right. You'd have to use an amp-iframe until they allow amp-js
Jan 2 11:07pm
Amp-js is coming soon
Jan 2 11:07pm
Ohhhh that could work.
Jan 2 11:08pm
You can <A> to a loading page that bounces the.
Jan 2 11:08pm
Maybe that's why they don't want to, Js and iframe already work.
Jan 2 11:08pm
You  can redirect to a page that loads .js
Jan 2 11:08pm
Yeah
Jan 2 11:08pm
Yeah, ugly but the iframe should work.
Jan 2 11:08pm
There are tools to avoid it.  Iframe is slow, a redirect is much faster
Jan 2 11:08pm
Hmmm
Jan 2 11:09pm
Adding an iframe will slow down your page noticeabley
Jan 2 11:09pm
I'll take a look at this tomorrow. Thank you. I owe you one.
Jan 2 11:09pm
Redir to the page that makes the session id and then redirect to the checkout
Jan 2 11:09pm
Np, good luck man!
Jan 2 11:09pm
I want to see you do we
Jan 2 11:09pm
Well
Jan 2 11:10pm
You too.
Jan 2 11:10pm
Ads, we both need ads.

G2g to sleep. Yes, I just don't want to create expectations. Read the mrmustache I sent you earlier. By doing everything yourself and pacing your work in free time you create a vortex on only doing meaningful things that you can accomplish. Something like that.
Jan 2 11:11pm
Will do, gnight
Jan 2 11:12pm
By forcing yourself to proceed only as your own free time permits, you are producing a powerful vortex of joyful self discipline and wealth. Your spending is limited. Your costs for each project are drastically reduced. And your time-management skills are constantly honed, as you learn not to waste time on things like TV and websurfing

I want to replace my needs for stacks and Dev tools, run my own GitHub, my own syntax highlighter, my own notebook parser and runner, if I maintain my notebook I can build more and more advanced stuff with less code. I only want to deal with code that is open source and will work many years from now. Even if that means booting up an old PC to run it, at least it still exists and runs.
Jan 2 11:18pm
Yeah, that is a lot of work.  I like having a tool box that allows me to fill an immediate need.  When a new tool becomes available i use it.
Jan 2 11:19pm
I use Django so I can move.to a y cloud, and I'm not stuck like snapchat
Jan 2 11:20pm
Django could run in 100 years from now on a VM

It should be too hard to replicate the osx, iOS UI with bezel.
Nov 20, 2019 4:31pm
All built on Gnome Shell to make a carbon-like window manager
Nov 20, 2019 4:31pm
They did it in html, it runs fucking chromuim as the WM
Nov 20, 2019 4:32pm
But it looks and feels like osx
Nov 20, 2019 4:32pm
Oh cool, I see their dock
Nov 20, 2019 4:32pm
Even down to the keyboard commands
Nov 20, 2019 4:32pm
There are skins for it, and I can't even tell the difference
Nov 20, 2019 4:32pm
Read about fucking Gnome Shell
Nov 20, 2019 4:33pm
Beautiful, I always liked gnome over kde
Nov 20, 2019 4:34pm
There is also the new Snapcraft.io crosa-distro package system that has a lot of commerical interest
Nov 20, 2019 4:35pm
It could be the first open app store for all platforms
Nov 20, 2019 4:35pm
That is what they are trying to do anyway
Nov 20, 2019 4:35pm
Snaocraft.io on elemebtryos (which is Ubuntu + gnome shell)
Nov 20, 2019 4:36pm
Oh cool
Nov 20, 2019 4:36pm
I think with these new techs it is the perfect time to go back to Linux
Nov 20, 2019 4:36pm
JavaScript is over powered
Nov 20, 2019 4:36pm
And fucking chromuim is in everything now
Nov 20, 2019 4:36pm
I know! That's is why I want to start porting Nodejs libraries to other languages automatically
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
I'm looking into make my game container to work with sbapcraft
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
I think u can do it, but it low priority right now
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
I can*
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
How amazing if we prove not only are all frameworks the same because eventually it has to run electrons, but also, all languages are actually the same
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
Probably u too :)
Nov 20, 2019 4:37pm
Yeah, I mean if you need a language to do visual stuff, why not use html JavaScript
Nov 20, 2019 4:38pm
I also want Scipy in Nodejs
