./conversations/linkedin-Michael Leventhal.json:        "summary": "    Currently based in Bamako, Mali, I am an ex-Silicon Valley Techie growing a start-up NGO bringing practical education in STEM, entrepreneurial and innovation skills, programming and robotics to West Africa. In addition to tech-world proficiencies in engineering, marketing, business development and start-ups, my experience now includes executive management, international development, government relations, and education.My tech profile consists of entrepreneurial technical product management combined with high-leverage marketing strategy and engineering collaboration. Passion for launching new enterprises and new technologies, producing do-whatever-it-takes creative and successful solutions, often under challenging business conditions. Running an NGO in Mali, West Africa, makes great use of my experience in operating under challenging business conditions.In my last decade in Silicon Valley I specialized in hardware accelerators and massively parallel compute architectures and related software ecosystems. At Xilinx I led the effort to enable and promote the wide-scale utilization of FPGAs in hyperscale data centers as computing devices replacing CPUs and GPUs, especially in areas such as machine learning. Prior to that, for Micron, I led GTM as well as some R&D activities for the Automata Processor, focusing on HPC, bioinformatics and graph processing applications. Before Micron I was responsible for product management at LSI and Tarari (acquired by LSI) for FPGA and ASIC-based accelerators for networking, security, and data processing and related software stacks.Prior to moving into parallel compute architectures I was an internet entrepreneur, participating in the creation of XML and many of the core technologies around it, running my own company and partnering with several other start-ups in the U.S. and Europe.I‚Äôm a seasoned communicator, author of many blogs and technical papers, and a book, and am a  frequent speaker at conferences.\n  \n  \n",

./conversations/JessieMartin-.json:            "message": "\nRight. And if you're already friends or whatever, then that's different, but if it's like \"Oh hey, you're an email address that I have. How are you? Yeah, don't care. Gimme money\" then that sucks.\nBut I'm not accusing you of that.\n"
./conversations/JessieMartin-.json:            "message": "\nI'm not accusing you of being manipulative. I'm sorry that it came across that way -- I didn't mean it that way. \n\nWhen I say skeptical I refer mostly to some of your beliefs that I don't hold. But, I mean, I'm skeptical of lots of things. If I were only friends with people who believed everything I believe, the world be a much less interesting place.\n\nAs for the other stuff, well, we did hurt you. So I can hardly blame Iga for feeling that way. We absolutely did. Of course we didn't mean to, but that doesn't really make it much better; intentions only go so far.\n\nThe disrespect thing... well, she hit on Mike much harder once it was clear he was my boyfriend. So frankly, the feeling is mutual. But that was what, 6 years ago? Whatever annoyance I had has long expired, you know? It barely mattered at the time, because her disrespect in no way harmed/harms me, and it certainly doesn't matter now. \n\nI guess I would hope the same applies the other direction.\n"

My step dad beat me up as a child.  Iga doesn't trust my ex to talk to me (<- but she is close).  David Smith ignored me.  I had 3 screener interviews today.  Nothing fucking matters to me anymore.  And that's why I can finally believe when everyone says I will be successful because I'm Brilliant!  Completely broke, going to a stupid Dave Ramsey meeting.  That is the key!

Dave especially tends to aggressively make sure everyone who wants a drink has one at all times. I didn't even know she brought alcohol, and it's not like anyone would have been put out if she'd taken the rest with her, but if that's seriously a sticking point, I'd be glad to send her a bottle of equal dollar value. Perhaps that would be contributing to her well being.\n\n\nOn to you and me. This is way more drama than I am prepared for, desire, or am willing to deal with. I would like a friendship, and I would like to not be unnecessarily cruel in the face of what is obviously a very hard time for you, but this is grossly inappropriate. Whatever mental break you're having right now, you need to get help.\n\nI don't think I can ‚Äúwrite something trustworthy‚Äù to Iga. Even if I did, I doubt she would trust it, and she shouldn't. Not because she has anything to fear from me; whatever feelings we shared in the past are gone. You are the problem here. \n\nLord knows Iga's given me no reason to like her, but I can't even imagine how it would feel to have someone I love talk to other people in this way and not even tell me about it for a long time. You have chosen this woman to be your life partner and best friend. You need to treat her like your life partner and best friend.\n\nAnd on some level, I think she probably knows all this, too, but it's easier to blame me than to face this. I can't even fault her for that. But there is something seriously wrong between you two, and you need to face it instead of dragging me into it.\n\n"

Each of us has a sophisticated system that throws away most of our experiences, keeps only a few choice samples, mixes them up with bits from movies we've seen, novels we've read, speeches we've heard, and daydreams we've savoured, and out of all that jumble it weaves a seemingly coherent story about who I am, where I came from, and where I am going. This story tells me what to love, whom to hate, and what to do with myself. This story may even cause me to sacrifice my life, if that's what the plot requires. We all have our genre. Some people live a tragedy, others inhabit a never-ending religious drama, some approach life as if it were an action film, and not a few act as if in a comedy.

Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a court order requiring him to stop racially profiling Latinos during traffic stops and detentions. He had faced up to six years in prison.   Arpaio's aggressive tactics became the model for anti-immigrant demagogues, including Trump. In fact, Arpaio was one of Trump's earliest supporters, endorsing him for president early in the camp ... aign.

That is the surest sign that the people have lost their power.  You need a specific person to be in a specific chair or else all is lost? No. All is lost when we believe that the State can solve problems and has some wealth of its own with which to do so. Government has no money of its own, no power of its own. Yet I see people on both sides of the aisle begging for serfdom: \"Please take my money and spend it for me. And please force others to do likewise. Moreover force others to behave as pleases me. Only you can do this, Great State.\"  Every era has its false idols. Ours generation's false idol is the State. As people awoke from the prejudice and superstition of the middle ages, so we will awaken to our own power. You want control over your own life? Take it. Whatever we ask the government to do for us is power that we lose, and rarely ever get back.  If you really believe in socialized medicine, free education, or any other entitlement, would you support these causes with your own earnings if suddenly given a ~33% raise (a full refund of all income tax and social security)? Think deeply on this. If we really believe in these causes, shouldn't we all just keep our money and fund accordingly? But it's become so deceptively easy to spend other people's money, to raise debt against money we haven't even earned yet, and to force others to give up their earnings under the threat of imprisonment.  It's a deep mess. Time to take the power back. Aneesh Mark Vitrone",
./conversations/aneesh_karve-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Wild Feminine The blessing of Trump, if there can be one, is that he is shining the brightest light on the toxic effects of patriarchal (rather than matriarchal) patterns: dominance, disrespect, abuse, taking of power, power over, threats, denigration of the feminine and the female body, insecurity cloaked in ultimate authority (otherwise known as authoritarianism), and actions based in fear and hate rather than love. As a healer working closely to restore the feminine in the heart of women‚Äôs bodies for the past 20 years, I know this energy well. Every woman does too in her core because this toxic patriarchal essence has taken something, and often many things, from us collectively and personally. But know this: I have also seen time again that the feminine can not be destroyed. As the giver of life, the holder of life, the essence of life‚Äì‚Äìthe feminine always rises and becomes stronger. This is what we are seeing now, the clarification and cleansing process involved in this rise of the feminine. Thanks to Hilary running for President as the first women, and Trump embodying the worst of the broken masculine, it can no longer be hidden or denied how toxic the old patriarchal patterns are. Mostly, they exist subtly in layers beneath our structures, beliefs, and actions. But with this election, whether subtle or profound we all must see the hidden layers and bring them to light for healing. Take heart that this is part of the clearing and the feminine is returning. We must feel the pain to heal the pain, and so here we are in the midst of our collective witnessing‚Äì‚Äìand healing.  # imwithher Bridget Regan Kristi Norman Kristina Marie Andrea Grace Antonia Louise Baur Andrea Drea Helgager Rachael Henley",

I get why some people are posting post-election hate crimes: to draw attention to ugly behavior so that we can stop it. Not only are some of these hate crimes fabricated [1] but they spread fear and anger--and they make a small minority of ignorant people look a lot more important than they are. So it's about balancing positive observations with negative ones. Our minds, and the media, have an \"episodic bias\" that loves to dote on train wrecks.

In an extensive interview broadcast on CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" Trump said that such behavior represented only \"a very small amount\" of his support but that any was unacceptable.  \"Don't do it,\" the president-elect said. \"That's terrible, because I'm going to bring this country together.\"  To reinforce the point, Trump looked directly at the camera and demanded: \"Stop it.\"  For Americans who have loudly expressed fear about his impending presidency, Trump was reassuring, saying: \"I would tell them, 'Don't be afraid, absolutely. ... Don't be afraid. We are going to bring our country back.

./conversations/aneesh_karve-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Aneesh Karve Stay with me, friends. I believe in an America that works for people of every race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation. I did not vote for Donald Trump and I did not vote for Hillary Clinton. You're safe with me. Now let's go after some things that are not working in our political discourse.  The media are taking the world for a ride with race-baiting and gender-baiting. They will shamelessly attribute every discriminatory thing that happens for the next four years to Trump. Because it riles their viewership and nets them traffic.  Ignorance existed before Trump and will exist after. We are much better off with discrimination out in the open, because we can combat it in the open. Trump doesn't make people prejudiced. They did that to themselves. Trump's unfiltered style does encourage people to say things that they were once too shy to admit--and that is the only way we'll know who needs help. Welcome to the First Amendment. We're going to hear some extraordinarily hateful things in the coming months. Just remember, \"sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"  It is incumbent upon the President to denounce discrimination and create an America that works for human beings of every religion, gender, race, etc. And I find Trump's comments on women repulsive. He would be wise to message unity in the coming months.  That said, there are a few subtleties and logical fallacies that keep tripping people up in the newly ignited discussion on equality:  1) Guilt by association (and affirming the consequent) - \"This guy is a Trump supporter. This guy is a racist. Trump is a racist.\"  2) Imputation - \"Ten racist things happened after Trump was elected. Trump caused ten racist things.\"  3) Confirmation bias - \"These 'Trump supporters' did horrible things. But I'll conveniently ignore the numerous instances of Trump supporters being beaten, harassed, and threatened for their political preference.\"  4) Clinton's murderous foreign policy in the Middle East - If ever there was an evil act of discrimination, it is represented by Clinton's foreign policy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria. It remains impossible for her to claim any moral high ground in human rights. Unless you believe that Americans are the only humans. So Clinton supporters can promptly jump off of their moral high horse. I will add that her campaign took millions in donations from countries with atrocious human rights records, especially in their treatment of women.  5) Islam - There is a very nuanced discussion to be had here. And most people will be triggered before the discussion even starts. The fact is that some factions of Islam and some countries in the Middle East support policies that are contrary to America's ideals of equality. In support of women's rights, gay rights, and a civil justice system, it is constructive and truthful to attack the ideals of \"radical Islam.\" This does not mean abridging freedom of religion. It does mean that calling out hateful ideologies, without being shouted down by \"Islamophobia\", is something we should expect to hear and have the courage to do.  6) Immigration - Opposing illegal immigration is not the same as being anti-immigrant. I am the son of immigrants to this country. I support the rule of law and I support immigration, legal immigration. Nothing is more important to order than the rule of law, and nothing is more important to the rule of law than consistency. It is a threat to the rule of law to \"be nice\" to some people just because we feel like it. If anyone doubts this, try \"just showing up\" in Canada and see what happens.  7) Race and the election - if you really want to be open-minded, listen to the Black, Muslim, and Female Trump supporters (like this  https://twitter.com/StacyOnTheRig‚Ä¶/status/796364933344743425 ). They have excellent and rational points. But the Left repeatedly shamed such viewpoints into silence. To the best of my knowledge, Trump gained in his Black and Latino share of the vote over Mitt Romney. Moreover, the same people who elected Barack Obama simply didn't show up to vote for Clinton. So every time that someone says \"racism elected Trump\" it not only ignores the facts, but shames everyone that voted for him into silence.

./conversations/zaju_fe-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Andy Crites By Frankie Hughes  THE MYSTERY AND REVELATION OF THE FALSE christ AS PROPHESIED IN REVELATION 13:11-18.  The end times book of Revelation foretells of 2 beasts that shall appear in the form of men upon the earth prior to the second coming of Christ. The first beast is Satan the Devil himself come in the flesh to set up his end times New World Order kingdom on earth as prophesied and he shall also seek to destroy biblical Christianity; Revelation 13:1-10 -- Daniel 7:23.  I have sadly witnessed some people claim that these two beasts are not men but are empires or religious orders or monetary systems; but the wordage contained in the scriptures CLEARLY defines and prophesies them BOTH as MEN and that EXACTLY the form in which they shall appear; please do NOT let anyone deceive you into believing anything that is contrary to sound doctrine; the words contained in the prophetic word of God are CHOSEN and PRECISE; God is not a fool, he is more than capable of defining and expressing exactly what he intends to say without man adding or taking away from it.  THE SILENCE IS DEAFENING!!  The book of Revelation was written SOLELY for those saints that shall be on earth during it's fulfillment which is why EVERY true preacher and teacher of Gods word should be preaching and teaching on it in order to forewarn and prepare the saints for what is written concerning them.. Howe many preachers and teachers do you see or hear preaching this most IMPORTANT book?  THE PASTORS HAVE DESTROYED THE CHURCH;  The pastors have spiritually DESTROYED the church Jeremiah 12:10 and God shall recompense unto them for their wickedness and deceit Jeremiah 23:1-2 -- Jeremiah 23:32 -- Jeremiah 14:14 -- Jeremiah 23:25-26..  THE MYSTERY OF THE LAMB THAT SPEAKS AS A DRAGON;  There is a very specific reason why the book of Revelation depicts the 2nd beast as looking like a lamb but is really a dragon in disguise.  Revelation 13:11  And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.  The reason is that this entity is going to convince the world that he is the true Christ but in reality he is an IMPOSTOR.. Incredibly, Christ has forewarned that a false christ shall appear BEFORE his own return and he categorically states that we are NOT to believe or be deceived when this entity appears as him.  Matthew 24:25-27  Behold, I have told YOU before IT HAPPENS. Therefore if they shall say unto YOU, Behold, HE is in the desert; do NOT go forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; DO NOT BELIEVE IT. For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even unto the west; so shall ALSO the [TRUE] coming of the Son of man be. [IN HIS DAY].  Matthew 24:23   Then if any man shall say unto YOU, Lo, here is CHRIST, or there; DO NOT BELIEVE IT.  Mark 13:21   And then if any man shall say to YOU, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; BELIEVE HIM NOT:  What Christ is prophesying here is the coming of the DRAGON that shall appear as a LAMB, and which will subsequently deceive the whole world by the means of the incredible miracles that he has the power to perform and the world will be AMAZED at his powers!!  2 Thessalonians 2:9   Even him, whose coming is AFTER the working of Satan with all POWER and SIGNS and LYING WONDERS,  Revelation 13:13-14  And he does GREAT WONDERS, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And DECEIVES THEM that dwell on the earth [BY] the MEANS of THOSE MIRACLES which he had power to do in the sight of the beast;  THE MARK OF THE BEAST WILL ALTER HUMAN DNA;  The book of Revelation scriptures also reveal that this demonic entity deceives ALL those who worship the beast and take his mark; therefore whatever will be in his mark will make those who receive highly susceptible to his miracles, in other words he will have full power and spiritual control over them; it may well be that the mark of the Devil placed IN the hand or forehead will alter the DNA of those who willingly take it.  Revelation 19:20   And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought MIRACLES before him, [BY WHICH] he DECEIVED THEM that had RECEIVED the MARK of the BEAST, and THEM that WORSHIPED his IMAGE. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.  THE WISE SAINTS OF GOD WHO ARE GROUNDED IN THE BIBLICAL TRUTH OF HIS WORD SHALL NOT BE DECEIVED; HOWEVER THE LUKE WARM WILL BE TAKEN FROM GODS OPEN HAND!  Revelation 13:8   And ALL that dwell upon the earth SHALL worship him, whose names are NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.  Revelation 17:8   The beast that thou saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and THEY that dwell on the earth SHALL wonder, ALL whose names were NOT WRITTEN in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  Revelation 20:14-15  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And WHOEVER was not found WRITTEN in the book of life was CAST into the lake of fire.  THE SIGNS OF OUR TIMES ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE PROPHETIC TIME FRAME OF CHRISTS BIBLICAL RETURN;  Not knowing the prophesied signs of our times will cause those who lack to be defined as hypocrites. Christ called the Pharisees of his day hypocrites because they could not discern the signs of his coming as it was written of him that he should come to them and thus shall it also be likewise in our day when he shall appear the second time when hypocrisy once again shall cause many to stumble through lack of Godly knowledge and spiritual discernment..  Matthew 16:3   And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye HYPOCRITES, ye can DISCERN the face of the sky; but can ye CANNOT discern the SIGNS of these TIMES?  THE FALSE christ WILL BE ACCEPTED AS THE TRUE CHRIST BY THOSE WHO ARE EXPECTING AN UN-BIBLICAL RETURN BEFORE THE PROPHESIED APPOINTED TIME..  Just think about that! the pre-trib generation which amounts to the majority of modern day Christianity are awaiting to be snatched away; yet Christ forewarned that an impostor shall appear BEFORE his own second coming and shall work incredible miracles by which he shall deceive those who dwell upon the earth; what then do you think is going to happen to those who have rejected his true prophesied return AFTER the tribulation of the saints Matthew 24:29-30?  The truth and reality is that they shall NOT know the difference because they have rejected the biblical truth in order to believe a lie and an ideology that is contrary to the truth and Antichrist, therefore their savior shall be a DRAGON in the form of a LAMB!!  THOSE WHO ARE DESIRING TO SEE THE EARLY RETURN OF THE [TRUE] CHRIST SHALL NOT SEE IT; BUT THEIR FATE SHALL BE SEALED IN THE REJECTION OF HIS TRUTH..  Luke 17:22-25  And he said unto the disciples, The DAYS will come, WHEN ye shall desire to see [ONE] of the days of the Son of man, AND YE SHALL [NOT] SEE IT. And they shall say to YOU, See here; or, see there: DO NOT GO AFTER THEM, NOR FOLLOW THEM. For as the lightning, that shines out of the one part under heaven, shines unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.  THE WARNINGS ARE CLEAR; BUT THE SHEPHERDS ARE GONE ASTRAY.  Isaiah 56:11 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.  Amos 1:2   And he said, The Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.  Jeremiah 25:36  A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.  Ezekiel 34:8-10  As I live, saith the Lord God, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock; Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord God;  Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.  Proverbs 14:12   There [is] a way which [seems] right unto a man, but the [end thereof] are the ways of death.",

Pursuing someone in a relationship is far worse than pursuing someone who is not in a relationship, correct? And I am sure that you did not think to yourself \"I am changing my view now.\" That's not what people do. We find ways to forget, or to rationalize, to say \"That was different,\" and to ignore the pain we cause others. I am trying incredibly hard not to ignore that pain in you. You have been on both sides of the equation now. So you remember that process of justification and, probably, ignoring or rationalizing Steve's pain. Can you empathize, just a little? Since you have been there? I can't quite empathize with you, I can only sympathize.\n\nWhen we talked, I said that nothing would be undertaken lightly. I did not say that I wouldn't do anything. I said I had no plans. I was, in fact, very careful NOT to say that I would never do anything like what happened, just in case. Not that I had plans, like I told you. I just know that I am human, and humans do things that hurt other humans.\nMy point being that your views aren't exactly constant, and neither of mine. And that's how it is to be human.\n\nYes, you have hurt me. And I have hurt you. These things happen. Once again, we are human. I want to stress that point; humans do shitty things sometimes. We don't think, we lash out, we act irrationally and impulsively. It's part of us, for whatever reason.\n\nSo, this brings me to the question, and I want you to think about it and answer it honestly. Either answer is perfectly fine, and I will act in accordance to your wishes.\nDo you need to be alone because that is what you want right now? Or do you say that you need to be alone because you feel sad and isolated and like you cannot be around people without causing problems? In other words, would it help to know that you are loved and cared about very deeply by a great many people?\nBecause I am more than willing to answer your statement with \"no you don't. You need friends,\" if that's what you secretly, deep down, mean. But if you truly need to be alone, then I must be able to respect that. So let me know.\n"

Though she didn‚Äôt repeat her infamous ‚Äú17 intelligence agencies‚Äù lie, which she‚Äôd continued to regurgitate long after that claim had been conclusively debunked, there were still plenty of whoppers to be heard.  From her ridiculous claim that the aggressively protested DNC convention was ‚Äúvery positive‚Äù to her completely baseless claim that Bernie Sanders ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt explain his programs‚Äù during the primaries, Clinton did a fine job of reminding us all why the average American finds her about as trustworthy as a hungry crocodile. But while she has blamed her loss on James Comey and Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders and self-hating women and the media and uninformed voters and voter suppression and her campaign staff and the DNC and campaign finance laws and Jill Stein and the Electoral College and Anthony Weiner and sexism and Vladimir Putin, Hillary Clinton reserved the lion‚Äôs share of her deceit for the organization she hates most of all: WikiLeaks.

But that won‚Äôt be enough.

./conversations/udwanee-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Ahmed Wallan Muslim prayer ---------------  Muslim prayer is distinguished from other prayers for the owners of other faiths. It is obligatory and imposed.  Without it you will have destroyed religion, and if you have established it, you will have established the religion.  It is imposed and must be done by coercion  Prayer in all religions and other faiths  It is a free relationship in which there is no specific word that must be repeated and repeated  The Muslim prayer must be in the classical Arabic language and it is the language of Quran  While the people and owners of other religions pray in their local dialects and whatever their language  It is not a requirement that you keep certain verses and say them in a certain language  Malaysian or Chinese who does not know Arabic  It is obligatory to read the prayer in Arabic until it is valid.  Without even understanding what he says so he or she chants like a parrot  As if God would not understand the remaining languages.  It is all like a robot, you do things that are repeated and repeated like the machine exactly.  Prayer in other religions can be said in any language  Or even to say it in a group of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin one prayer.  The prayer of this spiritual relationship must be free and not by coercion or compulsion.  It is a relationship of ponder and thinking.  And not words repeated throughout the day as Al-Fatiha repeated by the Muslim at least 17 times a day  In the number of rak'ahs of the five prayers combined.  It is a relationship that must be a result of true love and desire, not coercion.  Either you are forced to pray  In a certain way  And at a certain time  And in a certain direction  In a certain way  And certain words  And in a certain language  And a certain number  And certain movements  This is the biggest dictatorship in worship  The simple delay of the Muslim about the prayer (Voyl him) so says by(Muhammad)in Quran chapter 107 verse 4and5:  4.So woe to the praying ones,  5 .Who are unmindful of their prayer!  If this threat is just a threat  For worshipers who may be slightly behind the prayer time imposed on them.  \"So what will happen to non-worshipers\"  And do not forget that it is not permissible to pray before the time of prayer even if five minutes  As if you are taking a appointment with the dentist, for example.",

./conversations/udwanee-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Ahmed Wallan Ten ways to make sure that God is a myth made by man  1- Political God  The human political system is based on a hierarchical order in which the authorities increase as we move up, beginning with the authority of the father at home until we reach the authority of the parliament, the government, the president or the king, and we find that each official depends on his control of the people on orders of higher rank. Humans invented something that has a higher authority than the king, so God called it to make it easier for the king to control the people in the name of higher authority, so we found Muhammad saying, \"Obey Allah and the Apostle and the Rulers of You.\" It is clear that Muhammad uses God as an element in a hierarchical political system.  2 - God curiosity  We always find in religions the God who follows and intervenes in every small and large in the lives of people. For example, Muhammad says about God, \"He is with you wherever you are.\" He also says about him: \"Do not leave small or large except counted.\" This curious nature is a human nature, I really care about assessing people based on the outcome of their lives.  3 - God is trivial  Trivialities does not end in the religions and the biggest vanity is what is the religion and what makes him a target for life, I mean worship and sanctification and veneration and praise to God and rituals that are meaningless and useless, was it not the first god that was present to ask the people to use their minds and their time in the benefit of humanity instead From wasting time in silly worship, God who cares to evaluate people based on the movements of their prayers and follow their words no doubt that he is a God of the manufacture of human minds.  4- The emotional God  God gets angry and is pleased and loves and hates and is hostile and rejoice and flaunts revenge and plotted and cheat and be patient and ruthless and gets paranoid and see the words of Muhammad \"when Asfona Antqmna them Vogrguenahm companions,\" This is a god with emotional decisions but it is a human invention and expresses the man who invented psychological.  5. The Human God  God is always in the religions paints in human beings, even in Islam, which is not allowed to draw God's Word in the modern recipe (I saw my Lord in the form of a young man glabrous frizzy him a green suit) and attributes of God in the Quran and Hadith of the hearing, sight, eye, hand and right fist paint him in the end image Closer to humanity, and this can not be explained, but God made the minds of humans so it was in their image, and if cats believe in God was never in the image.  6 - God the criminal  If any people God sent them collective punishment has not been subjected and exterminated with weapons of mass destruction, old and young, men and women, in the Koran, \"and if we want to drown the village ordered Mtrfaita Vvsagoa the right of them to say Vadmournaha destructive\" and where \"what I believed before them from the village Ohlknaha,\" This destruction Mass and collective punishments are human acts par excellence, for humans invented the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGod attributed to them the same means.  7-God is male  Always talk about God in the conscience of the masculine, the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGod mentioned, imagine the male, the male societies in which religions originated produced a male god, and produced religions biased against women, in the Koran \"and for men to degree.\"  8-God is the speaker  Speak of the qualities of human beings, God can communicate with humans without this human trait, but we noticed that all gods are dealing with human beings human words and languages ‚Äã‚Äãof human, causing a problem in communication and learning religions to those who are different language, but because God is a human industry, the one who made only find Speech to deliver his message.  9 - God racial  Every religion depicts God in the form of the race in which this religion originated. In Indian religions, we see the drawings of the gods in the image of an Indian. In Christianity he paints God as a white man. In Islam he did not paint but gave privileges to the Arabs as stated in the hadeeth: Chose the Arabs, then chose Arabs Quresha, then chose Quraish Bani Hashim, then chose me from Bani Hashem, I am the finest of the finest \"and saying:\" Caliphate in Quraysh. \"  10 - God the poor  God always needs money \"Who will lend God a good loan?\" In which mosque will you find a donation box? Why does God need money? Can not he save the money for his religion ?! This can only be explained by the fact that God is a human idea invented by some to collect people's money in their name.",

./conversations/akiva_greenfield-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Noah Greenfield I just learned of the passing of one of the most important and impactful educators in my life, my high school principal, on again and off again ◊ó◊ë◊®◊ï◊™◊ê, and friend, Rabbi  Dovid Landesman , ◊ñ◊¶◊≥◊≥◊ú. (And I emphasize the totally atypical but nevertheless astounding ◊¶◊ì◊ß◊ï◊™ of the man. See below.)  In elementary school and junior high, as a kid branded as a \"troublemaker\", I would daydream about having a \"cool\" principal, someone who wouldn't be a draconian disciplinarian, someone whose office wouldn't be synonymous with punishment, someone who would make school fun and interesting, someone who would see my precociousness (=smartassness) as a blessing instead of a nuisance.  My first memory of meeting Rabbi Landesman was on one of the first days of my 9th grade. I was cutting class. He was sitting outside, leaning against a wall, smoking. When he said hello, I thought, \"Oh no! I am busted!\" Half in terror, half kicking myself, we started chatting. About an hour later, he looked at his watch and said, \"We are both going to get in trouble if we don't head back to where we belong.\"   I don't remember what we spoke about, but I pretty quickly learned a few things:  1) Rabbi Landesman was genuinely interested in me, my opinions and the things I cared about (or thought I cared about.)  2) Rabbi Landesman was extremely fun. He was super smart, but amazingly capable of bringing complicated ideas down to a dumb ninth grader's level. He didn't have a shred of sanctimoniousness to him. He was willing to talk about anything, any time. No issues were off limits - indeed, thinking outside the box was encouraged.  3) Rabbi Landesman's educational philosophy was premised on respect, freedom and responsibility. He had to impose some rules on his school, but he kept them to a basic minimum. Having a meaningful conversation was more important than being bored in class.   This was the educator I had been waiting for!  Right away, Rabbi Landesman earned my trust and respect without ever demanding it. Virtually every conversation I had with him challenged me deeply - intellectually, spiritually, personally (even if I would rarely give him the pleasure of admitting it).   His classes were like nothing else. He would pick a fight - based on an idea, a social issue - and get everyone heated up, arguing about it. Sometimes he would present a resolution that was satisfying, often times he wouldn't. It made my brain hurt - I loved it. I would often come back, sometimes weeks later, to tell him why he was wrong. Whether he agreed or not, he couldn't hide the satisfaction of having gotten an idea to stick. He loved nothing more than students arguing with him - heated and engaged - about ideas.   On Saturday nights, after doing whatever stupid things I'd do with my friends, I would drive by his home. Often, he'd be out on his porch, sitting by himself, smoking, over a book. I'd sit with him and tell him about all the idiotic things I had just done and he'd laugh - often disapproving, but still laughing. He had a profound understanding and appreciation for youthfulness.  When I had girl issues, he was the voice of reason. I introduced him to every high school love interest and he even invited one (visiting from out of town) for dinner, which was both highly awkward and fantastic. I couldn't bring a girl over to meet my parents, but I sure as hell was going to introduce her to my rabbi!  I am pretty sure most everyone in my class had a similarly close and caring relationship with Rabbi Landesman. Some of us got in trouble more with him, some less. (There were certain things, like damaging school property or one another, being disrespectful to teachers, etc, that would bring his foot down really hard.) Some of us got turned on to his critical thinking and deep Jewish spirituality, others didn't. But there was unanimous love.   At our graduation, we all pitched in to give him a silver goblet as a token of appreciation for his overflowing dedication to us. It was absolutely heartfelt.  Rabbi Landesman kept in touch years after I graduated. We hung out whenever he visited Israel during my yeshiva years. He signed the ketubah at my wedding. He had done so much to shape me as a man, as a Jew, and to usher me into adulthood, I couldn't imagine him not playing an integral role at that critical moment in my life.  I am so lucky to have had him as a teacher and friend. I fervently pray that my children have mentors like him and I hope I can do my part to teach them what he so passionately transmitted to his students: love of life, love of Torah, love of God, and love for one another.  I am terribly saddened by his passing. ◊ë◊®◊ï◊ö ◊ì◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊î◊ê◊û◊™. ◊ô◊î◊ô ◊ñ◊õ◊®◊ï ◊ë◊®◊ï◊ö. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family. Shlomo Aaron Katz",

It's one of my character flaws, that I do try and be fair.  Granted I try and be fair according to my opinion but I do think that with being a liberal I still do strive to be fair.    These people seem to forget they lost the 1st Civil War 1861-1865.  They were having a fit, and this really was just an excuse, about a statue of Robert E. Lee being possibly taken down while, all the while carry their confederate/rebel flags while protesting.  The irony is so great.  I believe Robert E. Lee would be very disappointed by these people.  After all Robert E. Lee was the one who said the only place a confederate/rebel flag should be on display is in a museum.  He said this once the Civil War was over.  I posted in another response to a comment that this 64 year old white woman didn't bring myself out of my prejudices to have to fight for Civil Rights again.  Which now includes the right of Marriage Equality for the LGBTQI community and Women's right to have control over their bodies since these are under attack again by these abhorent administration.  But I will fight for Civil Rights for the discriminated against  in this country by a certain segment of this country's population.   I will fight for  everyone to have the same rights no matter their, race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. Yes this maybe a case where, not only will my flaw of being fair may not come out, but I don't intend to try to be fair.  I absolutely hate and despise trdumpster and, even more so since I have lived all my 64 years in Indiana, hate pence.  If I am ashamed and have regret of anything I have in my life IT'S NOT THAT I HAD AN ABORTION IN 1973 AT THE AGE OF 20.  IT'S THAT I DIDN'T GO TO THE ACLU IN 2015 WHEN PENCE SIGNED IN THE DISCRIMITORY RFRA INTO LAW AND FILE COMPLAINT AGAINST PENCE.  THAT I WAITED TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST PENCE UNTIL AFTER HE SIGNED INTO LAW HB 1337 IN 2016.  ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ANTI-ABORTION LAWS IN THE COUNTRY.

He was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the name of Johnny Cash, our father. We were sickened by the association.  Johnny Cash was a man whose heart beat with the rhythm of love and social justice. He received humanitarian awards from, among others, the Jewish National Fund, B‚Äônai Brith, and the United Nations. He championed the rights of Native Americans, protested the war in Vietnam, was a voice for the poor, the struggling and the disenfranchised, and an advocate for the rights of prisoners. Along with our sister Rosanne, he was on the advisory board of an organization solely devoted to preventing gun violence among children. His pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics. He would be horrified at even a casual use of his name or image for an idea or a cause founded in persecution and hatred. The white supremacists and neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville are poison in our society, and an insult to every American hero who wore a uniform to fight the Nazis in WWII. Several men in the extended Cash family were among those who served with honor.  Our dad told each of us, over and over throughout our lives, ‚ÄòChildren, you can choose love or hate. I choose love.‚Äô  We do not judge race, color, sexual orientation or creed. We value the capacity for love and the impulse towards kindness. We respect diversity, and cherish our shared humanity. We recognize the suffering of other human beings, and remain committed to our natural instinct for compassion and service.  To any who claim supremacy over other human beings, to any who believe in racial or religious hierarchy: we are not you. Our father, as a person, icon, or symbol, is not you. We ask that the Cash name be kept far away from destructive and hateful ideology.  We Choose Love.  Rosanne Cash  Kathy Cash  Cindy Cash  Tara Cash  John Carter Cash  August 16, 2017",
./conversations/vickie_dillon1-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Vickie Dillon Thank you Matt Behnke for sharing this...  Please copy & Share...  From an actual resident of Charlottesville:  \"There seems to be a perception from people outside of Charlottesville that what is going on here is two opposing groups coming to town and fighting some ideological battle that has gotten messy. That is not what is happening here.   What is happening here is that several hate groups from the extreme right have come together under the \"unite the right\" banner here in our town and basically started acting as terrorists. This may seem like an exaggeration but it's not.  A church service was held over because they had surrounded the building and police had to disperse them. People had to be escorted to their cars. My friend was there with her daughter. Everywhere they meet, businesses close. We had drive by shootings yesterday from a van marked kkk.  A car plowed into a huge group of people. I'm sure you saw that on the news feeds. What you probably didn't see is that some of those people were on their way back from helping to repel a white supremacist march to predominately black housing development a few blocks away where they were attempting home invasions. I guess they were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. The residents repelled that one before antifa got there but there is some video of the alt-right folks getting run off on the daily progress twitter feed, if you're interested.  So, basically, what I'd like you to understand is, this IS NOT two side egging each other on to unavoidable violence for more attention. This is one side of terrorists declaring that they can and will hold a town hostage (they've been saying it for over a month now, actually) and the town responding to that threat. The car that killed and injured people yesterday? Ohio tags.   The medic tents (which treated both sides... turns out the alt righters didn‚Äôt bring any medics. Guess they planned on doing all the injuring), water bottles, snacks, shade tents (all volunteer, donations, none shut down by police... all manned by that \"radical left\" you keep hearing about) yeah, we all live here. I saw a lot of people I knew yesterday, none of them were speaking for unite the right. None of them were escalating violence, most of them were offering some kind of aid and defending.\"",

Watching Law and Order: SVU (Special Victims Unit) on ION.  I wasn't always able to watch this when it was on NBC.  One of the episodes today was about a Nigerian immigrant.  It started out with them finding a body of a dead girl.  When the medical examined the girl it was found that she had been a victim of FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) at the age of 15.  We know that from two instances in Detroit, this year, it's still practiced covertly and some men won't even consider taking a wife who hasn't had FGM done.  It has been outlawed here in the United States and I several other countries but once again it's still done covertly.   This episode also dealt with Pologamy but that's a subject for another time.    It's sad that FGM is still an issue here.  I  am so tired of this shit.  I am tired of the nonsense that women aren't suppose to have sexual urges.  I am tired of the shit that women aren't suppose to act on those sexual urges.  I am so tired of the shit that men can do whatever the hell the want sexually.  That women are only on this planet to have children.  That sex is only for PROCREATION inside of marriage.  OBVIOUSLY THIS ALL ABOUT THE SAME OLD RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL BULLSHIT.  Now it was also portrayed that this was a christian family and the supposed christian 15 year old female wanted FGM done.  I AM SICK OF FEMALES BEING  CONSIDERED PROPERTY OF MEN.",

This is a follow-up to my comment of yesterday about the crying toddler at the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" 6pm showing at Cinemark in southern in Marion County.  The theatre refers to it as in Greenwood.  So I had other errands I had to due today so I went back by the theatre and asked to talk to the manager.  I told him that there needed to be an age limit on how young someone can be to be allowed into view a PG-13 movie.  He told me they couldn't refuse to let someone in.  Technically this is not true, I forgot about the poster in the ticket office window that says \"ANYONE UNDER 17 MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PARENT OR GUARDIAN\" to get into a \"R\" rated movie.  I asked for the number to call.  As I was leaving there was a bitch who was going into the theatre with a toddler in a stroller.  I decided to complain by paper.  I tried to file my complaint through their website and it wouldn't go through.  So guess what I AM GOING TO SEND A COMPLAINT TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE.  The manager told me that the corporate office won't change their policy but I am still going to file the complaint.  I so tired of the BREEDERS thinking that they have a right to do whatever they want JUST BECAUSE THEY BREED AND POPPED OUT SOME RAT BASTARD KID!!!!!!!!!",

./conversations/prillaortiz-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Blake Worthington Tomorrow I will be voting in favor of the New York State Constitutional Convention, regardless of how many bumper stickers I have seen and billboards that are blindly telling everyone to vote against taking the opportunity for the state and we the people to amend our constitution, which hasn‚Äôt been revised since 1938!   ‚ÄúThe unique democratic purpose of New York‚Äôs periodic constitutional convention referendum is to implement New Yorkers‚Äô inalienable right to alter their constitution in cases where the interests of the legislature and people conflict. New York‚Äôs Constitution allows the people to exercise this right once every twenty years.‚Äù  Yes, you read that right. WE THE PEOPLE only get the chance to make amendments to our constitution once every 20 years AND we haven‚Äôt been able to do so since 1938!  This massive campaign against the Constitutional Convention is all based off of fear- mongering. Threatening the labor and teachers unions that they‚Äôre going to take away their rights‚Ä¶ threatening environmentalists that amendments will be passed to clear-cut the Adirondacks‚Ä¶   Well, I‚Äôll tell you something‚Ä¶ if I saw the people of New York vote to pass a law clear cutting the Adirondacks or taking away the rights of labor and teacher unions, I would have to seriously consider whether New York local elections were reflecting the actual will of the people of New York and not other entities with more financial and political control. That would seriously make me think that the system is even more broken and more corrupt than we think it is.  Any campaign that is based off of fear-mongering should automatically be a red flag. The idea of threatening the people into being afraid of making positive or progressive change and taking control of their own governance, which is what a democracy is- A GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE,  indicates that somewhere there are people and entities behind the scenes that the system currently is working for quite well and they don‚Äôt want it to change. I know a couple entities offhand that I can tell you the system is working VERY well for- and it certainly doesn‚Äôt include the middle class, the lower class, the working class or the environment of New York.  You know who the system is currently working perfectly for? Wall Street- which is obviously based out of New York, Corporations, the insurance companies, the banks, the pharmaceutical companies which continue to pump millions of opiates onto our streets and into our kids which is the root cause of the New York State heroin epidemic, the chemical companies that continue to sell pesticides to the NYS agricultural industry, the Oil industry and the governmental body in which most politicians are out for their own gains and serve the sole purpose of keeping this state and this country from being a true democracy by keeping the People separated and uninvolved in their own governance.   Giving the people a chance to go to convention and revise the outdated and antiquated 1938 NYS Constitution would of course give corporate New York a giant scare. What if we passed a law to ban fracking? How would that affect the oil industry? What if we passed laws restraining the influx of highly addictive opiates into our state leading to one fatal heroin overdose A DAY on long island? What if we passed laws like other states have that doctors who treat Lyme cannot be punished by law and that the testing for Lyme Disease, since we‚Äôre at ground zero, needs to be infinitely more accurate? What if we passed a law that doctors who treat cancer holistically would be safe from punishment by law?  What if we passed laws protecting our wetlands, water table and surrounding environment from extremely harmful and dangerous pesticides which remain legal in the state? What if we passed laws about restraining the obscene insurance rates in the State of New York and restricting the denial of coverage with regards to oftentimes life-threatening issues to millions of New Yorkers? What if we made a law raising the minimum wage so that 16 PERCENT OF NEW YORKERS WEREN‚ÄôT LIVING IN POVERTY???? THAT‚ÄôS FUCKING ABYSSMAL. And that‚Äôs just for starters.  There is such an incredible amount of highly relevant issues that WE THE PEOPLE need to address that exist now, but did not exist in 1938, it is absolutely ludicrous that we should vote not to make changes to our constitution. Additionally, based on these considerations it is safe to say that it is therefore HIGHLY PLAUSIBLE to assume that there are vastly powerful entities out there that would have an particular motive in mind and the financial means and political sway necessary to generate a major campaign against something like the constitutional convention, and the calculated intelligence to make that campaign look like it came from somewhere else by insidiously infiltrating organizations like unions where it would be very easy to prey upon the group mentality.  Look around you at people here on Long Island and in New York State. Is anyone you know really doing great? Because to me it looks like everyone is poor, sick and barely making ends meet. On the other hand it looks like the Corporations, the Banks, the Insurance Companies, the Medical Industry, the Drug Companies, the Oil Industry, the Chemical companies- they‚Äôre all doing fucking great. And you know why? Its because there is nothing in our state Constitution OR our federal constitution that protects WE THE PEOPLE or the ENVIRONMENT from these gigantic, billion dollar greed machines. Corporations did not exist in they way they do now in 1938. The environmental crisis did not exist the way it does now in 1938. There was no lyme disease, no heroin epidemic, no mass mental health crisis that exists now in 1938. And so obviously the constitution does not address these highly relevant matters.  But actually you know what? Let‚Äôs just all continue to be disconnected from our own government and use an outdated constitution that doesn‚Äôt address any of these REAL concerns that are happening NOW in 2017. Lets let them continue to scare us away from creating real, positive and relevant change by threatening us that they‚Äôll try to take away whatever minimal rights we have. Because behind closed doors they‚Äôre taking them away anyway- and it‚Äôs happening quickly and secretly, and if we don‚Äôt stop buying all these fear-based propaganda campaigns and failing to do our own research and failing to use our own brains the situation is going to continue to get exponentially worse as every single day goes by.  So no matter how many bumper stickers and billboards some group behind the scenes decided to push out into the teachers unions and labor unions and under environmentalist‚Äôs noses, threatening me with clear cutting the Adirondacks isn‚Äôt quite enough to make me decide to vote for a system that continues to allow the snakes at the top to reap all the wealth for themselves, while I sit here and watch my friends and family suffer and die so they can continue to make loads of money and perpetuate a corrupt system.

California is not really in a drought.   Asbestos is safe to use in buildings.  Ebola transmits more easily than Obama and the CDC are telling you.  Vaccines cause autism and doctors are lying to you about it.  Global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese.  Net neutrality is a plot to target conservative media.  Justice Scalia was murdered.  Ted Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination.  The 9/11 terrorists had family and friends in America who knew about the attack in advance. (Made up to justify his proposed war crime of executing family members of terrorists.) Thousands of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated on 9/11.  ‚ÄúVirtually 100%‚Äù of mosques in America preach hate.   US foreign policy once permitted war crimes against Muslims demonstrated by a (bogus) anecdote about an American general in the Philippines massacring captive Muslims with bullets washed in pigs‚Äô blood.   Obama was born in Kenya.  Obama was born ‚ÄúBarry Soetero‚Äù.  Obama murdered a Hawaiian official to hide the truth about his birth.  Obama is a Muslim.  Obama wears a ring with an Arabic inscription.  Obama supports Islamic terrorism.  Obama sent arms to ISIS.  Bill Ayers wrote ‚ÄúDreams from My Father‚Äù.  Obama never attended Columbia.  Obama started the fraud case against Trump University for political reasons.  Obama plans to bring 250,000 Syrian refugees to America. (It‚Äôs actually 10,000.)    Most Syrian refugees are young men. (Most are women and children.)  Syrian refugees have cell phones provided by ISIS.   Syrian refugees are not vetted. (The US vetting process takes about 2 years.)  Obama is placing Syrian refugees in Republican states only.   Christians are currently banned from entering the USA. Only Muslims are allowed.  Christianity is being ‚Äúshut-down‚Äù by the US government.  There are no lobbying groups for Christians, only for Muslims.  The IRS is auditing him because he is a ‚Äústrong Christian‚Äù.  Obama will sign an executive order taking away your guns, and Hillary will abolish the 2nd Amendment.  Obama and Hillary will release violent offenders from prison (after they take away your guns).   Blacks kill 81% of white homicide victims. (It's 15%.)  Oakland and Ferguson are among ‚Äúthe most dangerous cities in the world‚Äù. (Not even close.)  Illegal immigrants are mostly dangerous criminals.   Latin American governments send their worst people to the USA.  The Obama Administration is funding illegal immigration.  There are 34 million illegals in the country today. The estimate of 11 million is a lie.  Obama manipulated government statistics on deportations.   Obama ordered the border patrol to let everyone in without question.  There is massive voter fraud in US elections.  Obama won in 2012 due to voter fraud.  Obama is lying about the drop in the number of uninsured under Obamacare.  Obama made a deal with the Saudis to flood the market with oil and drop gas prices during the 2012 election.  Obama is lying about the unemployment rate. The real rate is 25-42%.  The Clintons murdered Vince Foster.  Hillary Clinton caused the deaths at the embassy in Benghazi. Andy Lutz Doug",

But I know they are not meaning it in a demeaning way so I don't say anything and give them grace. Hopefully grace can be given all around but I agree: EVERYONE needs to stop using those silly pet names, especially with strangers!",
./conversations/chessie_black-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Nicole Stamp Today my timeline is full of decent men asking, \"How can I help?\", in the wake of the viral  # MeToo  movement created by  www.twitter.com/TaranaBurke .  I'm going to take this question as sincere, and give a few suggestions.  Here are some concrete ways men* can help:  (*I wrote this specifically for a small group of my own male friends who were explicitly asking for advice after being stunned by the ubiquity of the #metoo abuse hashtag. I wasn't anticipating this being shared so many times. These tips can be used by people of all genders.)  1. Practice these phrases: \"That's not cool\" and \"That's a shitty thing to say\".  Say them to other men who are saying disrespectful things to or about women.   2. Follow some feminist writers on social media. Sometimes what they write may seem \"exhausting\" or \"too angry\". Put aside that discomfort because that feeling is your male privilege allowing you to disengage from an important conversation that womxn don't get to disengage from. Here are some accounts I like- but there are lots. Follow a few.   www.twitter.com/ijeomaoluo   www.twitter.com/manwhohasitall   www.twitter.com/FeministaJones  3. Boost female voices. When there's an issue and you're going to share an article about it- especially if it's a gender issue- take a minute and try to find one written by a woman (same goes for other marginalized groups- seek articles about race written by IBPOC, seek articles about disability by writers with disabilities*, etc. \"Nothing about us, without us\").  (*I originally said \"disabled writers\". Thanks to a commenter for reminding me that \"person-first\" language is considered more respectful in certain disability communities).  4. Boost what women say at work. Listen for men dismissing women's contributions and make a habit of listening and saying things like \"Hey Zahra has a point\".  5. Be mindful of how you introduce women- particularly at work functions. Role-model extra respect into your introductions. So often you hear men being introduced with job titles and accolades, and women introduced as \"the lovely\" or \"the beautiful\". I guarantee that no matter how good she looks, she'd rather be introduced by her job title and accomplishments.   Relevant Washington Post article: \"At conferences, male doctors are introduced as \"Doctor Whoever\" 72% of the time; female doctors are introduced using the word \"Doctor\" only 49% of the time.\"  http://wapo.st/2kSWlba    Doing this subtly tells the listener that the women's qualifications are lesser-than. Go out of your way to correct this by introducing women (and others from marginalized groups- racialized, disabled, young-looking, whatever) using their full job titles and accolades.  6. At work or out in the world, don't call female colleagues or strangers cutesy diminutive names like \"honey, baby, darling, kiddo, young lady, sweetheart, girl, or dear\". This is a subtle way of putting them down, elevating your own status over them as a man who is choosing to vote them as attractive, and reminding them and all present that they're just cute little ladies that nobody should listen to.   At work, make a special effort to speak to women using the kind of person-to-person respectful address you use when speaking with male colleagues. Hint: Use their name. If you slip up and call your colleague \"young lady\" or some other bullshit like that, it's cool to say something about it, like \"I'm sorry I called you that- it's disrespectful.\"  7. Seek enthusiastic consent in your sexual encounters. If you're having sexy time and the other person stops reciprocating, gets quiet, seems tense or stiff, avoids making eye contact, pauses, or otherwise slows the tempo of the encounter, then you should.... STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING.   Reframe how you think of consent. You're not supposed to just \"go for it\" until someone yells NO and that's when you stop. That's old-fashioned and gross. And she might not be able to explicitly say no, because she has very likely been assaulted before and she might freeze when stressed- that's a side effect of all this \"me too\".   People shouldn't have to explicitly say no.  Instead, slow down. At every step, listen with your ears (or ask with your words) for the word \"yes\", and then you can escalate the encounter together. Seek explicit and enthusiastic and active consent before you proceed. Proceed together. And constantly observe the other person's body language for the hesitations that mean \"no\".  If this means you have to cut down on alcohol or substances to stay present and have self-control, please do that.  8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Bitch, cunt, slut, pussy, f*g, girly, sissy, cuck, etc. Use insults that work on everyone rather than insults that specifically target the feminine as weak, lesser, and undesirable. \"Asshole\" is a nice multipurpose choice- we all have one.  9. If there are little boys, teen boys, and young men in your life, role-model that the feminine is not less-than. Challenge them on their dismissive ideas around what counts as \"girl stuff\". Buy them a doll. Paint your nails together. Show up wearing pink. Do something that's coded as* traditionally \"feminine\" in a way that embraces the feminine as a valid way of being, not in a way that mocks femininity. Buy them books and watch TV and movies that prominently feature female characters. Verbally challenge their stereotypes about what men do and how women are lesser. Seeing women as people starts in infancy.   (*Thanks to a commenter for pointing out that behaviours aren't inherently fem/masc, but rather we code them as such).  10. Be wary of constantly or only telling little girls they're pretty and cute or commenting on their hairstyle & clothing. I know, little girls often wear fun stuff and it's easy to comment on. But it tells her, and the little boys nearby, that girls should be valued first and foremost for their looks.   Instead, try things like \"What kind of toy is that? That looks fun, what is it? Are you reading any good books? What's your favourite subject in school? What kind of things do you like to do? Do you have a favourite animal? May I ask your advice, should I purchase the apples or the grapes?\" There are so many things to talk about.  11. When a woman is walking alone and you end up walking behind her- especially in dark or secluded areas- please slow down to increase the distance between you, or, better yet, cross the street. Literally go out of your way to help her feel that you're not following her.  12. Teach your elders to do better. Pervy Grandpa and Racist Grandma might seem harmless at Xmas dinner but as their health declines, they will largely end up being cared for by women and POC who don't deserve dehumanizing treatment. Call it out. You can teach old dogs* new tricks, and you should definitely try.   (*Someone below pointed out that this metaphor, equating the elderly to dogs, is disrespectful. I agree with them. I'm not deleting it because hiding mistakes is creepy. I'm sorry I spoke disrespectfully about elderly people- that's a proverb that I'll quit using.)  13. Don't argue so much in conversations around types of oppression that you don't personally experience. Keep an eye open for our culture's gross habit of putting the onus on the oppressed persons to dredge up their pain for inspection (only for us to then dismiss it as \"just one instance which they probably either caused or misinterpreted anyway\"). Instead, try this- if you don't believe something is an issue, use the Googles. Find, say, three articles *written by people in that demographic*, and read them. Look for patterns in their analyses. You'll find that these ideas aren't weird militant fringe notions- oppression is a widely-accepted and statistically-supported phenomenon and a lot of insightful people are talking about it. Avoid the hot takes and go to the source- the people who experience the issue firsthand.  14. If you feel uncomfortable during conversations about sexism (or racism, or ableism, or cultural appropriation, or whatever- because all these systems are related, google \"kyriarchy\" and \"intersectionality\" to learn more), the only correct response is to be quiet and listen and try to focus on the topic at hand rather than centre your own feelings. It's hard. It's worthwhile.  Thanks for trying to be decent men. We see you.

We hit a stopping point waiting on Great Hearts to make a financial commitment. My partner and owner of the company has approached investors before but sounded like he wants to make it on his own until we have a success product with at least one school system. I had to go an get another full time job since we don't want to spend a bunch of time on features until we know it works.\n\nI think with social networks we are down to 3 degrees of Kevin Bacon.\n\nI am applying my skills to some new projects now as this is my first time in true corporate America. It is amazing how slowly things move compared to Lean Startups. I am trying to learn how the overall vision of a long term company makes it in front of their customers.\n\nWe have a little Airbnb business, my wife is an artist and painter going to school for cosmetology and aesthetics. I have a side gig setting up a new marketing site for thesosmethod.com. Lots of irons in the fire but I don't see a way to make my ideas a global resource and live off of it so in the meantime I am trying to learn as much as possible.\n\nAs it turns out, I still get to do whatever I want in corporate America, I just have to convince 3 extra managers first ;)\n",

Let's do a mathematical trick with the number 1150055:  Take the first three digits: 115.  Multiply it by 80 (115 * 80 = 9200)  Now add 1 (9200 + 1 = 9201)  Multiply by 250 (9201 x 250 = 2300250)  Add in the last four digits twice (2300250 + (0055 * 2) = 2300360)  Substract 250 (2300360 - 250 = 2300110)  Divide by 2 and... you've got the original number!: 1150055  Calculating the determinant associated to the number 01111500559:  | 1 1 1 |   The determinant of the matrix: | 1 5 0 | = 25  | 0 5 5 |   Someone born on 0/0/55 would be probably 62 years old.  People's age matters! People act and are targeted differently depending on their age. For instance: any insurance company in UK could cover you with this age. Low insurance quotes. At the same time, this kind of people is the most active in technology terms, and they usually have a cellphone. Mobile users under 30 use also mobile services like ringtone and game downloads.  You could write that number using Roman numerals this way: XI(011) CXV(115) LV(0055)  ... or maybe this other way: XI (011) CXV (115) (00) LV (55)  The Roman Empire did not have insurance companies, so romans didn't have life insurances or health insurances either. No insurance quotes to be paid or whatever. Undoubtely, those were better times... despite the existence of roman lawyers.  They didn't use cell phones either. Much quieter life. Communications was done though alive messengers, such as slaves and carrier pidgeons, writing down in parchment paper and conveniently sealed.  The number converted to binary is: 1000010010000000010011100001111  01 + 11 + 15 + 00 + 55 = 82  8 + 2 + = 10  1 + 0 = 1  The Number Seven is a powerful source of magic and has been related with religions since the start of time.

Then, I asked him how a child like me can be an achievement for someone like him that has achieved a lot of successes which always and forever makes me proud of him...  He replied: My greatest accomplishment can only be what I immortalize after my death...  Then, I did not understand how I can be an achievement for someone else and I did not even do any noteworthy achievement, but he told me to wait till I become elder and understand...  But do any of you wondered one day why we may decide to wait ...?!  Why wait for people who were late with or without excuses...?!  Why do we hate endings even the happy ones...?!  We adore waiting...  Our life has become only a convince in us to be eternal...  We forget too often that we're going to die...  We postpone all we have to do for tomorrow as we are sure it is certainly coming...  After a little thought and a lot of reflection, I see that we no longer believe in anything...  Our faith became intraday like a fun modern songs or _using more specific words_ I might describe it as just a motive of enthusiasm mixed with passion...  We see only narrower horizons and do not even believe that the end may be hiding in the folds of these narrow horizons...  We became not seeing anything ...  We live as owners of the goals, investigators for them, and so proud of that, but we miss what is greater than the concept of \"goal\" which is \"purpose\"...  Minutes and seconds pass and we think that the coming time is only similar to the past and we may to do what we had to do before that in it...  We get to what they call \"middle age,\" I do not know how they have set this name as if they knew that man will live like his age again...  We may get to the \"early twenties\" and think about what we spent half of our lives _as they say_ to achieve and we do not see anything...  Even if we have seen some of what we consider to be a self-success or achievement, rarely someone of us think about how he benefited others and how his memory is going to spend eternity ...  Only now I understand what you said, my dad, and I bear witness that you were right...  Really my greatest accomplishment in this life can not be accomplished in the past as what is accomplished in the past have passed and been left right there...   # To_be_working_on_the_future See Translation",

Douglas Adams was an unabashed computer nerd and knew a heck of a lot about programming languages and coding.In programming, an asterisk is commonly used to translate as ‚Äòwhatever you want it to be‚Äù - and in ASCII language, the most basic computer software, ‚Äú42‚Äù is the designation for an asterisk. A computer, Deep Thought, was asked what the true meaning of life was and it answered as a computer would‚Ä¶ ‚Äú42‚Äù = ‚Äúanything YOU want it to be.‚Äù - Pure Genius!"

What you didn't know though is that I've been in the IT field now for over 9 years and have had a very profound exposure to many different facets and technologies. Currently, I'm a hired gun doing some BA work for a large healthcare provider and we're coming up with some great technology solutions to tackle the challenges of a growing and changing healthcare landscape. Prior to this though, I was working on a software release team in Denver, Colorado. One of the best companies I've ever had the pleasure to be a part of. A true agile shop that is making their name for themselves in a big way in the Web Conferencing sphere. I've also done quite a bit of the QA and automated testing for a few large companies, and even dabbled in some front-end design and product ownership roles. Each new challenge has brought on new rewards and increased my knowledge and my passion for the IT field.I try to bring everything I have to the table. Over my tenure I've been able to interact with a vast array of technologies and methodologies, I'll include just a snapshot of buzzwords that apply to my skill set: Agile, Lean, Kanban, ,NET, Java, JS, Bootstrap, WebStorm, HTLM5, Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Stash, Selenium, Term2 and then of course my enterprise level (Waterfall) experience using  LoadRunner, Quality Center, Salesforce, MS Visio (and the rest of the MS Office Suite), and Visual Studio. In a nutshell, I'm passionate about technology and how it can create solutions to existing problems. I love working with teams and collaborating together to come up with innovative ideas. And in the interest of full disclosure, I hate the word \"Synergy\". And that is pretty much me in a nutshell. Cheers.\n  \n  \n",

./conversations/gemma_tenedero_1-posts-2017.json:        "description": "A Spiritual Journey with Jesus, The Divine Mercy  added  4 new photos . The Healing Power of Gratitude  26 Oct 2017  The Lord has taught me a mystery about the healing power of gratitude. I pray that this reflection will bless you with inspiration and fill you with peace and joy.  In a hectic, fast paced world we don‚Äôt always ‚Äúlive in the moment‚Äù. ‚ÄúLiving in the moment‚Äù is to me like quietly savoring the flavor of a fine wine. You need to enter into the experience with a gentle persistence that fills you with awareness and understanding.   When we live in the moment we are usually more aware of the blessings that surround us.  Let‚Äôs try to put this into practice right now.  Pause for a moment to consider that this opportunity for us to connect is enabled by technology. Let us give thanks for the opportunity that technology affords for communication, sharing, learning, entertainment, friendship and growth be it personal or professional. Hundreds of years ago it would not have been possible for us to connect like this, so let‚Äôs thank God for the innovation that technology allows for.  I personally believe that God is at the center of all that is beautiful and that all gratitude should be given to Him, the source of every blessing.  ‚ÄúEvery good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.‚Äù James 1:17  If you believe that God is the source of all that is good, then know that there is an opportunity for each of us to see His divine fingerprints everywhere if we choose to look for them!  As we enter the end of October in many places in our world, God is recoloring the landscapes. The trees that were once green in color are now different shades of yellow, orange and red. I rejoice in nature and in its many different and wonderful manifestations. At night I often hear the howling of coyotes and wolves in the forest surrounding our house.  Our neighbour has placed motion-activated cameras in the woods, so I know we have a large bear back there too.  I have seen the photos and I would be so grateful Lord that he does not come too close to our house!  I don‚Äôt take our freedom, peace and security for granted. I am mindful that many people are living in conflict zones and they are listening to the sounds of guns and bombs, as they fear for their safety. Let‚Äôs be grateful for our freedom and peace and continue to pray for an end to war and violence.  I am of the opinion that an ‚Äúattitude of gratitude‚Äù needs to be cultivated. For most of us it doesn‚Äôt come naturally. It literally needs to be sparked by a persistent focus on the many blessings in our life. If we choose to focus on ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs missing‚Äù in our life, we will be insufficiently grateful for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs present‚Äù that is enriching our life in some way.  Pause throughout your day to say little prayers of thanks to God and watch how these prayers have a healing power on your life.  Watch how they spark joy and peace in your heart.  A number of years ago I introduced a prayer before our family meals, i.e.,  ‚ÄúThe Prayer called Grace‚Äù. We always stop now before we eat to say thank you to God for our meal, our health, God‚Äôs love etc. Our prayer reflects whatever we are experiencing in that day and we try to remember to pray for those in need.  I believe true gratitude always motivates charity. If we are really grateful we will give back as a sign of our gratitude. For example as we give thanks for not being hungry, we should consider helping charities that offer assistance to the poor and needy.  ‚ÄúThose who give to the poor will lack nothing, but those who close their eyes to them receive many curses.‚Äù Proverbs 28:27  The Bible is a great source of joy to me. To reflect on God‚Äôs Holy Word is at the heart of my life. I am grateful that the Bible was translated into my native tongue, English. There were many people who fought for the translation of the Bible. I am grateful their advocacy and struggle and hard work gave us the opportunity to savour God‚Äôs Word as a light that leads us onto holy paths.  ‚ÄúYour word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.‚Äù  Psalm 119:105  I have had the privilege to sponsor some children in the developing world.  We pay for their school fees so they can go to school. I recall so many times as my own children were growing up they would chant ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to go to school!‚Äù but my sponsor children write to me about how grateful and how very, very happy they are to be able to learn and go to school.  Why is it that gratitude emerges so easily when we find something or someone we love is missing in our life?  We say ‚Äúoh how grateful I would be to have them back!‚Äù  Suddenly we are so aware of a vacant space in our heart, a hole that longs to be filled.  As I was praying for God‚Äôs inspiration to help me with this reflection, I felt God saying to my heart that what‚Äôs most important is not so much ‚Äúwhat to be thankful for‚Äù;  the most important thing is to learn ‚Äúhow to be thankful‚Äù. If we learn ‚Äúhow‚Äù to be thankful we will begin to notice that ‚Äúwhat to be thankful for‚Äù is all around us!  It is God‚Äôs grace and Holy Spirit that teaches us to see the blessings in our life.  I believe that spiritual transformation is enabled by many moments of gratitude that illumine our hearts and minds with a realization and an appreciation of God‚Äôs providence. A life devoid of gratitude is to me like food without spices; that life is bland and tasteless. The Spirit of God is like a gently breeze, it is discerned by some and not felt by others.  Let us pray for the Holy Spirit of Gratitude, a Spirit that will awaken us to being truly thankful for the things and people and opportunities that enrich our life‚Äìall holy blessings from God.  One of the sacred experiences I treasure which I know is subject to some controversy is the Mass. Some people I know no longer go to Church because they feel that the sins of priests have caused Jesus to ‚Äúexit‚Äù from the Sanctuary. Let‚Äôs reflect on the Word of God seeking truth and wisdom.  Before Jesus died He celebrated a sacred meal with His apostles, a meal commonly referred to as ‚ÄúThe Last Supper‚Äù.  Jesus ‚Äútook bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ‚ÄúThis is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù Luke 22:19  Jesus said, ‚ÄúWhoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them.‚Äù John 6:54-56  Following the Death, Resurrection and Ascension of Jesus, the Apostles did as Jesus requested and St. Paul warned them to be careful: ‚ÄúEveryone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.‚Äù 1 Corinthians 11:29  In the Sacrament of the Eucharist, which we celebrate in the Mass, we must discern the Body of Christ or drink judgment on ourselves. The presence of Jesus in the Sacrament of Love is not a function of the sanctity of the Priest, it is the exclusive work of the Holy Spirit that transforms ordinary bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus.  When we receive Jesus in the Eucharist with faith and thanksgiving, we give praise and glory to God.  Sometimes my Catholic friends say that the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù or the ‚Äúhomily‚Äù (i.e., priest‚Äôs sermon) ‚Äútakes away‚Äù from their positive experience of the Mass. To this I would say, ‚Äúlet nothing get between you and Jesus‚Äù. Jesus waits for us in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. It is the Work of the Holy Spirit of God that gives us this blessing and let nothing and no one taint it with any form of disappointment!  Bride of Christ receive your Holy Lord and do this in remembrance of the Holy One, Jesus Christ, who gave everything up to create a place for you in Paradise and to destroy the power of sin in your life today!  With wonder, awe and reverence let us approach this miracle of love‚ÄìJesus in the Holy Eucharist.  Let us be grateful for this time we have on earth for it is an opportunity to show God how much we love Him. Let us not take anything for granted. Let‚Äôs give thanks for everything: the food that graces our tables, our shelter, our clothing, our water, our jobs, our health, our healthcare and so many natural remedies, the music and artistic expression that adds beauty to our world.  Let‚Äôs give thanks for our freedom, for peace in our life, for the friends and family that help us to grow in love. Let‚Äôs rejoice in the simple things‚Äîa moment to laugh, to smile, to learn, to pray, to give, to share, to forgive, to be forgiven, to love and to live in God‚Äôs presence, for Him, with Him and in Him.  Thank You for Your love Jesus! Thank You for the gift of faith. Thank You for being willing to die for us! Thank You for guiding me and teaching me and being willing to live in an intimate relationship with me. I savor this time with You as a foretaste of the heaven we will have forever. Please guide us to do Your Holy Will and to treat all the gifts around us as treasures of Your love.  I will stop every day Lord @ the Time you died for us, 3pm, to remember Your Passion and to pray for all souls, that all people will come to know you and love you.  This daily moment of thanksgiving fills my heart with holy desire to please You Jesus!  You are my heart‚Äôs desire.  Without You I am nothing!  Please join me friends of Jesus in a daily prayer for peace @ the time Jesus died for us, 3pm (each of us in our local time zones).

To me in a Leo, I've never seen someone with a bigger, more liberal outward caring heart. They are not afraid to open up and introduce others at parties, make people feel welcome and at home, and just such warm intentions in general. They may lack a bit on the inside as they are Yang, but even in that, I look at them as one of the more considerate Yang signs.    They are in my eyes the most family orientated of the yang signs and more than some of the yin signs. Can't forget, where you have one Leo, he or she has a pack! That pack is the loved one(s) and many Cubs that they are fiercely protective over.     As far as traits go, I loom at them pretty rounded. People born in Leo are very blessed. But their strengths are that they are very outgoing, full of warmth, physical strength and passion. They set their mind to it, there is nothing they can't accomplish. As far as careers go, generally all, but they are definitely making the best performers and ANY job with high end hospitality with expert people skills; bartenders, servers, flight attendants.     As bosses, as long as they can be who they are and not someone they truly aren't, they are well loved. When they feel they have to be a boss they don't want to be, is when they will hate their job and they will carry that bad energy outwards and it will be like them against the world. Even then, they don't give up and so they will continuing plot to make clever moves out of a bad spot for themselves and anyone they keep their love with. The one thing to love about them is they are determined to be happy, stay happy and in turn make others happy as well.

It continues to be a fantastic idea, however, the progress on the robot has slowed to a halt and nothing is being done.\n\nBy not completing the robot, or even creating a little progress at all, we are making ACM a laughing stock among the other engineering clubs who, as it's been pointed out to me, have been able to finish a wide variety of projects, and is severely hurting our chances at future funding and other generous contributions from the CS department, like room 105.\n\nI've figured out that no one actually wants to build the robot anymore, and that the people who were interested in it have graduated and have left the club with a several thousand dollar liability that we can't hand off to anyone. People don't want to work on it for the following reasons:\n\n1. It's a huge project and no one has the time to commit to it\n2. No one is confident enough in their technical skills to build it\n3. No one wants their name on it if it fails or sucks.\n\nSo, in order to combat these problems I've come up with the idea of \"Robot Building Days!\" (catchier name coming soon)\n\nThe idea is to advertise one weekend a month where anyone with any degree of skill and from any major, ACM member or not, can come to room 105 and contribute to building a robot! They can work on the hardware, the software, the ideas, or just anything that needs to be worked on really, while snacking on free food and learning valuable skills. They can work as much or as little as they like and they're not liable for any failures.\n\nWhat I need are experienced and incredibly talented technical people to come in ONE day the entire semester, and help these people assemble the robot. The degree of participation you contribute is up to you, it can range from actually building it to sitting on the couch and answering questions. I just need someone to guide the noobs in their attempt at robot building.\n\nI don't need more commitment right now other than \"I would be willing to do this once, on a saturday or sunday (whatever you want) this semester.\"\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested or willing to help get us out of this mess, if you're willing to do it more than once, and if you require further convincing (a.k.a. bribe). Also, if you know someone else who might be interested, send them my way. \n\nONE day for the ENTIRE semester, when it's most convenient for YOU.\n\nPlease help.\n\n-Meaghan\n"

It would have a far greater impact on society than forcing your own unique interpretations of spirituality and morality on others.   Your outrage about naked breasts or naughty words on television doesn't feed hungry kids.   Your pearl clutching fainting about gender roles doesn't stop violence against women.   Your finger wagging and scolding doesn't adopt a child.  I believe your heart hurts from these things, but it's easier to pretend to be outraged about unwed mothers or alcohol sales on Sunday than putting your money and sweat where your mouth is.  You do this for yourself, to make yourself feel better the easiest way possible. That's why that noise is the loudest, and gets the most attention. That's why the rants posted fighting equality for supposed moral reasons are the longest from the same people who sit on their hands while the world burns.  I'm not a religious man, but I work with a lot of good people who are. I respect them because they are honest in their intentions, are respectful of others views, and they are willing to work with anyone to shape a better world. They believe it.  Believe whatever you want, but if you don't have actions to back up your hand wringing, I can't take you seriously. You only do it to make yourself feel better. It's selfish. Bryant Hileman",

Senior citizens are not useless yet. The Business Section of the St. Petersburg ( Florida ) Times asked readers for ideas on \"How Would You Fix The Economy?\" A senior citizen around 80 yrs. of age nailed it! Here is what he wrote:   Dear Mr. President, Please find below my suggestion for fixing America 's economy. Instead of giving billions of dollars to companies t......hat will squander the money on lavish parties and unearned bonuses, use the following plan. You can call it the \"Patriotic Retirement Plan\": There are about 40 million people over 50 in the work force. Pay them $1 million apiece severance for early retirement with the following stipulations: 1) They MUST retire. Forty million job openings - Unemployment fixed! 2) They MUST buy a new AMERICAN Car. Forty million cars ordered - Auto Industry fixed! 3) They MUST either buy a house or pay off their mortgage - Housing Crisis fixed! It can't get any easier than that!!   P.S. If more money is needed, have all members in Congress pay their taxes..   Mr. President, while you're at it, make Congress retire on Social Security and Medicare. I'll bet both programs would be fixed pronto!   If you think this would work, please forward to everyone you know.  My additional PS: Discontinue financial aid to countries who hate us and add those funds into the this new retirement plan.",

Right.  Let‚Äôs get roasted.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIs it just me, or does Hobbie have the most punchable face in the galaxy?  I‚Äôd like nothing more than to sock him right in his mopey, slack, girly-lipped face.‚Äù  Aww, you like my lips.  ‚ÄúI bet Simone gives really halfhearted tit-fucks.‚Äù  Wes, is that you?  ‚ÄúI hope Wedge‚Äôs dick falls off.  In public.‚Äù  How much did Jonek Vlarr pay you to say that?  ‚ÄúHobbie is delightfully paradoxical in that he he‚Äôs a huge dick with a small cock.‚Äù Compared to Wedge, everybody has a small cock.  ‚ÄúSomeone just told me I could be a clone of Wedge Antilles and I don‚Äôt know whether to take a thousand selfies or put a blaster to my head.‚Äù  Put it in your mouth if you want to make sure.  ‚ÄúSimone always looks like she needs something very basic explained to her.  Seriously, is that bitch just high on drugs all the time?‚Äù  Well, that‚Äôs not the mark of an amateur - you can‚Äôt even specify which drugs you think I‚Äôm on.  [whispers] It‚Äôs Pleezer. [wink]  ‚ÄúHobbie is so annoying when he eats...or laughs...or speaks...or exists.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt agree more.  ‚ÄúWedge‚Äôs snaggleteeth bother the fek out of me.  They look like a mouthful of Tik Taks throwing gang signs.‚Äù And here‚Äôs a smile just for you. That‚Äôs actually hilarious.  ‚ÄúHow does Simone look anorexic and fat at the same time? Weird.‚Äù I think that's called being a healthy weight. I could be wrong.  ‚ÄúKlivian is a sewer rat who got turned into a human being and became a sex offender.‚Äù These unauthorised biographies are getting out of hand.  ‚ÄúI imagine Wedge smells like a Wookiee‚Äôs toilet brush.‚Äù  You‚Äôve smelled a Wookiee‚Äôs toilet brush?  Damn, son.  ‚ÄúSimone‚Äôs forehead the size of my ass cheek.  And you should know that I weigh over 110 kilos.‚Äù  You should know that it‚Äôs called a fivehead.  Feigning ignorance is no way to land a burn.  ‚ÄúJust gonna throw this out there.  I hate Hobbie.  I hate his mouth-breathing face.  I hate his dumb fake name.  I hate how he‚Äôs better known for wrecking ships than doing anything productive in them.  I hate how he always looks like he‚Äôs about to start ugly-crying because the waitress fekked up his order.  I hate the smug way way he stares at Simone now like, ‚ÄòYeah, I‚Äôm sticking my knob in that.‚Äô  I hate you, you potato-headed bastard.‚Äù  Oh, you just had to bring potatoes into this, didn‚Äôt you?  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like Simone‚Äôs titties are a mid-school dance where the boys stand on one side of the room and the girls stand on the other.‚Äù  And you‚Äôd know all about mid-school, using the word ‚Äòtitties‚Äô.    ‚ÄúEvery short, smug, mediocre-looking human male is Wedge to me.‚Äù I thought these were supposed to be hate comments.  ‚ÄúHobbie looks like his voice is putting his face to sleep.‚Äù And my middle finger is putting you in your place.  ‚ÄúSimone is a crazy-eyed Worlport ghetto trash bag and someday I‚Äôm going to knock her bitch ass out.‚Äù  Hobbie, tell your mother she wishes.  ‚ÄúI think Klivian will fit right in on Corellia.  We have a lot of sarcastic, unlikeable, egotistical assholes here.‚Äù Yes, it seems you do.  ‚ÄúHey, Antilles!  Eat a sack of dicks, you half-melted-candle-looking wanker!‚Äù Nah, I just had lunch; I‚Äôm good.  You dig right in, though.  ‚ÄúYou know Simone has got the most stretched-out busted-up pussy of all time.  You could probably fit the Rogues‚Äô entire fleet of X-Wings up there.  With the foils open.‚Äù  Never could take rejection, could you, Reignbos?  ‚ÄúWedge is kind of a phenomenon, when you think about the struggle of balancing that giant head and that massive ego on that wormy little body.‚Äù I‚Äôm just overrun with talent.      ‚ÄúWedge and Hobbie look like those misshapen fruits the supermarkets try to push on you because they still taste just as good as the stuff that looks right.‚Äù  [Wedge] We do taste good - not that you‚Äôll ever find out.  ‚ÄúOh, look.  Simone‚Äôs still a cunt.‚Äù Hmm.  Imagine if I put time and effort into it.  ‚ÄúI would rather break off my own arm and fuck myself in the ass with it than spend another nano listening to Hobbie and Simone giggle hysterically at nothing.‚Äù [Simone] Kinky.  [Hobbie] We'd pay to see that.",

WEDGE: That cake not only receives a XXX taste bud rating, it's so dark it practically has an event horizon.  I wish Simone and Hobbie would eat stuff like that on The Ord Ralltiiri Experiment, instead of cabbage soda or five layers of hate sundae.  DANIELLE: You and Hobbie need take a load of our stuff home. Spend an entire episode breaking down what we sell and getting fat.  WEDGE: Might take you up on that. No fruit toast, though.  DANIELLE: No, Rogue Leader, no backing out of the fruit toast. Especially after this morning - I'm ready to properly drag the next motherfucker who orders it.  We need Simone and Hobbie on this case.  Only they can see through the hype.  WEDGE: Hobbie can already tell you it's overrated - and disgusting besides. Like something his mother would eat before she went on a permanent crash diet.  And Simone isn't going to look up from that truffle cake.  You won't find any straight answers there.",

./conversations/linkedin-Kyle Lumpkin.json:                "I worked alongside Steve as an individual contributor through 2014 and as his direct manager for the majority of 2015.I really can't say enough good things about Steve.  He was one of our top contributors selling in an emerging and hyper competitive market.  As a colleague he has an infectious passion about his day to day.  He's a pleasure to work with, and a man of strong character and conviction.  He has a positive impact on those around him with his optimistic perspective and belief in whatever he is doing.  He‚Äôs just a great human being and someone you should develop a friendship with if you‚Äôre so inclined; you‚Äôll be better for it.Steve has one of the strongest work ethics I've seen.  He is relentless in his approach, putting the hours in to be successful.  He does the basics, as well as the hard things that no one else wants to do to generate pipeline and opportunity, and more importantly he does it with a smile on his face and can do attitude.Steve does everything his leaders ask him to do.  This sounds basics but I actually find it to be a rare commodity and a breath of fresh air as a leader.  The level of management Steve requires is minimal, and when he does need some help, he's usually already formulated the right approach.There were several instances I observed first hand where Steve built a relationship with a customer I didn't think would ever buy from us.  The same is true of prospects we had some engagement with previously, but lost the deal or project.  Steve actually snatched some victories from the jaw of defeat when no one gave him a shot at turning it around.I learned over the course of working with Steve to trust his sales intuition.  When Steve says something is going to progress, or that there is a risk to the deal, he was right almost every time.  When he was wrong, it was caution.  I appreciate that, leaving nothing to chance, because after all, we are paid to be paranoid as salesmen.Steve helped us build one of our emerging business units in Data at Rackspace.  With it came an extremely complicated product set, nearly constant changes to operations, product, and sales alignment.  Things like training, marketing, lead generation and standard contract vehicles are all things we didn‚Äôt have and are arguably table stakes to being a successful seller.  Steve handled these challenges like the seasoned professional he is and helping build from the ground up.In summary, I am a lifetime Steve Gillig promoter.  If you have the chance to hire him, or retain him, do it.To whom it may concern, please reach out to me personally if you‚Äôd like to chat in more detail and hear more about my experience working with Steve."

On one hand im definitely addicted to checking for updates every 10 minutes even though I know nothing new happened. On another hand it's the only way I really get updated about events and things happening locally.   For example, I feel I would really miss out on local shows and all my friends events if I deleted FB, but I hate checking it and I know I'm waisting crazy amounts of time on it. I'd love a separate FB event app  kinda like how messenger has its own app. But I'm pretty sure FB would never consider that because they'd lose a LOT of people like me who are addicted to scrolling aimlessly through feeds. So for the moment I'm stuck.   Even though FB has connected people more then ever all of these connections feel a lot less genuine.  üåà ü¶Ñ",

So we did!  We went out to lunch after a leisurely morning.  After lunch to my surprise she took me took me to this place I had not been before.  It was a massage parlor of sorts!  We walked in and all the therapists were Asian!  I started wondering who this day was for!  She knows I have a thing for Asians! (What male doesn't).   So she picks out an Asian guy for her and an Asian girl for me!  (Those of you who remember the co-worker nurse of hers that she brought to my 40th birthday party know Dea knows how to pick them for me)!   Anyway the massage starts along with the rub down and lotions!  But I guess because my wife was there, the chic would not rub any lotion above my knees!  Then she proceeded to give me a pedi!  Then I realized it wasn't one of the Asian parlors I was used too!  So today I had my first pedi ever and I had to because I promised I would do whatever Dea wanted to do today!

On top of that, I'm expecting to hear back from another job tomorrow that would be more of what I actually wanted to do, and would be direct-hire and only a 15-30 minute commute a day. I was honest with the recruiter about the other job, and he informed me that I had to make a decision right then and there. Not much time to think about it. The recruiter seemed puzzled when I respectfully declined. Yes, I am aware that there is a fair chance that I won't get the job I actually want and be back to square one, but I still felt pretty good about not compromising my time away from my family and keeping my integrity in tact.

Oppps...he left it at home. Found a notebook, gave it to him and yet he is drawing stick humans.  Today : The whole stack of printouts I gave him is missing. It's not at home nor on his office desk.

./conversations/abe_pralle-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Ivan Kelly Seth on Finding Peace:  You form whatever reality that you know. You have always done this. The heaven and hell that you think of, this is your own experience, the consequences of your actions. There is in some distant, ultimate time, a returning to that from which you have come. But when you return to that from which you have come, when you return to what you think of as God, by then new creativity will have already begun, consciousness will evolve in new ways and there will be new challenges.  There is no end. This does not mean that there is no peace, for peace is within you now. If you would but realize it, it is within you. It is closer to you than breath. It is closer to you than your own pulse. It is as close to you as you are. You are co-creators.  What you call God is the sum of all consciousness and yet the whole is more than the sum of its parts. God is more than the sum of all personalities, and yet all personalities is what He is. There is constant creation, but peace is to be found in creation. There is a force within you that allows you to breathe. There is a force within you that knew how to grow you from a fetus to a grown adult. This force is part of the innate knowledge within all consciousness and it is a part of the God within you.  The responsibility for your life and your world is indeed yours. It has not been forced upon you by some outside agency. You form your own dreams and you form your own physical reality.  I told Ruburt (Jane) today that God has given you the greatest of all gifts and the most awesome. He has given you what you want. The world is what you want as individuals and as races. The world is what you are. You look at the state of the world and you find the physical materialization of the inner selves which have formed it. You look at nature and you find the joy that is within you that you have also formed outward. You look at the good and it is a reflection of the good that is within you, within each individual person, multiplied outward millions of times for each individual within the planet. And there is no man that hates but that hatred is reflected outward and made physical. And there is no man that loves but that that love is reflected outward and made physical.   I want you to realize that you as you understand yourselves to be, your individuality, is not changed by this. I have had this same personality with some minor changes throughout the ages, and you are stuck with yours as I am stuck with mine. All the abilities that I have now I have always had. And you have abilities that you are not using, you see, and the sooner you learn to use them the better it will be for you. I want you to realize that while I no longer inhabit your physical system, the human personality that is mine and thus has filled many physical forms, still exists. I am still learning. I still have work to do and you will still have work to do. You will set challenges for yourselves.  There is a short time between lives when you rest and when you take stock of what you have learned and where you are. But true peace is within you now. And if you do not realize it, it is not because peace does not exist. It is because you have closed yourselves off from peace, and joy springs out of peace.  Joy cannot come from unease and dissatisfaction.  You will not find peace after this unless you know peace within yourselves now. The kingdom of peace is not on some planet, not four blocks down and three blocks across, not a million light years away and miraculously will you find it. The kingdom of peace is within each of you now and if you realize this, then indeed you dwell in peace and from peace comes your security and confidence and joy.  ~ Seth (Jane Roberts), 'The Early Class Sessions'; ESP Class March 12, 1968.

I will meet new people and do fun things, but im not going to leave Brianna. This is something i must do, to see if it works out. if i just quit now, ill never know, and i cant do that. ive never quit anything ive ever started, and im not going to do that now.  you will tolerate it if i want to stay in one night instead of going out to have a good time and you will tolerate me visiting her and her visiting me and it wont be every weekend. you don't have to like any of it but if you are a friend you will respect it, and support it .

./conversations/Trillian/logs/old logs/AIM/EricGFoehner.log:[03/07/2006 08:59 PM] Me: well then maybe you should become a good person, learn from other people, wasn't it you that we stood under the shelter with while it rained and laughed at all the stupid people?  i learned to not only learn from my mistakes but the mistakes of others, thanks to you.  you said the other night that you hate the way i change when i am around other people.  maybe that's because when i am around you and tony i constantly have to defend myself because you will pick apart every mistake i make.  maybe you should reevaluate the way you treat your friends.  or just me...

If you haven't already, Please do!  Set the Intention to receive exactly what you need at this time Versus what you THINK you want, yes, I said it right, and I am going to give you a perfect example of what I mean.  As all of you know I am a dog lover, I have never seen pets as dogs, but as my fur babies, the bond I have with these precious beings is a special strong bond.   Candy girl my precious pet of 16 years passed on about 6 months ago, I miss her so much and I think of her every day üôè  I have been wanting to get another dog for a while, I have been very set on the idea that \"I wanted\" a small, cute, fluffy and \"perfect\" purse dog that I can take with me everywhere I am able to, as most of you know besides teaching Yoga and Pilates, Energy Healing Work and Spiritual Guidance is mainly what I do nowadays in town and with out of town clients, so blessed to be able to do what I truly love üôè üåû  going back to what I thought I wanted, Chris and I were set on the idea to get a dog after the holidays for various valid reasons, We agreed on the fact that we would get that fluffy, perfect, cute, little purse dog in a few months, for the past few weeks I have been getting pretty clear strong visions and intuitive guidance from my guardian angels to do more work with Animals, not the fluffy, cute animals, but the animals that are neglected, abandoned, abused, the animals that people do not want, the animals that are usually overlooked at the shelters and only end up getting Euthanized üòû üòî üò¢ The image, the feeling of helping these precious beings kept getting stronger and stronger, clearer and clearer and just like that I decided to follow my heart, I decided to adopt and also be a foster mommy and work with these precious animals, mind you I have a crazy full schedule already with a million things going on, a fluffy purse fur baby  would be ideal for my busy life, but at this time I choose to concentrate in all that \"I need\"versus what I think I want, I choose to contribute to the healing of these fur Angels, big or small, I am contributing to the healing of the world, the healing of humanity, I choose to shine my light, and make a difference In the life of these precious creatures, when your intention is good, God and the Angels will help you, will guide you in taking the right steps needed to make a positive change in the world.   Two nights ago I ran into a post on Facebook about Coco, a dog that was scheduled to be put down, she had less than 24 hrs To be adopted or fostered or else, the minute that I saw her picture, I knew that I was meant to help her, I knew and felt that she was meant to teach me so much I need to know, crazy I know, but instead of being fearful about the challenges and inconveniences I may run into, My heart chooses to be open to receive exactly what I need at this time, I know God will guide me through yet another challenge that I have chosen to take on , I invite you to get out of your comfort zone, to be fearless!  open your heart to receive exactly what you need in this present moment, whatever serves for your spiritual growth and your mission in this unlimited beautiful Universe, Shine and Share your light, the world needs it more than ever!!

Do you want the oil industry and big corporations to feel your voice right now today and tomorrow, this whole week. They will notice quickly. It would only take days for them to feel the effect. Please Join the Revolution and strike. Sit down with your family and discuss these ideas.  1.Do not drive your vehicle anywhere unless you need to. Stay home as much as possible.   2. Do not purchase processed food or food in plastic containers or drinks in plastic containers. Not unless you have to. You can buy stainless steel or aluminum water containers and take your own water to work. You don't have to drink water from a plastic bottle.   3. Do not eat out. Not unless you're eating at a privately owned Family Restaurant. Do not visit corporate restaurants. Try to eat at home. If you work... pack a lunch.   4. Do not buy Plastic Products, cut back. please.   5. Shut your lights off. Unplug appliances when they are not being used. Cut back.   6. Shut the television off unless you're watching it. If you really want to go gun ho' do not watch any news stations on your television and promote their ratings. Shut your TV off and get your news from your phone. Real Truthful transparent news cant be heard on television anyway.   7. If you live down south or out west start a garden. Grow some of your own vegetables. It's probably too late now if you live in the north but you can consider it next year.  8. Stop at those fruit and vegetable stands that you see on the side of the roads. Shop there. Give those people your money.   9. If at all possible purchase as many organic food items as you can afford.   10. Whatever groups revolutions strikes athletes you support, let them know that your family is supporting them and what they believe in.   11. Dedicate yourself to making 5-10 phone calls every single day and 5-10 emails everyday. You can call/email your local government your state government and your federal government to make complaints. Make a list of those phone numbers and email addresses for your friends and family and post them.   12. When you speak out make sure you speak louder and further. Make sure everything that you speak and post is correct information and the truth. Add more friends to your Facebook.   13. Take white shoe polish and write #nodapl on your vehicles. If you support a Green Party candidate get their sticker on your car. Make the same signs and put them on the outside of your homes. #cleanenergy theres lots of hashtags you can display. #nomorewar #youcantdrinkoil It's always good to use a hashtag on your signs so that people can go there and find more support and knowledge.

./conversations/ReallyBadPerson-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Juan Klaffchez Koalas are fucking horrible animals.  They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.  Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.  Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...  Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.  Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).  When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.  This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence.  Why?  Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.  Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:  Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.  An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.  Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.  If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.

I was intrigued by the idea of a US-based, WordPress-focused hosting company. Then I met Josh and his wife at WordCamp San Francisco. They were charming and personable. Page.ly offered to sponsor the East Bay WordPress Meetup and we have had our website there since 2010. The service has been solid, secure, and reliable. I pester Josh personally via Twitter whenever I have a problem. He sends me to support, but they always respond quickly and get whatever it is sorted out in record time. Josh is good at communicating with his customers and works steadily to improve the service that Page.ly offers. I look forward to working more with Josh and with Page.ly in the future."

Ask for what you want.<br>Let us be clear on this one:<br>Subtle hints do not work!<br>Strong hints do not work!<br>Obvious hints do not work!<br>Just say it!<br><br>1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. <br>That's what we do.<br>Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.<br>In fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days.<br><br>1. If you think you're fat, you probably are.<br>Don't ask us.<br><br>1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one<br><br>1. You can either ask us to do something<br>Or tell us how you want it done.<br>Not both.<br>If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br><br>1. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br><br>1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.<br><br>1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.<br>Peach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit.<br>We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>1. If it itches, it will be scratched.<br>We do that.<br><br>1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," We will act like nothing's wrong.<br>We know you are lying but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br>1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br><br>1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really .<br><br>1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as Football<br>Or Hockey.<br><br>1. You have enough clothes.<br><br>1. You have too many shoes.<br><br>1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape!<br><br>Thank you for reading this.<br>Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;<br><br><br>But did you know men really don't mind that? It's like camping.<br></span></p></div><span class="text_exposed_hide"> <span class="text_exposed_link"><a class="see_more_link" onclick="var func = function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }; var parent =

Have you asked the Universe Today to send to your Life exactly the right people, situations, experiences, clarity, wisdom, whatever situation serves your highest good at this time?  If you haven't already, Please do!  Set the Intention to receive exactly what you need at this time Versus what you THINK you want, yes, I said it right, and I am going to give you a perfect example of what I mean.  As all of you know I am a dog lover, I have never seen pets as dogs, but as my fur babies, the bond I have with these precious beings is a special strong bond.   Candy girl my precious pet of 16 years passed on about 6 months ago, I miss her so much and I think of her every day üôè  I have been wanting to get another dog for a while, I have been very set on the idea that \"I wanted\" a small, cute, fluffy and \"perfect\" purse dog that I can take with me everywhere I am able to, as most of you know besides teaching Yoga and Pilates, Energy Healing Work and Spiritual Guidance is mainly what I do nowadays in town and with out of town clients, so blessed to be able to do what I truly love üôè üåû  going back to what I thought I wanted, Chris and I were set on the idea to get a dog after the holidays for various valid reasons, We agreed on the fact that we would get that fluffy, perfect, cute, little purse dog in a few months, for the past few weeks I have been getting pretty clear strong visions and intuitive guidance from my guardian angels to do more work with Animals, not the fluffy, cute animals, but the animals that are neglected, abandoned, abused, the animals that people do not want, the animals that are usually overlooked at the shelters and only end up getting Euthanized üòû üòî üò¢ The image, the feeling of helping these precious beings kept getting stronger and stronger, clearer and clearer and just like that I decided to follow my heart, I decided to adopt and also be a foster mommy and work with these precious animals, mind you I have a crazy full schedule already with a million things going on, a fluffy purse fur baby  would be ideal for my busy life, but at this time I choose to concentrate in all that \"I need\"versus what I think I want, I choose to contribute to the healing of these fur Angels, big or small, I am contributing to the healing of the world, the healing of humanity, I choose to shine my light, and make a difference In the life of these precious creatures, when your intention is good, God and the Angels will help you, will guide you in taking the right steps needed to make a positive change in the world.   Two nights ago I ran into a post on Facebook about Coco, a dog that was scheduled to be put down, she had less than 24 hrs To be adopted or fostered or else, the minute that I saw her picture, I knew that I was meant to help her, I knew and felt that she was meant to teach me so much I need to know, crazy I know, but instead of being fearful about the challenges and inconveniences I may run into, My heart chooses to be open to receive exactly what I need at this time, I know God will guide me through yet another challenge that I have chosen to take on , I invite you to get out of your comfort zone, to be fearless!  open your heart to receive exactly what you need in this present moment, whatever serves for your spiritual growth and your mission in this unlimited beautiful Universe, Shine and Share your light, the world needs it more than ever!!

As Hillary‚Äôs ca üòµ mpaign gained momentum, she resolved the party‚Äôs debt and put it on a starvation diet. It had become dependent on her campaign for survival, for which she expected to wield control of its operations.  Debbie was not a good manager. She hadn‚Äôt been very interested in controlling the party‚Äîshe let Clinton‚Äôs headquarters in Brooklyn do as it desired so she didn‚Äôt have to inform the party officers how bad the situation was. How much control Brooklyn had and for how long was still something I had been trying to uncover for the last few weeks.

In MY most ultimate display of Progressivism, I'm gonna take that assertion, snap it right the fuck over my knee and SHOW you what a REAL Democrat.  Looks Like.  . . . .   I never met either one of my grandfathers.  They were both passed away by the time I was old enough to have memories.  I know I was at least held by my Mom's dad.  I don't know if my dad's dad ever got that chance.  What I've come to learn of the man is that he pretty much is Don Draper.  Korean War Switcheroo, womanizing . . . meh, maybe not.  BUT.  He was born poor.  Had nothing but his charm to get by, and he did so tremendously, to the point of literally becoming a successful advertising executive on . . . Madison Avenue.  First in his family with some money, so after the classic Manhattan \"Playboy\" apartment a couple blocs away from the UN, it was time to move the family to Scarsdale.  So after working his life into order, meeting and marrying his Firecracker of a wife, my grandmother Annette, the house in the Burbs, the two cars, and the 401k, he looked around at his life and UNLIKE Don, said to himself, \"I could be doing more for other people.\"  So, he took his Firecracker of a wife and they, together threw whatever they could into the effort to desegregate the schools of the district.  They were the \"Point - To\" White people.  By that time, my dad, the middle child had been born, an older brother, a younger sister.  Two cars, the backyard and a place \"outside of town\" for family getaways.  AND they were working on making the world a better place.  Apple Pie AF.  EXCEPT.  That my grandfather is Jewish.  EXCEPT.  That my grandmother called every single number in the school phone book to get \"another\" white boy besides my dad to show up at black kids birthday party, to NO success.  EXCEPT.  That EVERY. MORNING. Again, to NO success, my same grandmother would get up to wash the words \"N***er Lovers\" off of their fence, HOPEFULLY before the kids would have to see, for their efforts in confronting the ugliness of the day Face On.  They did, and my dad went on to found an educational non - profit in SF's Hunters Point District, the equivalent to a Harlem or Compton for SF.  So . . .  When some. DUMB. SHIT. CENTRIST. Tries to call me a Nazi . . .   It just goes to show how far OUT of your element, YOU ARE when it comes to credibly discussing American Politics.  It just goes to show how much you lean on 100% Factually WRONG information.  It just goes to show how much you would prefer to tap into the deepest, most regrettable decisions made by man BEFORE you take a single look in the mirror.  *Update, upon learning that I was Jewish, I was told,  1.  They could smell my Matzah Balls burning  2.  That my family was actually Jewish, Nazi wannabees, suffering from a sever case of Stockholm syndrome.  3.  That my time would be better spent making bagels, and lox and robbing people.  And finally that   4.  \"Anti semitism is fun!\"  Centrists.  FOR. ONE. SINGLE. TIME.

./conversations/CatsCauseTypos-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Susie Robertshaw From a friend who knows what's up, some advice for those interested in effective protest:  From a high-level staffer for a Senator:  There are two things that all Democrats [NB: Democrats and/or all decent human beings] should be doing all the time right now, and they're by far the most important things. [If you want to share this, please copy and paste so it goes beyond our mutual friends.]  --> You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.  1. The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time - if they have townhalls, go to them. Go to their local offices. If you're in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the \"mobile offices\" that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson's website). When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.  2. But, those in-person events don't happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.  You should make 6 calls a day: 2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.  The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story - but even then it's not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).  Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to. Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics. They're also sorted by zip code and area code. She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it's a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it's often closer to 11-1, and that's recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven't.  So, when you call:  A) When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you're calling about (\"Hi, I'd like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please\") - local offices won't always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don't, that's ok - ask for their name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone. Don't leave a message (unless the office doesn't pick up at all - then you can...but it's better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).  B) Give them your zip code. They won't always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they'll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.  C) If you can make it personal, make it personal. \"I voted for you in the last election and I'm worried/happy/whatever\" or \"I'm a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,\" or \"as a single mother\" or \"as a white, middle class woman,\" or whatever.  D) Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don't go down a whole list - they're figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn't really matter - even if there's not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It's important that they just keep getting calls.  E) Be clear on what you want - \"I'm disappointed that the Senator...\" or \"I want to thank the Senator for their vote on...\" or \"I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because...\" Don't leave any ambiguity.  F) They may get to know your voice/get sick of you - it doesn't matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they're really sick of you, they'll be gone in 6 weeks.  From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don't worry about it - there are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these day). After a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural. Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P ‚Äì Politician. An example is McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc...) which makes it really easy to click down the list each day. Susie",

Sunday sports, It's like the full moon<br>Or the changing of the tides.<br>Let it be .<br><br>1. Crying is blackmail.<br><br>1. Ask for what you want.<br>Let us be clear on this one:<br>Subtle hints do not work!<br>Strong hints do not work!<br>Obvious hints do not work!<br>Just say it!<br><br>1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br><br>1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. <br>That's what we do.<br>Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br><br>1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument.<br>In fact, all comments become Null and void after 7 Days.<br><br>1. If you think you're fat, you probably are.<br>Don't ask us.<br><br>1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one<br><br>1. You can either ask us to do something<br>Or tell us how you want it done.<br>Not both.<br>If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.<br><br>1. Whenever possible, Please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br><br>1. Christopher Columbus did NOT need directions and neither do we.<br><br>1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings.<br>Peach, for example, is a fruit, not A color. Pumpkin is also a fruit.<br>We have no idea what mauve is.<br><br>1. If it itches, it will be scratched.<br>We do that.<br><br>1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," We will act like nothing's wrong.<br>We know you are lying but it is just not worth the hassle.<br><br>1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, Expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br><br>1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really .<br><br>1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as Football<br>Or Hockey.<br><br>1. You have enough clothes.<br><br>1. You have too many shoes.<br><br>1. I am in shape. Round IS a shape!<br><br>Thank you for reading this.<br>Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight;<br><br><br>But did you know men really don't mind that?

Especially to those of you saying to stop talking about this, stop making assumptions etc.   Call me crazy, call me dramatic, call me whatever you want. I'm posting this for those of us who were on the strip Sunday night, who know what we saw and what we were told by police officers, security guards, and even the local news when all of this madness started. And I am posting this in hopes of informing others who have believed everything they've seen on the news. If while leaving the Cosmopolitan, we had been told there was one shooting at the Mandalay Bay, Anthony and I would have not been worried for our lives and we would have continued to go out, knowing we weren't headed to that particular area of the strip. But that's not what we were told. We were told that there were 7 confirmed shooters, and confirmed deaths at multiple hotels. Including Bellagio, the Aria and New York New York. Being told this by a security guard, who then told us to go to the third floor for safety. However,  Anthony says, \"No Rikki. This is a very popular hotel, I don't feel like the third floor of this popular hotel in public is the safest place. We're going to try and get out of here right now.\" Running back to our hotel next door, Vdara, we are told once again by police/security checking our id and room key, \"yes multiple hotels effected. Go to your room and do not leave.\" We then get to the room, immediately turn on the news and start watching out of our windows to figure out what is going on. The news also states, live, that the Bellagio had been effected and there was one confirmed death.   Now... skip ahead about an hour. The news is no longer stating anything about the other hotels effected. They say it is one person. Every bit of info that was being initially given to us was disappearing. We could physically see from our window view, fire alarms going off at the cosmopolitan, and multiple cop cars and ambulances pulling up there as well. We wanted more information about what was happening at these other hotels right next to us, and we weren't getting it. And we still aren't.   Monday morning I am of course telling my friends and family about our experience, and I was starting to really feel like I was crazy. Everyone was telling me there was only one shooter, and I just couldn't understand what I had seen. Finally, other people like myself started speaking out. I was relieved to know that I wasn't crazy, but now just as confused as to why the media is trying to hide this information. There are now videos and statements popping up all over the web, showing proof of other shooters and other effected hotels.   Why are they trying to hide this?! If for no other reason, think about being a family member of the others who died or were injured at these other hotels. They deserve the respect, and the truth as to what happened to their loved ones.   Now, can we please stop talking about Gun Control for just a few minutes, and figure out what is really going on here? Figure out the real motive of this incident, and inform people of the truth. Laws can be put in place for anything and everything. There will always be people who break them. And especially with all of the technology we have now days, it is not very hard to find anything you want. Whether it's an illegal weapon, drugs, anything. Laws will always be broken. So let's stop pretending this incident wouldn't have happened if more laws were in place, but instead demand the truth about what really happened that night, and why? Don't be so naive.

./conversations/scott_johnson_31149359-posts-2017.json:        "description": "Holli Houston  updated her status. Because I wanted to... tonight's debate, paraphrased:  Cooper: You understand that what you admitted to doing was sexually assaulting women?  Trump: I said some things I'm not proud of, but let's move on to more important things. I will defeat ISIS.  Cooper: Your words described actions that are sexual assault.  Trump: ISIS!  ***  Raddatz: You said you've changed. When did that happen?  Trump: Listen lady, I've apologized. And BILL CLINTON. What about BILL CLINTON? And Michelle Obama doesn't like you, Hillary - nana nana boo boo. Also, Hillary, you stole this election from Bernie. I'm going to have you locked up and the key thrown away.  ***  Raddatz: Secretary Clinton: Let's talk about your emails.  Clinton: Yes, I made a mistake. I take responsibility. Here are some examples of me taking classified information very seriously, but yes, my email situation was a mistake:  Trump: Crucify her.  Cooper: Mr. Trump: Please stop interrupting Mrs. Clinton; she's not interrupting you.  Trump: Yeah - because she has nothing to say. And for the love of all that is holy, why, moderators, aren't you asking her about her emails?  Cooper: Uhhh... that's what we were *just* talking about... ?  ***  Audience member: What about Obamacare?  Clinton: Yes - there are issues. Here are the specific benefits of Obamacare. Here are the specific problems. I have a detailed plan on my webpage about how to fix it - keeping the good, addressing the bad.  Trump: It's a disaster. I'm going to give you a great plan instead. Competition. But it's just a disaster. Nothing good about it. And Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment.  ***  Audience member: What about your stance on Muslims?  Trump: Well, the reason for Islamaphobia is because you Muslims aren't doing your part to report suspicious activity.  ***  Raddatz: What about your ban on Muslims entering the country?  Trump: Well, Captain Khan was a hero but if I'd been president, he wouldn't have died. Because I'm a genius. But NO to Syrians without \"extreme vetting\" because it's the biggest Trojan Horse ever.  Clinton: Think of the children. Let's have effective vetting, but it is unAmerican to support a ban due to religion. The Donald's position is dangerous and making the problems worse.  Trump: And Clinton let in all these illegal aliens who are criminals and hurting us. We will deport them immediately. And did I mention that Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment? He did that. Oh yeah, and ICE endorsed me.  ***  Raddatz: What about this new wikileaks thing? Is it okay for a politician to have different personal and public views?  Clinton: Different arguments work for different people; it's smart to figure out what arguments work best to get to your end game. If it was a good enough strategy for Abe Lincoln, it's good enough for me.  Further, Wikileaks + Russia = dangerous and they don't want me in office. They support Trump and are trying to get him elected because Trump + Putin, sitting in a tree... And we need to see Donald's tax returns.  Trump: You're no Abe Lincoln and I have no relationship with Russia.   And I pay millions in taxes - more than Hillary's friends Buffet and Soros pay -- but I won't release my tax returns until the audit is over.  ***  Audience member: What about tax loopholes for the rich?  Trump: Yes, I take advantage. Hillary never got them changed in all her years in office. I don't care that she was only one senator under a republican president and with a republican congress. This shows how ineffective she was.   Clinton: I don't even know where to begin because everything Trump just said is utter nonsense. Here's my record on the topic.  Trump: Her campaign donors do what I do, but I'm not going to to tell you who they are, because they're not famous like I am. And, did I already mention that Bernie said Hillary has bad judgment? Oh, and Hillary created ISIS.  Clinton: Here's my actual record on this topic.  ***  Raddatz: Let's talk about Syria - what would you do?  Clinton: It's a grave situation. Here are the problems; here are some of my ideas to solve it.  Trump: Clinton was a horrible secretary of state, she was there when Obama drew his line in the sand.  Clinton: Actually, I wasn't still secretary of state at that time.  Trump: Whatever. Facts don't matter. Our military is a disgrace; it's old and tired. Libya. Russia! ISIS! Syria! Iran nuclear deal! Russia, Assad, and Iran are the world's heros.   Raddatz: Pence says we should be prepared to attack Assad if he and Russia continue to do what they're doing.  Trump: I disagree. Now let's talk Iraq and the poor military strategy there. My plan is secret and it will be the best plan.   Raddatz: What if a non-secret plan is a strategic decision - you know, for psychological warfare or other reasons?  Trump: I know of no reason, ever, to not have a secret plan. But I am smarter than everyone else.  Clinton: Here are some details of my plan.  The pros, the cons ‚Äì things I‚Äôve considered.  I will consult with experts.  Trump: She got more time than me. Waaa.  ***  Audience: Can you be the president of all the people of the USA?  Trump: She certainly can‚Äôt.  She called some people deplorable.  I can.  Our inner cities are a disaster.  The Latino-Americans, the African-Americans.  Life is a disaster.  What do you have to lose with me?  Clinton: Here‚Äôs my record of what I have actually done, and I was generally well liked by the people I represented, which was a pretty diverse group.  Trump: Yeah ‚Äì but she called some people deplorable. And irredeemable.  Clinton: My argument is with Trump, not his followers.  I want to be everyone‚Äôs president.  And Bernie supports me now.  ***  Cooper: Do you think it shows good temperment to tell the public to watch a sex tape, via Twitter at 3 a.m.?  Trump: I didn‚Äôt do that.  And Clinton is sometimes awake at 3 a.m., too.  And Twitter is a good means of communication.  ‚ÄúI am not unproud of what I did, to be honest with you.‚Äù  ***  Audience: What about the Supreme Court?  Clinton: Citizens United = bad; Roe v. Wade = Good; marriage equality = good.  Senate should have done its job to fill the vacancy.  Trump: Scalia! Scalia! Scalia!  And the Second Amendment.  And by the way, I‚Äôm contributing way more of my personal money to this campaign than Hillary is to hers.  So there.  ***  Audience: What‚Äôs your energy policy?  Trump: Go backwards; get rid of the EPA! COAL!  Clinton: Energy independence; natural gas = a good bridge on our way to clean and renewable energy.  ***  Audience: Can you say something nice about the other?  Clinton: Trump has nice children.  Trump: She‚Äôs a fighter.  She doesn‚Äôt quit. Holli Houston",

Whatever campground is chosen needs to be accessible by non-fancy cars and trucks.  There is a super-secret place that Heather and I know of, and lake Ashurst will be the backup plan.  If there is any better suggestions, reply soon.  Otherwise, we will assume lake Ashurst.  I will post the final location tomorrow morning on this event.  I would like to get a group out to the campgrounds mid-day to claim a spot, then everyone else can join after work.  Feel free to call me for further collaboration, 928-315-1123.\n"
